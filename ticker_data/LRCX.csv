707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2002,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation is a leading supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, CMP and post-CMP wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past three business cycles, the severity of the semiconductor business cycle has increased. Demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, economic conditions, supply and demand for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive new products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Total Revenue Our total revenues were $943.1 million, $1,519.8 million and $1,230.8 million for fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Total revenue of $1,519.8 million in fiscal 2001 reflected the adoption of SAB 101 as of the beginning of that year. The decrease in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market. During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we began to see signs of a downturn. Excess inventory of telecommunication products, diminished personal computer sales and a slowing economy caused semiconductor companies to sharply reduce capital expenditures and delay or cancel equipment orders. These order reductions had a negative impact on the level of our systems shipments starting in the June 2001 quarter. Revenues decreased across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002. While the overall industry slowed, our customers continued to make selective purchases to support development of processes needed for smaller device feature sizes and for copper and new materials integration, as well as the transition to 300-mm size wafers. Revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 reflected a period of expansion in our served markets driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for increased capacity. In addition, our customers were transitioning to smaller geometries and new materials such as copper. Proportionally, more of our revenue growth can be attributed to our etch family of products. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (""SAB 101""), ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."" Refer to our discussion of ""Critical Accounting Policies"" for additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Based on the guidance provided by SAB 101, we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation. Systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment. Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended -------------------------- June 30, June 24, June 25, 2002 2001 2000 -------- -------- -------- North America...................... 29% 30% 29% Europe............................. 21% 28% 28% Asia Pacific....................... 35% 33% 31% Japan.............................. 15% 9% 12% A modest recovery in demand for wafer fabrication equipment during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter, 2003, compared to the prior quarter, as current manufacturing activity by our customers has improved. Gross Margin Gross margin was $266.1 million, $653.5 million and $541.9 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, gross margins were 28.2%, 43.0% and 44.0% in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes. Additionally inventory write-downs of approximately $24.1 million and a patent litigation settlement charge of $38.8 million, in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and inventory related net restructuring charges, after recoveries, of $5.9 million unfavorably impacted gross margins in fiscal 2002. The decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in the second half of fiscal 2001, due to the industry slowdown. During the last quarter of fiscal 2002, we experienced a favorable gross margin progression due to better capacity utilization of both our factory and field service resources and from the impact of cost reduction programs. Excluding restructuring reserve recovery, gross margin for the June 2002 quarter was 35.9% of total revenue, compared to 33.5% of total revenue in the March 2002 quarter. Our current outlook is for gross margin as a percent of revenue to rise sequentially in the first fiscal quarter, 2003, due to higher revenues and increased production efficiencies. Research and Development R&D expenses were $179.2 million, $227.2 million and $176.9 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expenses were 19.0%, 15.0% and 14.4% for fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The decrease in R&D expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 results from controlled spending on general R&D programs, consistent with the downturn in the business cycle. The increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by expanded levels of investment in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications, including developing the technology necessary to support smaller geometries, new insulating materials, copper-based devices and 300 mm size wafers. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in R&D. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs. We expect to continue making sizeable investments in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications and in enhancing our existing products during fiscal 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (excluding restructuring charges/recoveries) were $161.9 million, $218.9 million and $161.3 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses (excluding restructuring charges/recoveries) were 17.2%, 14.4% and 13.1% in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is largely due to manpower reductions, lower incentive payments to employees, shutdown days and other cost reduction programs. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002, is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by infrastructure expansion needed to sustain higher sales, marketing, and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal 2001. SG&A increased as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2001, largely due to the decline in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Restructuring Charges We have developed restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels. Expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and reorganizations and business exit activities related to discontinued product lines. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans. Although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the nature of our extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective. The recognition of a restructuring event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods. In April 2001, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce up to 15% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 (""the June 2001 Plan""). The reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level of decline in our revenues due to the forecasted contraction of our served market from calendar year 2000 levels. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the June 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $16.8 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for inventories of an etch product line that has been discontinued. In addition, we consolidated our Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote-off the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $1.4 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. We also recovered $0.9 million from certain of our etch product line inventory, previously segregated and written-off. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2001 Plan: LEASE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ABANDONED OTHER AND ON VACATED FIXED DISCONTINUED EXIT BENEFITS FACILITIES ASSETS INVENTORY COSTS TOTAL ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- (in thousands) Fiscal year 2001 provision......$ 8,282 $ 1,312 $ 3,036 $ 3,732 $ 407 $ 16,769 Cash payments...................

Prior to the date of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given the prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. When applicable, anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments. We wrote-off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment and etch product line inventory were abandoned and written-off. Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated with capital improvements to the vacated facilities. Our business outlook in mid to late summer of 2001, indicated further deterioration in semiconductor sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, resulting in a lower outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our revenues. Consequently, in August 2001, we announced a new plan (""the September 2001 Plan"") to further reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, including an approximate 10% reduction-in-force. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the September 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduced our workforce by approximately 550 employees, worldwide prior to September 23, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, write-offs for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for inventories of selected, older etch product lines that were discontinued. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $0.7 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We also recovered $0.8 million from certain of our older etch inventories, previously segregated and written-off and $0.3 million from facilities leases.

The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.9 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont, California. We wrote-off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $0.9 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, we exited selected, older etch product lines and wrote-off the related discontinued manufacturing inventory. The continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year 2001 and its impact on our near-term financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan (""the December 2001 Plan""). In December 2001, we publicly announced our intention to reduce global employment by approximately 12% and further consolidate our facilities. During the second fiscal quarter, the December 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduction of our workforce by approximately 470 employees, worldwide prior to December 30, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets.

Prior to December 30, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $3.6 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont, California. We wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $8.8 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, certain fixed assets of approximately $1.1 million associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and written-off. As summarized above, restructuring activities have had a significant impact on our operating results. As discussed under ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" below, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 ""Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities"" (FAS 146). Had FAS 146 been applicable when we undertook our restructuring activities, the timing and amount of the charges recognized may have been different than those reported. FAS 146 is applicable to restructuring activities initiated on or after December 31, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. FAS 146 does not apply to our previous restructuring activities. Asset Impairment Charges During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that the carrying value of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment to be disposed of exceeded its fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was assessed using the market values of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment. Impairment occurred due to rapid technological changes brought about by the semiconductor industry's move to copper and 300-mm applications. In accordance with FAS 121, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of"", we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.5 million. A $5.3 million write-down to fair value of certain laboratory tools is included in R&D expenses and $4.2 million of write-downs to fair value of demonstration equipment are included in SG&A expenses. Remaining equipment with carrying values totaling $1.1 million is reviewed quarterly for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next 12 months. Patent Litigation Settlement On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years) and issued a warrant with a fair value of $21.5 million that entitled Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $21.30 per share. As part of the full and final settlement, Varian and Lam agreed to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims relating to the litigation. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million in the quarter ended December 30, 2001, which represents approximately 93% of the total value of the settlement. The remaining portion of the total value of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents, $2.7 million, is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters. The imputed value of the warrant was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model were an expected life of 4 years, anticipated stock price volatility of 61% and a risk-free interest rate of 4.5%. Purchased Technology for Research & Development During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio of CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh. We recognized a one-time charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in-process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets. Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of Strasbaugh's total capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years. Based on our analysis of Strasbaugh's current and expected financial performance, we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other-than-temporary impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Our equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was ($0.8) million and $0.7 million, respectively. The income (loss) has not been material, and, therefore, has not been itemized in other income, net, on the accompanying statements of operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, we purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc (""Oliver""). We recognized an expense for the purchase of research and development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. The technology is being used in a next generation product development project and has no future alternative use. Other Income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, was ($8.2) million, $15.1 million and $7.0 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates in fiscal 2002, the non-taxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to Lam stock, and the decrease in foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances. The increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by higher interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we applied Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") Issue No. 00-19, in accounting for our equity derivatives indexed to our own stock. In accordance with EITF 00-19, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset. The cumulative change was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement, if any, will be non-taxable. We adjust the carrying value of these derivative instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or lose in our statement of operations. For additional information about our accounting for these equity derivatives, refer to our discussion of Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock, included in Critical Accounting Polices in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Based on a June 28, 2002 stock price of $17.98, the fair value of the equity derivatives was $24.8 million, which resulted in a non-taxable loss of $8.2 million for fiscal 2002. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our effective annual income tax rate was 31.7%, excluding the loss on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal year 2002, and 30.0% and 13.5% in fiscal years 2001 and 2000, respectively. The cumulative loss from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock is non-taxable. The fiscal year 2000 rate reflected the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, income tax benefit was recorded using a 10.0% tax rate estimate; income tax benefit in subsequent fiscal 2002 quarters was recorded using a 30.0% tax benefit rate estimate. The increase in the tax benefit rate results from the tax benefit of the R&D credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and our continued and substantial investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for R&D tax benefits. Deferred Tax Assets We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards of $290.4 million, $244.1 million and $202.5 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $52.2 million, $31.2 million and $94.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $26.7 million, $35.6 million and $19.0 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and we believe that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted profitability. However, there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Outsourcing We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these capabilities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly with our customers, what we sell. Most other activities in the company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, over the last 15 months, we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, facilities management and information technology functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs may provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down, in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to requirements generated by the cyclical nature of our business. Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business. Related Party Transactions During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. At June 30, 2002, the entire principal amount, $1.0 million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable, in full, together with accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005. Subsequent Events The 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, (""5% Notes""), matured on September 2, 2002 and were repaid in full. This resulted in a cash outlay of approximately $309.8 million. At the end of August 2002, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock with a market value of $47.6 million ($13.60 per share) by physically settling certain put and call option contracts (equity derivative contracts), which gave us the right to repurchase the shares for $39.1 million ($11.19 per share) from independent third parties. By settling the equity derivative contracts, we were able to repurchase the shares at a discount of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from their fair market value. As a result of this transaction, we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million. From June 30, 2002 through the settlement date, the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock over the same period. This reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value will be included in our earnings for the quarter ending September 29, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we will recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications. Revenue related to spare parts sales, system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (""SAB 101""), ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."" Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Company's revenue recognition policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment. As a result of our change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and the cumulative effect of the change on our financial statements, the deferred revenue balance upon adopton of SAB 101, as of June 26, 2000, was $433.0 million, consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000. Of this amount, we recognized revenue of $29.1 million and $401.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. At June 30, 2002, the deferred revenue balance, including $2.9 million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment, was approximately $121.2 million. Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock: In November 2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") reached final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-19, ""Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer"", for the purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13, ""Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock"" (""EITF 00-19""). EITF 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock (""equity derivatives"") by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary equity and assets and liabilities. Under EITF 00-19, equity derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be re-classified as assets or liabilities. To qualify as permanent equity, all the following criteria must be met: the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can be no ""make whole"" provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value, and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contract classification occurs. Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations. Lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to our own stock. Application of EITF 00-19 requires these instruments be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period, the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or loss on our statement of operations. Our equity derivatives are collateralized by restricted cash of $9.1 million and may not be settled in unregistered shares. In accordance with EITF 00-19, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of these put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset. The June 24, 2001 cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), was based on a June 24, 2001 stock price of $28.50. The cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement will be non-taxable. Based on a June 28, 2002, stock price of $17.98, the $24.8 million fair value of the equity derivatives resulted in a non-taxable loss of $8.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2002. The loss is recorded in Other Income (Expense)in the June 2002 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the options is recorded in Other Current Assets. See ""Subsequent Events"" included herein Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""for information concerning the settlement of our equity derivatives. Refer to Item 7A, ""Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk"" for additional information about our investments in equity derivative financial instruments. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market using standard costs, which approximate actual cost. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers, we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products. Standard costs are generally re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead for manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to fully absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. The assembly outsourcing initiative has and will continue to alter the composition of reported cost of sales. Over time, proportionately more costs will comprise purchased materials and less will represent manufacturing labor and overhead, reflecting the substitution of our assembly activities with the purchase of completed modules and integrated units from new outsource assembly vendors. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months based on estimated customer product orders is written-down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management's estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Installation and Warranty: Typically, part of marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes installing and providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We generally record actual labor and material expenses for installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue recognition. We also provide a contractual performance warranty on our systems, the period of which runs concurrent with the system installation process, generally 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as a new, simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements. Where customer and system specific installation and warranty reserves are established, all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses incurred on a system-by-system basis, and overall, may differ from our original estimates. While we consistently monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified provisions or reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent 12 months ended June 30 2002, all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the company provides customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services, with a term of more than one month, are recognized on a prorated straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. At June 30, 2002, warranty reserves were $15.5 million, compared to $28.3 million at June 24, 2001. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans: We account for our stock purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ""Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees"" (""APB 25"") and make pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, ""Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation"" (""FAS 123""), were followed. Our employee stock purchase plan is a non-compensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Because our stock-based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees. Deferred Income Taxes: We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future estimated taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options. When these tax benefits are realized, the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Impairment or Disposals of Long-Lived Assets: In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (""FAS 144""), ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long- Lived Assets"". FAS 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"", and applies to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations). We are required to adopt FAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal 2003. FAS 144 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results. Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities: In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 ""Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities"" (""FAS 146""). FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, ""Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)"" (""EITF 94-3""). The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relates to FAS 146's requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. FAS 146 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations. Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities: In June 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements ""Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities""(the proposed Interpretation or Exposure Draft) that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of special-purpose entities (""SPE""). The proposed Interpretation will apply to any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with an SPE. The Exposure Draft provides guidance for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a SPE, that functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The proposed Interpretation may result in our having to consolidate the operating results of a SPE or similar entity, which is a lessor under one of our operating lease agreements. The FASB expects to issue the Interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002. The effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending June 2003, and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules' effective date which utilize SPEs or equivalent lease structures. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability. Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: In May 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation that would require a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The proposed Interpretation would also require a company (""the guarantor"") to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The proposed Interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent measurement of the guarantor's recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. The proposed Interpretaton would also incorporate, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, ""Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others "" which is being superseded. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 25, 2002 and would be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The proposed Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2002, we had $945.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash compared with $925.4 million at June 24, 2001. Subsequent event: The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, matured on September 2, 2002, and were redeemed in cash. The proceeds we used to redeem the 5% Notes came primarily from short-term investments that had matured subsequent to June 30, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.8 million in fiscal 2002. Net loss for the year of $90.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $138.5 million, resulted in positive cash flow of $48.4 million, which was partially offset by uses of working capital totaling $26.6 million. Non-cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization, patent litigation settlement, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, impairment charges and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in company stock. Significant changes in current assets and liabilities resulted from improved accounts receivable turnover and the continued use of programs to selectively sell accounts receivables, which resulted in a $118.2 million improvement. Additionally, highly controlled purchasing processes combined with lower shipments and inventory write-downs for excess, obsolete, and older- generation products reduced inventory by approximately $96.5 million. Accrued liabilities declined by $65.4 million due to reduced compensation and warranty liabilities. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell $187.4 million, in line with equipment delivery trends. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 was $88.1 million, down from $427.5 million in 2001. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2002 included net purchases of short-term investments of $65.4 million and limited capital expenditure projects of $10.6 million. Additionally, restricted cash increased $10.5 million, mostly due to collateral requirements of our interest rate swap agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2002 was $16.3 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated $19.4 million. We repurchased $10.7 million of common stock and reissued $16.3 million of treasury stock through the employee stock purchase program. Principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations were $8.7 million. Property and equipment was $67.5 million at June 30, 2002, compared to $126.5 million at June 24, 2001. The decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily due to minimum expenditures for capital projects during fiscal 2002, write-offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities, and impairments of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment. At June 30, 2002, our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt retirements, lease payments, other long-term liabilities, and outsourced functions are as follow: Debt and other Outsourcing long-term Operating and Consignment liabilities Leases Contracts ------------ ---------- -------------- (in thousands) Through June 29, 2003 (1)........ $ 315,291 $ 63,553 $ 34,321 2004 through 2006................ 359,691 86,909 9,586 2007 and thereafter.............. -- 7,687 ------------ ---------- -------------- Total ......................... $ 674,982 $ 158,149 $ 43,907 ============ ========== ============== (1) The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, mature on September 2, 2002 and are included in the Current Liabilities section of the Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2002. Debt financing includes two Convertible Subordinated Notes and a Yen-denominated term loan. Details of the Convertible notes are: Description 4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, ""4% Notes"" 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, ""5% Notes"" Offering Date May 2001 August 1997 Offering Amount $300.0 million $310.0 million Maturity Date June 1, 2006 September 2, 2002 Offering Expenses $8.5 million incurred at the time of offering, ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the 4% Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $6.7 million and $8.4 million at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, respectively. $9.0 million incurred at the time of offering ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the 5% Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $0.3 million and $2.1 million at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, respectively. Interest Rate terms 4% payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1 2001 5% payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1 1998 Conversion Rights Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $44.93 per share subject to anti-dilution adjustments Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $29.26 per share subject to anti-dilution adjustments Redemption terms Redeemable at Lam option, beginning June 5, 2004 with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest. Redeemable at Lam option, beginning September 6, 2000 with at least 20 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 102.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest, if the closing price of Lam Common Stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days ending within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within 5 trading days prior to the notice of redemption Security 4% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company 5% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we entered into a three-year Yen-denominated term loan for approximately ¥6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) with a syndicate of financial institutions, in order to fund our Japanese subsidiary operations. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a floating interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (""TIBOR""), which at June 30, 2002, was 2.6% per annum. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Company's 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The transaction swapped 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") based interest rate, resulting in interest expense savings of approximately $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. Should 6-month LIBOR interest rates rise above approximately 5% per annum in future periods, incremental interest expense to the Company may be incurred. Under the terms of the transaction, we must provide collateral to match any mark-to-market exposure on the swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to the mark-to-market exposure on the swap. Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark-to-market exposure on the swap instrument. Generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise. At the end of fiscal 2002 we have $10.5 million in restricted cash on our balance sheet (classified as a long-term asset) related to this transaction. The swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Note E of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10K. On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years). The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above includes our cash obligations at June 30, 2002, related to the Varian settlement. We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Generally, all of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain operating leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods. Certain of our other facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Lease agreements relating to certain buildings at our Fremont, California campus, require us to provide guaranteed residual values totaling $97.1 million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in the preceding table ($44.4 million in 2003, $25.2 million in 2005 and $27.5 million in 2006). The lessor associated with one of these lease agreements is a SPE or equivalent structure. Presently, we account for this lease as an operating lease while the SPE owns and accounts for the leased assets and related liabilities. The FASB has issued an Exposure Draft ""Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entites"", a proposed Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of SPEs. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability. Additionally, one of our lease agreements includes collateral restrictions that require us to maintain a certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 30, 2002, in restricted specified interest bearing accounts. These restricted cash accounts must be maintained through March 2003 (unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of required cash collateral is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid down by the lessor. During the second half of fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance and information technology functions. These outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum outsourcing obligations at June 30, 2002 under these arrangements. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the assumption of leases, assets and employees. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as inventory until title is transferred or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 30, 2002, vendor owned inventories held at Lam and not reported as inventory were approximately $15 million. In fiscal 1999, we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties (the ""third parties"") for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of our Common Stock. These call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes previously issued by us, and which became due September 2, 2002. As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized us to enter into the sale of put options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of our Common Stock. We anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call options from those same third parties. Pursuant to the authorization described above, as of June 30, 2002, we have acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock; the weighted-average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the 5% Notes issued in August 1997, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share. On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired. As of June 30, 2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $9.32 per share. The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted or retired. Upon option exercise, we have the ability, at our discretion, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would be delivered to us against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value of the option being exercised) or ""net settled"" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised). Certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counter-party to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments. We can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate Third Party. While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain events (in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation our material breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition, reduction in our S&P credit rating below B or a drop in the price of our Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share. We account for these derivative financial instruments, indexed and potentially settled in our stock, under the provisions of EITF 00-19. At June 30, 2002, the instruments had a net fair value of $24.8 million and are included in ""Other Current Assets"". If the average stock price is below $9.32 during any period, the required number of shares to net settle the Company's obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share (""EPS"") calculation. See ""Subsequent Events"" included herein Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for information concerning the repayment of our 5% Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and the settlement of our equity derivatives. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2002, combined with cash conservation activities, are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, capital expenditures, settlement in cash of our 5% Notes which matured on September 2 2002, and settlement of equity derivative contracts through at least the end of calendar year 2003. In the longer-term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues, and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products. Risk Factors Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, and the equipment industry specifically; the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; customer acceptances of equipment; the size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations and/or acceptances; our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; our competitors' introduction of new products; legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; new or modified accounting regulations; changes in average selling prices and product mix; exchange rate fluctuations; and exposure on interest rate swap agreements. We manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. We derive our revenue primarily from the shipment and acceptance of a relatively small number of high-priced systems. Our systems can range in price from approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenues, and a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Our operating results for a quarter may suffer substantially if: we ship fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter; our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments; we do not receive anticipated purchase orders in time to enable shipment or acceptance of equipment during a given quarter; one or more customers delays or cancels anticipated shipments and/or installations; shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing or transportation difficulties; or our suppliers or outsource vendors fail to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations. Further, because most of our manufacturing and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California facility, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 101 ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."" SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments. Prior to SAB 101, we generally recognized new systems revenue on the date the equipment was shipped to customers. Under SAB 101, we now generally recognize revenue for new equipment on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. In late fiscal 1999, increased demand for our products drove revenue growth throughout fiscal 2000 and early fiscal 2001. In the later part of the December 2000 quarter, we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were considering reductions in equipment purchases during the first half of calendar year 2001. These signs were confirmed in calendar year 2001, as semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity. The resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002. Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility are expected to continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will continue to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at alignment of our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in product research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. For this Reason, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture, and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. Due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products, we strive to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products. If new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace, which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We may be unable in a timely manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, in connection with the development of new products, we will invest in pilot production inventory. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. We are Subject to Risks Associated with the Introduction of New Products We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, our own introduction of new products represents significant investments of our resources and their success, or lack thereof, could have a material effect on our financial results. We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: a decline in demand for our products; a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products; an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Generally, each of our key suppliers has a one-year blanket purchase contract under which we may issue purchase orders. We may renew these contracts periodically. Each of these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers. Several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to Lam; where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect We are expanding the role that outsource providers play in our business. We anticipate that these outsource providers will play keys roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers will fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded role of outsource providers will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor's Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor's Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to that Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment. We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. In addition, there are smaller, emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. We anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics. If our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, it could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. In addition, competitors with higher levels of financial resources than we have may deeply discount or give away products similar to those we sell. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 71% of our total revenue in fiscal 2002, 70% in fiscal 2001 and 71% in fiscal 2000. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. International sales are subject to risks, including, but not limited to: foreign exchange risks; changing import/export requirements; foreign trade disputes; and economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Yen-denominated sales and assets, and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers' acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. Our Ability to Manage Potential Growth or Decline; Integration of Potential Acquisitions and Potential Disposition of Product Lines and Technologies Creates Risks for Us Current conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry challenges our management to control spending on operating activities. If we experience rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform such actions successfully. In the future, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention to other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth, decline, integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. Any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and/or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, which May Affect our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; global economic fluctuations; variations in our quarterly operating results; variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast; announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations or introduction of new products; government regulations; developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or political, economic or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Recent volatility in the price of our Common Stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies become the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. Risk Associated With Our Interest Rate Swap Agreement We aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations. To minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million. We entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate. If 6-month LIBOR based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings. However, a rise in 6-month LIBOR based interest rates above approximately 5 % per annum in future periods could result in incremental levels of interest expense. The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the ""Rights Plan"") in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals. Our Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects. Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with ""interested stockholders"", as defined by that statute. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. Additionally, from time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In September 1999, Tegal Corporation sued us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents Tegal holds. Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLeä and Exelanâ products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may fail to prevail in this litigation. However, we believe that the Tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial position. See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Tegal lawsuit. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations at June 30, 2002, and June 24, 2001: June 30, June 24, 2002 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------- THERE- FAIR 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 AFTER TOTAL VALUE TOTAL --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- ($ in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate............. $145,700 -- -- -- -- -- $145,700 $145,700 $175,000 Average rate............. 1.87% -- -- -- -- -- 1.87% -- 4.03% Short-term investments Fixed rate............. $368,469 $130,756 -- -- -- -- $499,225 $499,225 $505,050 Average rate............. 4.32% 3.27% -- -- -- -- 4.04% -- 4.94% Auction rate preferreds Variable rate.......... $202,549 -- -- -- -- -- $202,549 $202,549 $137,850 Average rate............. 2.13% -- -- -- -- -- 2.13% -- 4.36% Restricted cash Fixed rate ............ $60,433 $10,550 -- -- -- -- $70,983 $70,983 $60,800 Average rate............. 2.36% 3.41% -- -- -- -- 2.52% -- 4.79% --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- Total investment Securities............. $777,151 $141,306 -- -- -- -- $918,457 $918,457 $878,700 --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- Average rate............. 3.14% 3.28% -- -- -- -- 3.15% -- 4.66% --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- Long-term debt Fixed rate............. $310,260 -- -- 300,000 -- -- $610,260 $566,010 $618,936 Average rate............. 5.00% -- -- 4.00% -- -- 4.51% -- 4.45% Variable rate.......... -- $48,535 -- -- -- -- $48,535 $48,535 $49,263 Average rate............. -- 2.60% -- -- -- -- 2.61% -- 1.81% --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- Total long-term Debt $310,260 $48,535 -- $300,000 -- -- $658,795 $614,545 $668,199 --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- Average rate............. 5.00% 2.60% -- 4.00% -- -- 4.37% -- 4.26% --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- We mitigate default risk by targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate $309.8 million and $300.0 million Convertible Subordinated Notes. However, we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our ¥6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) Yen-denominated bank term loan because the lending rates under that term loan vary with TIBOR. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Yen-denominated assets. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are adjusted to fair value and recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $48.3 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $0.8 million. A 15% appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized loss of $8.5 million, while depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $6.4 million. On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as balance sheet hedges was $13.7 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $8.6 thousand. A 15% appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized gain of $2.4 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized loss of $1.8 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300.0 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Company's 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate. At June 30, 2002, the fair value of the swap, $3.2 million, is recorded in Other Long-Term Assets. An increase in rates by 1% would result in an incremental loss of $9.9 million. A decrease in rates by 1% would result in an incremental gain of $10.3 million. During fiscal 1999, we entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock, in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the $309.8 million 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due September 2, 2002. As of June 30, 2002, we acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock. The weighted-average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the Notes, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share. On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired. As of June 30, 2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $9.32 per share. See ""Subsequent Events"" included herein Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for information concerning the repayment of our 5% Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and the settlement of our equity derivatives. Below is a table showing, at assumed exercise prices for the put and call options and market prices for our Common Stock, our anticipated gain or (loss) under the put and call options upon exercise or upon maturity of the options transaction.

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2016,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2016 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2016 Form 10-K).Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2016 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including mobile phones, computers, tablets, wearables, automotive features, storage devices, and networking equipment.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 32Table of Contents Our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster, and more powerful devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. The process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps, and our product offerings in deposition, etch, and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and/or productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards.The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand. This cyclicality has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among our customers. With a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans lead to changes in demand for Lam’s equipment and services. The variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.During the most recent fiscal year, demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers, particularly non volatile memory customers, made capacity and technology investments. Technology inflections in our industry, including 3DNAND, multiple patterning, FINFET and advanced packaging have led to an increase in our served addressable market for our deposition and etch products. We believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.In October 2015, as further described in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire KLA-Tencor Corporation.The following summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014 FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages)Revenue$5,885,893 $5,259,312 $4,607,309 $626,581 11.9% $652,003 14.2%Gross margin$2,618,922 $2,284,336 $2,007,481 $334,586 14.6% $276,855 13.8%Gross margin as a percent of total revenue44.5% 43.4% 43.6% 1.1% (0.2)% Total operating expenses$1,544,666 $1,496,297 $1,329,812 $48,369 3.2% $166,485 12.5%Net income$914,049 $655,577 $632,289 $258,472 39.4% $23,288 3.7%Net income per diluted share$5.22 $3.70 $3.62 $1.52 41.1% $0.08 2.2%Fiscal year 2016 revenues increased 12% compared to fiscal year 2015, reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 1.1%, which was primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix.Fiscal year 2015 revenues increased 14% compared to fiscal year 2014, reflecting the steady increase in spending on technology inflections. The small decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes.Operating expenses in fiscal year 2016 increased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development and increased employee headcount. Fiscal year 2016 also included KLA-Tencor acquisition related costs.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 33Table of Contents Operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily as a result of continued investments in the next-generation research and development. In fiscal year 2015, we also recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately $79 million related to our single-wafer clean reporting unit.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $7.1 billion as of June 26, 2016 compared to $4.2 billion as of June 28, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of approximately $2.4 billion proceeds from June 2016 senior notes issuance, net of related issuance costs combined with cash flow provided from operating activities. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $786 million for fiscal year 2015. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2016 was primarily used for $451.5 million of principal payments on debt instruments, $158.4 million in treasury stock purchases, $190.4 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $175.3 million of capital expenditures, and are partially offset by $59.4 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Results of OperationsShipments and BacklogShipments for fiscal year 2016 were approximately $5.9 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal year 2015. Shipments for fiscal year 2015 were approximately $5.5 billion, an increase of 20% compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in shipments during the fiscal year 2016 as compared to the last two fiscal years is related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance time lines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance was $566 million as of June 26, 2016 compared to $518 million as of June 28, 2015. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $132 million as of June 26, 2016 compared to $164 million as of June 28, 2015.Gross Margin Year Ended June 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14 (in thousands, except percentages)Gross margin$2,618,922 $2,284,336 $2,007,481 $334,586 14.6% $276,855 13.8%Percent of total revenue44.5% 43.4% 43.6% 1.1% (0.2)% The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to a more favorable customer mix and product mix. Additionally, there was a $10 million impairment charge of a long lived asset in fiscal year 2015.The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 35Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14 (in thousands, except percentages)Research & development (“R&D”)$913,712 $825,242 $716,471 $88,470 10.7% $108,771 15.2%Percent of total revenue15.5% 15.7% 15.6% (0.2)% 0.1% We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a $36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount, a $14 million increase in facility and information technology related spending, a $14 million increase in supplies, a $12 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance, and an $8 million increase in costs associated with campus consolidation.The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a $71 million increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation, a $12 million increase in supplies, a $5 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance, and a $6 million increase in outside services.Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14 (in thousands, except percentages)Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”)$630,954 $591,611 $613,341 $39,343 6.7% $(21,730) (3.5)%Percent of total revenue10.7% 11.2% 13.3% (0.5)% (2.1)% The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to $51 million of KLA-Tencor acquisition related costs and a $3 million increase in restructuring charges. This increase was offset by a $15 million gain on sale of assets net of associated exit costs.The decrease in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a decrease of $11 million in integration costs, a $9 million decrease in costs associated with rationalization of product configurations, and an $8 million decrease related to impairment of long lived assets. This decrease was offset by an $8 million increase in compensation and benefits expense.Goodwill ImpairmentOur annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a non-cash impairment charge upon our single-wafer clean reporting unit of $79 million, extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit. Uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance. There were no impairment charges in fiscal year 2016 or 2014.Gain on Sale of Real EstateDuring fiscal year 2014, we sold our interest in nonessential property in Palo Alto, California, resulting in $135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of $83 million from the transaction.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 36Table of Contents Other Expense, NetOther expense, net, consisted of the following: Year EndedJune 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014 (in thousands)Interest income$29,512 $19,268 $12,540Interest expense(134,773) (73,682) (61,692)(Losses) gains on deferred compensation plan related assets, net(3,995) 9,071 9,559Foreign exchange gains (losses), net308 2,331 1,529Other, net(5,191) (4,177) 668 $(114,139) $(47,189) $(37,396)Interest income increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2015 and 2014, primarily as a result of higher cash and investment balances, as well as improvement to yield. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the $1 billion Senior Note issuance in March 2015, combined with the note issuance cost amortization related to our KLA-Tencor acquisition bridge financing facility. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 as compared with fiscal years 2014 was primarily due to the $1 billion Senior Note issuance in the March 2015 quarter.Foreign exchange gains in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. The loss on deferred compensation plan related assets, net in fiscal year 2016, as compared to similar gains in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, was driven by decline in the fair market value of the underlying funds at year end. Other, net expense realized during fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to commitment fees related to our revolving loan and term loan commitments. Other, net expense realized during fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a settlement of matters relating to certain investment transactions. Other, net income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment. Income Tax Expense (benefit) Year EndedJune 26,2016 June 28,2015 June 29,2014 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$46,068 $85,273 $91,074Effective tax rate4.8% 11.5% 12.6%The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the Altera court ruling (discussed in more detail below), higher income in lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit due to a retroactive and permanent extension of federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2016.The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 due to a retroactive reinstatement of the second half of fiscal year 2014 federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2015.In July 2015, the United States Tax Court (the “Court”) issued an opinion favorable to Altera Corporation (“Altera”) with respect to Altera’s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The litigation relates to the Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 37Table of Contents treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement with Altera’s foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. However, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have evaluated the opinion and have recorded a tax benefit of $87.7 million related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. We have also recorded a tax benefit of $11.2 million related to stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we have recorded a tax liability of $73.6 million for the U.S. tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that we have the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings. We will continue to monitor this matter and related potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. Please refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $465 million and $311 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $429 million and $318 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $102 million and $86 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to an increase related to tax credit carryforwards, recognition of a prepaid cost sharing deferred tax benefit related to the Altera case ruling and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to amortization of intangible assets offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation of tangible assets, convertible debt accretion and an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2016.As of our fiscal year end of June 26, 2016 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in California. We also recorded a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits and continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses. The valuation allowances were $102 million and $86 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 38Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from multiple-element arrangements, which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of equity based compensation expense, including forfeiture estimates, which impacts both gross margin and operating expenses;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and•the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 39Table of Contents Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain a general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Equity-based Compensation: Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”), excluding market-based performance RSUs, based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. We estimate the fair value of our market-based performance RSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate, if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 40Table of Contents flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.As a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.For other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 of this report.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesTotal gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016 compared to $4.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015. This increase was primarily the result of approximately $2.4 billion net proceeds from the June 2016 debt issuances. Approximately $3.1 billion and $2.2 billion of our total cash and investments as June 26, 2016 and June 28, 2015, respectively, was held outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which is held in U.S. dollars and, substantially all of which would be subject to tax at U.S. rates if it were to be repatriated. Refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the United States.Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2016 consisted of (in millions):Net income$914.0Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization291.0Equity-based compensation expense142.3Deferred income taxes(49.0)Amortization of note discounts and issuance costs70.5Changes in operating asset and liability accounts(52.2)Gain on sale of assets(15.2)Other48.9 $1,350.3Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 41Table of Contents Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $169.0 million, inventories of $66.4 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $46.7 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $41.6 million, deferred profit of $27.1 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $161.1 million.Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2016 was $592.5 million, which was primarily due to net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities of $798.8 million, and proceeds on sale of assets of $79.7 million, off-set by net transfers to restricted cash and investments of $112.4 million and capital expenditures of $175.3 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016 was $1,595.7 million, which was primarily due to $2,338.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by $451.5 million of principal payments related primarily to the maturity of $450.0 million of convertible notes in the June quarter, $158.4 million in treasury stock repurchases and $190.4 million of dividends paid to stockholders.LiquidityGiven the historical cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and investments at June 26, 2016 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances inthe United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 42Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not.

See Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Convertible Notes and associated conversion features.(2)Certain tax-related liabilities and post retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are included in the more than 5 years category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. Additionally the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities.Operating LeasesWe lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $249.9 million. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Capital LeasesCapital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories.

Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.Long-Term DebtIn May 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) at par. At the same time, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) at par. We pay cash interest on the 2018 Notes at an annual rate of 1.25%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2016 Notes matured in May 2016. Until their maturity in May 2016, we paid cash interest on the 2016 Notes at an annual rate of 0.5% on a semi-annual basis. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2016 Notes and 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2016 Notes and the 2018 Notes.In connection with the maturity of the 2016 Notes, we paid approximately $451.6 million in settlement of the 2016 Notes. We did not issue any shares of our Common Stock in respect of the 2016 Notes on a net basis as a result of our exercise of the convertible note hedge we purchased concurrently with the issuance of the 2016 Notes. The maturity of the 2016 Notes did not affect the warrants sold concurrently with the issuance of the 2016 Notes and those warrants remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.The 2018 Notes may be converted into our Common Stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 16.3354 shares of our Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $61.22 per share of our Common Stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events, including dividends on our Common Stock. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2018 the Notes.In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the ""2041 Notes""). We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock based on a conversion rate of 29.3158 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $34.11 per share of Common Stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain events, including dividends on our Common Stock.During the quarter-ended June 26, 2016, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2018 Notes and 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2018 Notes and the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2016. On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.We may redeem the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes and before December 15, 2024, for the 2025 Notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after February 15, 2020 for the 2020 Notes and on or after December 24, 2024 for the 2025 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.On June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021 (the ""2021 Notes""), $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2023 (the ""2023 Notes"") and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the ""2026 Notes"" together with the 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 44Table of Contents collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). We will pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80%, 3.45% and 3.90%, respectively, on the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes and 2026 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2016.We may redeem the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before May 15, 2021, for the 2021 Notes, before April 15, 2023 for the 2023 Notes, and before March 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes. We may redeem the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, on or after April 15, 2023 for the 2023 Notes, and on or after March 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes and 2026 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.In the event (i) the proposed merger with KLA-Tencor is not completed on or prior to December 30, 2016 or (ii) the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of October 20, 2015, by and among us, KLA-Tencor, Topeka Merger Sub 1, Inc., and Topeka Merger Sub 3, Inc. (as assignee of Topeka Merger Sub 2, Inc.), is terminated on or at any time prior to such date (each such event referred to as a “Special Mandatory Redemption Event”), we will be required to redeem all of the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes then outstanding, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of initial issuance, or the most recent interest payment date on which interest was paid, whichever is later, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). The 2021 Notes are not subject to this special mandatory redemption. The “Special Mandatory Redemption Date” means the date specified in the notice of special mandatory redemption to be delivered to the holders of the notes no later than five business days following the Special Mandatory Redemption Event, which Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall be three business days after such notice is mailed.During fiscal year 2016, 2015, and 2014, we made $451.5 million, $1.5 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases.Term Loan AgreementOn May 13, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement”), which amends and restates the Term Loan Agreement we entered into on November 10, 2015 with a syndicate of lenders. The Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement provides for a $1,530 million senior unsecured term loan facility composed of two tranches; (i) a $1,005 million tranche of 3-year senior unsecured loans (the ""3-Year Tranche"") maturing on the 3-year anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition of KLA-Tencor subject to several conditions; and (ii) a $525.0 million tranche of 5-year senior unsecured loans (the ""5-Year Tranche"") maturing on the 5-year anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition of KLA-Tencor subject to several conditions. The Amended and Restated Term Loan will terminate on October 20, 2016 if the merger has not been consummated by such date.Interest on amounts borrowed under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% for the 3-Year Tranche or 0.125% to 1.000% for the 5-Year Tranche or (ii) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus a spread of 1.000% to 1.750% for the 3-Year Tranche or 1.125% to 2.000% for the 5-Year Tranche, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of the our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable in equal quarterly amounts as set forth in the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, with any remaining balance due and accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. The Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain (i) a consolidated debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 0.50 to 1.00 (the “Capitalization Covenant”), provided that, until and including the earlier of (x) the end of the first two consecutive full fiscal quarters following the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement's closing date that we are in compliance with the Capitalization Covenant and (y) December 31, 2017, if we are not in compliance with the Capitalization Covenant, we will be deemed not to have violated the Capitalization Covenant so long as our Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 45Table of Contents consolidated debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00 for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) liquidity of no less than $1.0 billion, in each case determined in accordance with the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement. The funding of the loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement will be on the closing date of the acquisition of KLA-Tencor subject to several conditions.Revolving Credit ArrangementsOn November 10, 2015, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (as amended on April 26, 2016, by Amendment No.1 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and as further amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amends and restates our prior unsecured Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2014 (as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated March 5, 2015). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for an increase to our revolving unsecured credit facility, from $300.0 million to $750.0 million with a syndicate of lenders. It includes an expansion option, subject to certain requirements, for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $250.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.0 billion. Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility matures on November 10, 2020.Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (ii) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default that are substantially similar to those in the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement. As of June 26, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants.Debt CommitmentOn October 20, 2015, we obtained a commitment for $4.2 billion of bridge financing from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (“the Commitment Parties”) to finance, in part, the acquisition of KLA-Tencor. The Commitment Parties' commitment to provide financing (the “Bridge Facility”) was subject to certain conditions, including consummation of the merger with KLA-Tencor. On November 10, 2015, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement for $0.9 billion and the Bridge Facility was reduced to $3.3 billion, correspondingly, both with a syndicate of lenders. Following the execution of our June 2016 debt offering and other available credit modifications (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), this commitment was terminated during the three months ended June 26, 2016.Other GuaranteesWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 26, 2016, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 26, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $12.1 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 46Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 26, 2016, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the Convertible Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses.We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on Japanese yen-denominated revenues and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses. To protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 26, 2016 are shown in the table below.

Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based on market conditions, and for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into a series of interest rate contracts with a total notional value of $400.0 million where we received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates. Such interest rate swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt instrument.The following table shows the change in fair value of these fair value hedges, assuming a hypothetical benchmark interest rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 BPS and plus-or-minus 15 BPS.

We manage our interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forward starting interest rate swap agreements. Forward-starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the Company’s anticipated debt issuances, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into and settled a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $600.0 million, associated with our June 2016 debt offering. Such forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the June 2016 debt issuances.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2016 10-K 50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:36.920049

We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive devices, storage devices, and networking equipment. Our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM memory, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from the Cloud, IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3D scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.During the most recent fiscal year, demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers made technology and capacity investments. Over the longer term, we believe that our technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning process flow, and advanced packaging/chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean. While there could be variability in the near-term, we believe that demand for our products and services will increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we target to gain market share.We acquired the outstanding shares of Coventor, Inc. (“Coventor”), a privately-held company, on August 28, 2017, as further discussed in Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K.

The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue. Fiscal year 2017 gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal year 2016 improved primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 increased as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily as a result of higher employee headcount and increased investment in research and development.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $5.2 billion as of June 24, 2018, compared to $6.3 billion as of June 25, 2017. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2018 compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal year 2017. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2018 was primarily used for $2.7 billion in treasury stock purchases, $396 million in net principal payments on debt, $308 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $273 million of capital expenditures and are partially offset by $85 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Results of OperationsShipments and BacklogShipments for fiscal year 2018 were approximately $11.2 billion, an increase of 30% compared to fiscal year 2017. Shipments for fiscal year 2017 were approximately $8.6 billion, an increase of 46% compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in shipments during the fiscal year 2018 as compared to the last two fiscal years is related to stronger customer demand.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 34Table of Contents Year EndedJune 24,2018 June 25,2017 June 26,2016Shipments (in millions)$11,176 $8,586 $5,901Korea33% 32% 17%Japan19% 15% 16%China16% 13% 20%Taiwan13% 24% 25%United States7% 8% 8%Southeast Asia7% 4% 11%Europe5% 4% 3%The percentage of total Lam semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016.

As noted in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K, the adoption of accounting standard update 2014-09 is expected to result in a net decrease, estimated between $100 million and $200 million, to our total current liabilities balance, affecting our deferred revenue, deferred costs and resulting deferred profit recognition. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $607 million as of June 24, 2018, compared to $397 million as of June 25, 2017.Gross Margin Year Ended ChangeJune 24,2018 June 25,2017 June 26,2016FY18 vs. FY17 FY17 vs. FY16 (in thousands, except percentages)Gross margin$5,165,032 $3,603,359 $2,618,922 $1,561,673 43.3% $984,437 37.6%Percent of revenue46.6% 45.0% 44.5% 1.6% 0.5%The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue.

The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the conversions of 2018 and 2041 Convertible Notes as well as the retirement of the 2018 Convertible Notes in May 2018. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of the 2016 Convertible Notes.The gain on deferred compensation plan related assets, in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, compared to a loss in fiscal year 2016 was driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 37Table of Contents The loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.Loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of certain senior notes issued, as well as the termination of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement following the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with KLA-Tencor.Income Tax Expense As discussed in Note 6, “Income Taxes,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K, the “Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” (hereafter referred to as “U.S. tax reform”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and was effective starting in our quarter ended December 24, 2017. U.S. tax reform reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, mandates payment of a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which allows for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As such, there is significant activity in the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, which reflects the change in legislation. Most of that activity has provisionally been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period ended June 24, 2018, as we have not yet completed all of the accounting for the tax effects of enactment. We recorded what we believe to be a reasonable estimate and the provisional activity is subject to further adjustments under SAB 118, with the exception of revaluation of our deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. federal statutory tax rate, which is considered final and complete under SAB 118. In addition, for significant items for which we could not make a reasonable estimate, no provisional activity was recorded. We will continue to refine the provisional balances and adjustments may be made under SAB 118 during the measurement period as a result of future changes in interpretation, information available, assumptions made by the Company and/or issuance of additional guidance; these adjustments could be material.The below discussion around the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are significantly impacted by U.S. tax reform.Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year Ended ChangeJune 24,2018 June 25,2017 June 26,2016FY18 vs. FY17 FY17 vs. FY16 (in thousands, except percentages) Income tax expense$771,108 $113,910 $46,068 $657,198 576.9% $67,842 147.3%Effective tax rate24.5% 6.3% 4.8% 18.2% 1.5%The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings.The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the change in the mix of income offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion favorable to Altera Corporation (“Altera”) with respect to Altera’s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The litigation related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with Altera’s foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the U.S. Tax Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In July 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court. In August 2018, the opinion made by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was withdrawn to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer on the appeal. We are currently Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 38Table of Contents evaluating the impact, if any, of these subsequent events on our fiscal year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. We are unable to estimate the impact at this time.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. Additionally, the impact of U.S. tax reform is being evaluated for how it will affect future years’ tax expense due to tax reform provisions that we will be subject to beginning in fiscal year 2019. Tax reform provisions being evaluated impacting future years include “Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income” (“GILTI”) and other provisions. Please refer to Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $437 million and $546 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $169 million and $585 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $200 million and $114 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2018 and 2017 is primarily due to deferred revaluation to reflect the new U.S. statutory tax rate and decreases related to allowances and reserves, prepaid cost sharing, and unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.As of our fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in California. The valuation allowances were $200 million and $114 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from multiple-element arrangements, which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of equity-based compensation expense, including forfeiture estimates, which impacts both gross margin and operating expenses;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; andContinues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 39Table of Contents •the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Equity-based Compensation: Employee Stock Plans: We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”), excluding market-based performance RSUs, based upon the fair market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. We estimate the fair value of our market-based performance RSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate, if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 40Table of Contents realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determined that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. Likewise, if we later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.As a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our Common Stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.For other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.

Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2018 was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net sale and maturities of available-for-sale securities of $3.2 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures of $273 million and business acquisitions of $116 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2018 was $3.3 billion, primarily consisting of $2.7 billion in Common Stock repurchases, $756 million of cash paid for debt extinguishment, and $308 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $360 million of net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, and $85 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 24, 2018, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 42Table of Contents credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 24, 2018, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.The amounts in the table below exclude $280 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion. The amounts in the table below also exclude $14 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.

The principal balances of the 2041 Notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion features.(2)Value represented is provisional in nature and subject to future measurement period adjustments under SAB 118. We may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment. (3)Certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are included in the “More than 5 Years” category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities.Operating LeasesWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 43Table of Contents Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion.Capital LeasesCapital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2018, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.Income TaxesDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. This value is identified as provisional in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended June 24, 2018, and is subject to future measurement period adjustments under SAB 118. Such an adjustment was made during the June 2018 quarter, incorporating new information into the estimate; we may make further adjustments as new information is made available. The revised estimate is now $883 million. The one-time transition tax may be elected to be paid over a period of eight years. The Company intends to make this election, and anticipates 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.Long-Term DebtIn May 2011, we issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) at par. The 2018 Notes matured in May 2018. Concurrent with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2018 Notes. During the twelve months ended June 24, 2018 we paid approximately $448 million in settlement of the 2018 Notes. We did not issue any shares of our Common Stock in respect of the 2018 Notes on a net basis as a result of our exercise of the convertible note hedge we purchased concurrently with the issuance of the 2018 Notes. The maturity of the 2018 Notes did not affect the warrants sold concurrent with the issuance of the 2018 Notes and those warrants remain outstanding, with contractual expirations ranging from August 15 to October 24, 2018.In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock. During the quarter-ended June 24, 2018, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2018. On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 44Table of Contents March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.We may redeem the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes and before December 15, 2024, for the 2025 Notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at any time on or after February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes and on or after December 24, 2024, for the 2025 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.On June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”), together with the 2020 Notes, and 2021 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 Notes on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.We may redeem the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the respective indenture, and accrued and unpaid interest before May 15, 2021. We may redeem the 2021 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after May 15, 2021. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2021 Notes, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.During fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, we made $753 million, $1.7 billion, and $451 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases.Revolving Credit ArrangementsOn October 13, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2nd Amendment”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, which amends the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 10, 2015, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2016, among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as further amended by the 2nd Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). Among other things, the Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million increase to the Company’s revolving credit facility, from $750 million under the Credit Agreement to $1.25 billion under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also modifies the date of maturity of the revolving credit facility from November 10, 2020 to October 13, 2022. The Amended Credit Agreement provides an expansion option, that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. Other than as disclosed in this paragraph, the material terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the Credit Agreement.Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 24, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 45Table of Contents Commercial Paper ProgramOn November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (“the CP Program”) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. Individual maturities may vary, but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time and under our stock repurchase program. If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by our Revolving Credit Arrangement.Other GuaranteesWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2018, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 24, 2018, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $22 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 46Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 24, 2018, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed-income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2018,were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Valueas of Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points June 24, 2018 (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) —% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands)Municipal notes and bonds153,974 153,365 152,750 152,136 151,521 150,906 150,292U.S. Treasury and agencies357,056 356,874 356,692 356,509 356,327 356,145 355,963Government-sponsored enterprises111,104 110,990 110,876 110,762 110,648 110,534 110,420Foreign government bonds19,999 19,995 19,990 19,985 19,981 19,976 19,971Bank and corporate notes518,765 517,798 516,832 515,866 514,899 513,933 512,967Mortgage backed securities - residential849 833 817 801 785 770 754Total$1,161,747 $1,159,855 $1,157,957 $1,156,059 $1,154,161 $1,152,264 $1,150,367We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 47Table of Contents Long-Term DebtAs of June 24, 2018, we had $2.1 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $3.5 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the 2041 Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and Japanese yen notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items.

Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based on market conditions, and for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into a series of interest rate contracts with a total notional value of $400 million where we received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates. Such interest rate swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt instrument.The following table shows the change in fair value of these fair value hedges, assuming a hypothetical benchmark interest rate movement of plus or minus 10 BPS and plus or minus 15 BPS.

We manage our interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. Forward-starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the Company’s anticipated debt issuances, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into and settled a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $600 million, associated with our June 2016 debt offering. Such forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the June 2016 debt issuances.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2018 10-K 50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:33.955372

This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers or sanctions may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. In addition, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins. Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit our markets and impact our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of anticipated growth for our business.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and Korean won. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 21Table of Contents The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.Certain Critical Information Systems, That We Rely on for the Operation of Our Business and Products That We Sell, Are Susceptible to Cybersecurity and Other Threats or IncidentsWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include but are not limited to, telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications, and email. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and Cloud providers. In addition, we make use of Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers, or third-party networks and servers, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the Internet for their function. All of these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from various sources, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment.We have experienced cyber threats and incidents in the past. Although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cyber threats or incidents in the future. If we were subject to a cyber incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such adverse effects might include:•Loss of (or inability to access, e.g. through ransomware) confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems;•The disruption of the proper function of our products, services and/or operations;•The failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes;•Errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work;•The loss or public exposure of the personal information of our employees, customers or other parties;•The public release of customer orders, financial and business plans, and operational results;•Exposure to claims from third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents; •Misappropriation or theft of our or a customer, supplier or other party's assets or resources, and costs associated therewith;•Diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; or•Our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax information and other required communications.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 22Table of Contents While we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on, those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cyber-related incidents.Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 23Table of Contents The Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:•general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products;•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or•dilutive impacts of our Convertible Notes.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 24Table of Contents systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 25Table of Contents Item 2.PropertiesOur executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and Villach, Austria. The majority of the Fremont and Livermore facilities are held under operating leases expiring in 2020 and 2021. The Villach facilities are held under capital leases expiring in calendar year 2021. Our Fremont, Livermore, and Villach leases include options to renew or purchase the facilities. In addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support, and sales personnel throughout the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in Ohio and Korea. The Company owns two properties in Fremont, as well as the majority of the Tualatin facilities. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsWhile we are not currently party to any legal proceedings that we believe are material, we are either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property claims. We accrue for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. These accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the effects of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, we believe that the amount of any such additional loss would be immaterial to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Item 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStock InformationOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select MarketSM under the symbol “LRCX.” As of August 15, 2019, we had 401 stockholders of record. DividendsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2019, our quarterly dividend was $1.10 per share. Repurchase of Company SharesIn November 2018, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this share repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 30, 2019, we have purchased approximately $2.0 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.5 billion via open market trading and $1.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the ""June 2019 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2019 ASR is anticipated to occur no later than November 20, 2019.On January 31, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the ""January 2019 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $760 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.3 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on January 30, 2019. The total number of shares received under the January 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during May 2019, resulted in the receipt of approximately 0.8 million additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $182.32 for the transaction period.

During the quarter ended June 24, 2018, $116 million of this provisional charge was reversed.Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2019 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2019 Form 10-K.)Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 31Table of Contents Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from the Cloud, IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3D scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.Despite recent semiconductor capital investment volatility, over the longer term, we believe that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean. While there could be continued variability in the near-term, we believe that demand for our products and services will increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and as we gain market share.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 32Table of Contents The following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended ChangeJune 30, 2019 June 24, 2018 June 25, 2017 FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages)Revenue$9,653,559 $11,076,998 $8,013,620 $(1,423,439) (12.9)% $3,063,378 38.2%Gross margin$4,358,459 $5,165,032 $3,603,359 $(806,573) (15.6)% $1,561,673 43.3%Gross margin as a percent of total revenue45.1% 46.6% 45.0% (1.5)% 1.6%Total operating expenses$1,893,727 $1,951,733 $1,701,227 $(58,006) (3.0)% $250,506 14.7%Net income$2,191,430 $2,380,681 $1,697,763 $(189,251) (7.9)% $682,918 40.2%Net income per diluted share$13.70 $13.17 $9.24 $0.53 4.0 % $3.93 42.5%Fiscal year 2019 revenue decreased 13% compared to fiscal year 2018, reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower factory utilization. The decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by restructuring charges.Fiscal year 2018 revenue increased 38% compared to fiscal year 2017, reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 increased as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily as a result of higher employee headcount and increased investment in research and development.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2019, compared to $5.2 billion as of June 24, 2018. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2019 compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2018. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2019 was primarily used for $3.8 billion in treasury stock purchases, $678 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $303 million of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $2.0 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and $85 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 33Table of Contents Results of OperationsRevenue Year EndedJune 30, 2019 June 24, 2018 June 25, 2017Revenue (in millions)$9,654 $11,077 $8,014Korea23% 35% 31%China22% 16% 13%Japan20% 17% 13%Taiwan17% 13% 26%United States8% 7% 8%Southeast Asia6% 7% 5%Europe4% 5% 4%Revenue decreased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, but increased compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of the volatility of semiconductor capital investments by our customers. The overall Asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance was $449 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $994 million as of June 24, 2018. The deferred revenue at the end of June 2019 is recognized under Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 606, while the same values as of June 2018 are recognized under ASC 605, which contributes to the change in value period over period. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to customers in Japan was approximately $78 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $607 million as of June 24, 2018.The percentage of total Lam semiconductor systems revenue to each of the markets we serve was as follows for fiscal year 2019: Year EndedJune 30, 2019Memory70%Foundry20%Logic/integrated device manufacturing10%Gross Margin Year Ended ChangeJune 30, 2019 June 24, 2018 June 25, 2017FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17 (in thousands, except percentages)Gross margin$4,358,459 $5,165,032 $3,603,359 $(806,573) (15.6)% $1,561,673 43.3%Percent of revenue45.1% 46.6% 45.0% (1.5)% 1.6%The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to lower factory utilization.The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 34Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended ChangeJune 30, 2019 June 24, 2018 June 25, 2017FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17 (in thousands, except percentages)Research & development$1,191,320 $1,189,514 $1,033,742 $1,806 0.2% $155,772 15.1%Percent of revenue12.3% 10.7% 12.9% 1.6% (2.2)%We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes.

Interest expense in the year ended June 30, 2019, increased compared to the year ended June 24, 2018, primarily due to issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the conversions of 2018 and 2041 Convertible Notes as well as the retirement of the 2018 Convertible Notes in May 2018. The gain on deferred compensation plan related assets in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.The loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.Loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of certain senior notes issued, as well as the termination of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement following the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with KLA-Tencor.Income Tax Expense As discussed in Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K, the “Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” (hereafter referred to as “U.S. tax reform”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and was effective starting in our quarter ended December 24, 2017. U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. We recorded what we believed to be reasonable estimates during the SAB 118 measurement period. During the December 2018 quarter, we finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. Although the SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of U.S. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of U.S. Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 36Table of Contents tax reform. We may need to adjust our previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of our tax accounting positions in accordance with ASC 740; such adjustments could be material.The below discussion around the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are significantly impacted by U.S. tax reform.Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year Ended ChangeJune 30, 2019 June 24, 2018 June 25, 2017FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$255,141 $771,108 $113,910 $(515,967) (66.9)% $657,198 576.9%Effective tax rate10.4% 24.5% 6.3% (14.1)% 18.2%The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due tothe impact of U.S. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018.The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings.In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion favorable to Altera Corporation (“Altera”) with respect to Altera’s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The litigation related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with Altera’s foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the U.S. Tax Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”), through a three-judge panel, reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court. Altera has petitioned the Ninth Circuit for an en banc rehearing of a larger panel of eleven Ninth Circuit judges. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of this litigation on our fiscal year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimated potential impact is in the range of $75 million, which may result in a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. Due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provision described in Note 7 - Income Taxes, international pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $471 million and $437 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $160 million and $169 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $227 million and $200 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the gross deferred tax assets and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to increases in tax carryforwards.As of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California. The valuation allowances were $227 million and $200 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 37Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and•the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: On June 25, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (ASC 606) - Revenue From Contracts with Customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry specific guidance. We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.Identify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 38Table of Contents Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 39Table of Contents The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.As a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our Common Stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.For other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.

This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 40Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $3.2 billion during fiscal year 2019 consisted of (in millions):Net income$2,191Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization309Equity-based compensation expense187Deferred income taxes(5)Amortization of note discounts and issuance costs7Changes in operating asset and liability accounts492Other(5) $3,176Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in accounts receivable of $732 million and inventories of $281 million; partially offset by uses of cash: decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $195 million, deferred profit of $178 million, accounts payable of $131 million, and prepaid assets of $18 million.Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2019 was $1.6 billion, primarily consisting of net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.3 billion, along with capital expenditures of $303 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2019 was $2.4 billion, primarily consisting of $3.8 billion in Common Stock repurchases, $678 million of dividends paid, $2.0 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt, and $85 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2019, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 41Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2019, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.The amounts in the table below exclude $373 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion. The amounts in the table below also exclude $10 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.

(2)The conversion period for the 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the “2041 Notes”) was open as of June 30, 2019, and as such the net carrying value of the 2041 Notes is included within current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The principal balances of the 2041 Notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion features.(3)We may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment.(4)Certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are included in the “More than 5 Years” category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities.Operating LeasesWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.Capital LeasesCapital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 42Table of Contents Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 30, 2019, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.Income TaxesDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount is $868.4 million. The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.Long-Term DebtIn June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock. During the quarter-ended June 30, 2019, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2019. On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.On June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”), together with the 2020 Notes, and 2021 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 Notes on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.On March 4, 2019, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2049 (the “2049 Notes”, collectively with the 2026 and 2029 Notes, the “Senior Notes issued in 2019”). We will pay interest at an annual rate of 3.75%, 4.00%, and 4.875%, respectively on the 2026, 2029 and 2049 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2019.We may redeem the 2020, 2021, 2025, 2026, 2029 and 2049 Notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes, before May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, before December 15, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, before January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, before December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, and before September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes, on or after May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, on or after December 24, 2024, for the 2025 Notes, on or after January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, on or after December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, and on or after September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 43Table of Contents offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.During fiscal year 2019, 2018, and 2017, we made $117 million, $753 million, and $1.7 billion, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases.Revolving Credit ArrangementsOn March 12, 2014, the Company established an unsecured Credit Agreement. This agreement was amended on November 10, 2015 (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), October 13, 2017 (the “2nd Amendment”), and February 25, 2019 (the “3rd Amendment”). Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2nd and 3rd Amendment), the Company has a revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion with a syndicate of lenders with an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. The facility matures on October 13, 2022. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 30, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants.Commercial Paper ProgramOn November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. Individual maturities may vary, but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program. If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by our Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.Other GuaranteesWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 30, 2019, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2019, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $43 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 44Table of Contents We have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, consistent with our Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 45Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 30, 2019, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target a capital preservation-focused investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed-income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the 2041 Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and Japanese yen notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items.

Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based on market conditions, and for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into a series of interest rate contracts with a total notional value of $400 million where we received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates. Such interest rate swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt instrument.The following table shows the change in fair value of these fair value hedges, assuming a hypothetical benchmark interest rate movement of plus or minus 10 BPS and plus or minus 15 BPS.

We manage our interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. Forward-starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the Company’s anticipated debt issuances, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2016, we entered into and settled a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements associated with our June 2016 debt offering. Such forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the June 2016 debt issuances.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:28.359019

This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, or the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. In addition, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.Certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments. Our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues. We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and Korean won. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 21Table of Contents foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.Our Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China. China represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China represented approximately 31%, 22%, and 16% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. In recent months, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues. Specifically, on June 29, 2020, a new rule enacted by the U.S. Department of Commerce took effect that expands export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses. This rule may require us to apply for additional export licenses for our products to be sold to certain customers in China, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we may apply for on a timely basis or at all. Although we do not currently anticipate a material adverse impact from this rule on our revenues in China, the impact of this rule is uncertain and could change. In addition, our international sales may also be impacted by export licensing requirements applicable to our customers and their products. On August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce expanded a rule originally published on May 19, 2020 in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. This new rule does not impose additional export license requirements on our products, but it has the potential to adversely impact the demand for wafer fabrication equipment with U.S.-origin technology (potentially including many of our products) by customers that may intend to use such equipment to produce wafers, chipsets or certain related items when Huawei or its affiliates are expected to be parties to a transaction involving the items. The implementation, interpretation and impact on our business of these rules is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to That CustomerSemiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 22Table of Contents We Face a Challenging and Complex Competitive EnvironmentWe face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures. Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments. Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. In addition, we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do, allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match. In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 23Table of Contents of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 24Table of Contents protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 25Table of Contents We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per ShareWe have $5.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible notes outstanding. Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.25 billion commercial paper program and our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•risk associated with the alternative reference rate reform (e.g. LIBOR transition);•risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;•a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 26Table of Contents •create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, the Convertible Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesOur executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and Villach, Austria. The majority of the Fremont and Livermore facilities are held under operating leases expiring in December 2020 and May 2021. The Villach facilities are held under finance leases expiring in calendar year 2021. Our Fremont, Livermore, and Villach leases include options to renew or purchase the facilities. In addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support, and sales personnel throughout the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in Ohio and Korea. The Company owns two properties in Fremont, as well as the majority of the Tualatin facilities. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsWhile we are not currently party to any legal proceedings that we believe are material, we are either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property claims. We accrue for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. These accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the effects of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, based on current information, we believe that the amount of any such additional loss would be immaterial to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 27Table of Contents Item 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStock InformationOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select MarketSM under the symbol “LRCX.” As of August 13, 2020, we had 494 stockholders of record. DividendsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2020, our quarterly dividend was $1.15 per share. Repurchase of Company SharesIn November 2018, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, and this authorization was announced on January 23, 2019. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this share repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 28, 2020, we have purchased approximately $3.2 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.7 billion via open market trading and $2.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn November 22, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the ""November 2019 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 2.9 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on November 22, 2019. The total number of shares received under the November 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the November 2019 ASR occurred during March 2020, resulting in the receipt of approximately 705 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $280.27 for the transaction period. On June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the ""June 2019 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during November 2019, resulting in the receipt of approximately 361 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $215.60 for the transaction period.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 29Table of Contents Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchased (1) AveragePrice Paidper Share(2) Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor Programs AmountAvailableUnderRepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 30, 2019 $3,033,500Quarter ended September 29, 2019397 $196.83 383 2,958,304Quarter ended December 29, 20193,242 $265.88 3,224 1,957,829Quarter ended March 29, 20201,576 $281.93 1,239 1,811,432March 30, 2020 - April 26, 20203 $261.24 — 1,811,432April 27, 2020 - May 24, 2020134 $260.59 129 1,777,649May 25, 2020 - June 28, 202019 $267.31 16 1,773,427Total5,371 $261.44 4,991 $1,773,427 (1)During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, we acquired 380 thousand shares at a total cost of $109.6 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2020 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2020 Form 10-K.)Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 33Table of Contents individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from the Cloud, IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3D scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. We have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group focuses attention on delivery solutions that meet our customers’ technical requirements as well as productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.During fiscal year 2020, customer demand remained relatively strong, however we experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted our gross margin. While we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain, which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Over the longer term, while there are risks that the impact of COVID-19 to the broader macroeconomic environment may negatively impact our customer demand, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean.

The decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by restructuring charges.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $7.0 billion as of June 28, 2020, compared to $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2019. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2020 compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2019. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was primarily used for $1.4 billion in treasury stock purchases, $657 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $203 million of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $1.3 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and $94 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Results of OperationsRevenue Year EndedJune 28, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 24, 2018Revenue (in millions)$10,045 $9,654 $11,077China31% 22% 16%Korea24% 23% 35%Taiwan19% 17% 13%Japan9% 20% 17%United States8% 8% 7%Southeast Asia6% 6% 7%Europe3% 4% 5%Revenue increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, but decreased compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of the variability of semiconductor capital investments by our customers.

Interest income increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 as a result of higher yield, offset by a lower cash balance. Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the full-year impact of the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes that occurred in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of $2.0 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020. The increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was also primarily due to the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019.The gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.The loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year Ended ChangeJune 28, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 24, 2018FY20 vs. FY19 FY19 vs. FY18 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$323,225 $255,141 $771,108 $68,084 26.7% $(515,967) (66.9)%Effective tax rate12.6% 10.4% 24.5% 2.2% (14.1)%The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below.The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018.In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by Altera Corporation (“Altera”) in July 2019. In that quarter, we evaluated the impact of the decision Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 37Table of Contents and viewed the denial as an indication that Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. As a result, we reversed $74.5 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 29, 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from our inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. In February 2020, Altera petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States (""SCOTUS"") to hear their case. In June 2020, the SCOTUS denied the petition.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $575 million and $471 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $196 million and $160 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to increases in outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, tax credits, and operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and decreases in prepaid cost sharing.As of our fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California. The valuation allowances were $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; andContinues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 38Table of Contents •the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: On June 25, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (“ASC 606”) - Revenue From Contracts with Customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry specific guidance. We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.Identify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 39Table of Contents those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.As a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our Common Stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 40Table of Contents For other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesTotal gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $7.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared to $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of $2.0 billion of senior notes, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid.Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 billion during fiscal year 2020 consisted of (in thousands):Net income$2,251,753Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization268,525Equity-based compensation expense189,197Deferred income taxes(17,777)Amortization of note discounts and issuance costs5,940Changes in operating asset and liability accounts(571,875)Other688 $2,126,451Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $642 million, inventories of $412 million, and prepaid assets of $14 million; partially offset by sources of cash: increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $211 million, accounts payable of $208 million, and deferred profit of $76 million.Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $244 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $203 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $624 million, primarily consisting of $1.4 billion in Common Stock repurchases, $657 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $1.3 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt, and $94 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 41Table of Contents LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 28, 2020, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases which are outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 28, 2020, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.The amounts in the table below exclude $439 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion. The amounts in the table below also exclude $12 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.

Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities and the long-term portion of operating leases.Operating LeasesWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion.Financing LeasesFinancing leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 28, 2020, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.Income TaxesDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount was $868.4 million. We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.Long-Term DebtOn May 5, 2020, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2050 (the “2050 Notes”), and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2060 (the “2060 Notes”). We will pay interest at an annual rate of 1.90%, 2.875%, and 3.125%, on the 2030, 2050, and 2060 Notes, respectively, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning December 15, 2020.On March 4, 2019, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2049 (the “2049 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.75%, 4.00%, and 4.875%, respectively on the 2026, 2029 and 2049 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.On June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 43Table of Contents March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.80% on the 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year. During the year ended June 28, 2020, $500 million principal value of 2020 Notes were settled upon maturity. We may redeem the 2021, 2025, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2049, 2050, and 2060 Notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, before December 15, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, before January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, before December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, before March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, before September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, before December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and before December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, on or after December 24, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, on or after January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, on or after December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, on or after March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, on or after September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, on or after December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and on or after December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock. We may redeem the 2041 Notes on or after May 21, 2021 at a price equal to outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest if the last reported sales price of common shares has been equal to or more than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption notice date.During the quarter-ended June 28, 2020, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2020. As of June 28, 2020, $48.5 million of the 2041 notes remain outstanding, as a result of cumulative conversion activity.During fiscal year 2020, 2019, and 2018, we made $668 million, $117 million, and $753 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and finance/capital leases.Revolving Credit ArrangementsOn March 12, 2014, the Company established an unsecured Credit Agreement. This agreement was amended on November 10, 2015 (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), October 13, 2017 (the “2nd Amendment”), and February 25, 2019 (the “3rd Amendment”). Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2nd and 3rd Amendment), the Company has a revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion with a syndicate of lenders with an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. The facility matures on October 13, 2022. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 28, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants.LIBOR is currently expected to be discontinued by the end of calendar year 2021. We expect to amend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to that occurrence to provide for an alternative reference interest Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 44Table of Contents rate plus an appropriate spread that approximates the existing reference interest rate as calculated in accordance with LIBOR. Despite the current expectations, we cannot be sure when LIBOR is discontinued, that we will be able to reach an agreement with the administrative agent under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on an alternate reference interest rate plus an appropriate spread, or that changes to the determination of interest under our agreements would approximate the current calculation in accordance with LIBOR. If we should fail to reach agreement with the administrative agent on an alternate reference interest rate prior to such time as LIBOR is unavailable as a reference rate, then the borrowings will bear interest at a base rate determined in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement tied to either the prime rate or federal funds rate, plus a spread.Commercial Paper ProgramOn November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. Individual maturities may vary but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program. If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by our Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 28, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.Other GuaranteesWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 28, 2020, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 28, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $59 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.We have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, consistent with our Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.Continues on next pageLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 45Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 28, 2020, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target a capital preservation-focused investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed-income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS with a minimum interest rate of zero BPS.

The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the 2041 Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and Japanese yen notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items.

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2021,"Item 7. Results of Operation of this 2021 Form 10-K, accounted for approximately 94%, 92%, and 92% of total revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.We are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:•domestic and international trade regulations, policies, practices, relations, disputes and issues;•domestic and international tariffs, export controls and other barriers;•developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources;•global or national economic and political conditions;•changes in currency controls;•differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;•our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;•changes in and compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, environmental, tax, and labor laws;•fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;•the need for technical support resources in different locations; and•our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessarylocations for the successful operation of our business.For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, stay at home orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, or the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. Certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments, and our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues. As is discussed below under the heading “Our Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China,” the U.S. government has recently expanded export license requirements that impact trade with China. In addition, the U.S. government is in the process of assessing which “emerging and foundational” technologies may be subject to new or additional export controls under the 2018 Export Control Reform Act, and it is possible that such controls, if and when imposed, could adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. Furthermore, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 18Table of Contents companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 19Table of Contents of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKSOur Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China. China represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in China, represented approximately 35%, 31%, and 22% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. Recently, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition, and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future. For example, over the course of calendar year 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce enacted a new rule that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses, added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list (including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and related entities), and expanded an existing rule (referred to as the foreign direct product rule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. These rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to specified customers in China, such as SMIC (where those products would not otherwise require an export license to China), and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our customers (including but not limited to Chinese customers) may require U.S. export licenses for the use of our products in order to manufacture products, including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits, for those of their customers (i.e. Huawei and its affiliates) that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. The U.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue. The implementation, interpretation and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory actions or changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.Recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries. In addition, President Joseph Biden has made several corporate income tax proposals, including a significant increase to the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income. If enacted, such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 20Table of Contents We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-boycott compliance, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, antitrust regulations, and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions, as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we do not fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced operating income, and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.Our Bylaws Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Judicial Forum for Certain Legal Actions Between the Company and its Stockholders, Which May Discourage Lawsuits with Respect to Such Claims. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent otherwise, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims (including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit), such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty, claims arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This is a general summary of the bylaw provision; you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details. While the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision, as recent court decisions have held. As a Delaware corporation, Delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs, including duties that our directors, officers, employees, and others owe to the Company and its stockholders. We believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us, and our stockholders, by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs, promoting consistent application of Delaware law in these lawsuits, and reducing the possibility of duplicative, costly, multi-jurisdictional litigation with the potential for Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 21Table of Contents inconsistent outcomes. However, the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than Delaware, and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits.FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKSThe Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:•general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•margin trading, short sales, hedging and derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products; or•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value. We review all other long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets requires significant judgement. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. When evaluating goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. When evaluating other long-lived assets, if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per ShareWe have $5.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.5 billion commercial paper program and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.1 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 22Table of Contents In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•risk associated with the alternative reference rate reform (e.g. LIBOR transition);•risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;•a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;•create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, the Convertible Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesOur executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and Villach, Austria. The majority of the Fremont and Livermore facilities are held under finance leases expiring in September 2027. The Villach facilities are held under finance leases expiring in calendar year 2021. Our Fremont, Livermore, and Villach leases include options to renew or purchase the facilities. In addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support, and sales personnel throughout the United States, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in California, Ohio, Oregon, Austria, Korea and Taiwan. In 2020, we announced the establishment of a new owned advanced technology production facility in Malaysia and the facility began production in July 2021. The Company owns Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 23Table of Contents two properties in Fremont, as well as the majority of the Tualatin facilities. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsPlease refer to the subsection entities “Legal Proceedings” within Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 24Table of Contents PART IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStock InformationOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select MarketSM under the symbol “LRCX.” As of August 12, 2021, we had 476 stockholders of record. DividendsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2021, our quarterly dividend declared was $1.30 per share. Repurchases of Company SharesIn November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock; this authorization supplements the remaining balance from any prior authorization. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn February 11, 2021, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""February 2021 ASR"") with a financial institution to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 655 thousand shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on February 11, 2021. The total number of shares received under the February 2021 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the February 2021 ASR occurred during May 2021, resulting in the receipt of approximately 213 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $575.74 for the transaction period.Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchased (1)AveragePrice Paidper Share(2)Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor ProgramsAmountAvailableUnderRepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 28, 2020$1,773,427 Quarter ended September 27, 20201,359 $343.71 1,344 1,311,429 Quarter ended December 27, 20201,797 $405.00 1,789 5,586,944 Quarter ended March 28, 20211,731 $536.75 1,474 4,661,845 March 29, 2021 - April 25, 20213 $637.73 — 4,661,845 April 26, 2021 - May 23, 2021552 $598.19 547 4,461,850 May 24, 2021 - June 27, 2021377 $639.02 375 4,222,220 Total (3)5,819 $619.80 5,529 $4,222,220 (1)During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2021, we acquired 290 thousand shares at a total cost of $166.4 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2021 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2021 Form 10-K.)Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from the Cloud, IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3D scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. We have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group focuses attention on delivering solutions that meet our customers’ technical requirements and productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.Throughout the 2021 fiscal year, there was an increase in wafer fabrication equipment spending by semiconductor manufacturers, driven by the robust secular demand for semiconductors in a number of markets including high-performance computing, personal computers, and 5G networks. Customer demand was strong, and we continued to increase our production output levels as we operated under COVID-19-related safety protocols. While we have seen improvements in both our own operations and those of our Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 27Table of Contents suppliers, we experienced higher costs of goods sold related to freight and logistics during the year. Risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain, which may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Over the longer term, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will lead to an increase in the served addressable market for our products and services in the deposition, etch, and clean businesses.

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix, partially offset by higher costs incurred in freight and logistics as well as start-up expenses for our new Malaysia manufacturing facility. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount, outsourcing services, deferred compensation plan-related costs, and supplies, partially offset by lower travel expenses and miscellaneous costs. Fiscal year 2020 revenue increased 4% compared to fiscal year 2019, reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by lower factory and field utilization. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services, partially offset by lower travel expense, miscellaneous costs and restructuring charges.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $6.0 billion as of June 27, 2021, compared to $7.0 billion as of June 28, 2020. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2021 compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2020. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2021 was primarily used for $2.7 billion in treasury stock purchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; $862 million of principal payments on debt instruments; $727 million in dividends paid to our stockholders; and $349 million of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $122 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Results of OperationsRevenue Year EndedJune 27,2021June 28,2020June 30,2019Revenue (in millions)$14,626 $10,045 $9,654 China35 %31 %22 %Korea27 %24 %23 %Taiwan14 %19 %17 %Japan9 %9 %20 %United States6 %8 %8 %Southeast Asia6 %6 %6 %Europe3 %3 %4 %Revenue increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal years 2020 and 2019, primarily due to the increased investment by our customers in semiconductor capital equipment as well as higher revenue from our Customer Support Business Group for spares, services, upgrades and mature node equipment.

Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the full-year impact of the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of $2.0 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020.Gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.The gains in other, net for the fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by private equity investments.Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year EndedChangeJune 27,2021June 28,2020June 30,2019FY21 vs. FY20FY20 vs. FY19 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$462,346 $323,225 $255,141 $139,121 43.0 %$68,084 26.7 %Effective tax rate10.6 %12.6 %10.4 %(2.0)%2.2%The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 30Table of Contents The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below.In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by Altera Corporation (“Altera”) in July 2019. In that quarter, we evaluated the impact of the decision and viewed the denial as an indication that Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. As a result, we reversed $75 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 29, 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from our intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In February 2020, Altera petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States (""SCOTUS"") to hear their case. In June 2020, the SCOTUS denied the petition.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $736 million and $575 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $152 million and $196 million and a valuation allowance of $277 million and $245 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2021 and 2020 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, allowances and reserves, and tax credits, and decreases in gross deferred tax liabilities for convertible debt.As of our fiscal year ended June 27, 2021, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California. The valuation allowances were $277 million and $245 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and•the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 31Table of Contents Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.Identify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 32Table of Contents than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.If after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.For other long-lived assets, we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we de-recognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesTotal gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $6.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $7.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. This decrease was primarily due to Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program, dividends paid, and principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities.Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $3.6 billion during fiscal year 2021 consisted of (in thousands):Net income$3,908,458 Non-cash charges:Depreciation and amortization307,151 Deferred income taxes(151,477)Equity-based compensation expense220,164 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts(678,741)Other(17,392)$3,588,163 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $929 million, inventories of $793 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $59 million; partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in deferred profit of $508 million, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $409 million, and accounts payable of $185 million. Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2021 was $73 million, primarily consisting of net sales/maturities of available for sale securities of $465 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $349 million.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 33Table of Contents Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was $4.2 billion, primarily consisting of $2.7 billion in Common Stock repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; $862 million of principal payments on debt instruments; and $727 million of dividends paid; partially offset by $122 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 27, 2021, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has in the past caused disruption in the capital markets, and were it to do the same in the future, that could make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases which are outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 27, 2021, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.The amounts in the table below exclude $527 million of net liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion.TotalLess than1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases$173,150 $48,487 $55,530 $30,505 $38,628 Financing leases 42,648 11,870 12,320 10,214 8,244 Purchase obligations818,186 660,201 114,046 40,724 3,215 Long-term debt and interest expense7,903,936 175,125 350,250 1,586,347 5,792,214 One-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings (1)659,954 69,469 199,723 390,762 — Other long-term liabilities (2) 280,342 11,704 42,079 9,453 217,106 Total$9,878,216 $976,856 $773,948 $2,068,005 $6,059,407 (1)We may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment.(2)Certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are included in the “More than 5 Years” category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities and the long-term portion of operating leases.Operating LeasesWe lease most of our administrative and regional sales/service offices as well as certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 34Table of Contents Financing LeasesFinancing leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $298 million. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 27, 2021, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. On April 1, 2021 we entered into a $1.4 billion five-year electrostatic chuck supply contract (the “Supplier Contract”), under which we are obligated, in certain circumstances, to a minimum purchase penalty obligation not to exceed $180 million. Due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments, the cash obligations and commitments table presented above excludes the minimum purchase obligation under the Supplier Contract.Capital Expenditure Requirements We are in the process of expanding our global production footprint, with expansion of our Ohio manufacturing facility as well as construction of a manufacturing facility in Malaysia and a technology center in Korea. Anticipated capital expenditures associated with these projects for buildings and equipment for fiscal year 2022 are expected to be approximately $201 million. These capital expenditures will be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations.Income TaxesDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount was $868 million. We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.Long-Term DebtOn May 5, 2020, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2050 (the “2050 Notes”), and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due June 15, 2060 (the “2060 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 1.90%, 2.875%, and 3.125%, on the 2030, 2050, and 2060 Notes, respectively, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.On March 4, 2019, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Senior Notes due March 15, 2049 (the “2049 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.75%, 4.00%, and 4.875%, respectively on the 2026, 2029 and 2049 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.On June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”). During the year ended June 27, 2021, $800 million principal value of 2021 Notes were settled upon maturity.On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.80% on the 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year. We may redeem the 2025, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2049, 2050, and 2060 Notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before December 15, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, before January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, before December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, before March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, before September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, before December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and before December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after December 24, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, on or after January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, on or after December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, on or after March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, on or after September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, on or after December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and on or after December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 35Table of Contents required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. On May 21, 2021, the 2041 Notes then outstanding were redeemed pursuant to Section 6.01 of the underlying indenture at a price equal to outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. During fiscal year 2021, 2020, and 2019, we made $859 million, $668 million, and $117 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and finance/capital leases.Revolving Credit ArrangementsOn March 12, 2014, the Company established an unsecured Credit Agreement. This agreement was amended on November 10, 2015 (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), October 13, 2017 (the “2nd Amendment”), February 25, 2019 (the “3rd Amendment”), and June 17, 2021 (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Among other things, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $250 million increase in the Company’s revolving credit facility, from $1.25 billion to $1.50 billion with a syndicate of lenders, along with an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.10 billion. The facility matures on June 17, 2026. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.30%, or (2) a LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.805% to 1.30%, in each case plus a facility fee, with such spread and facility fee determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Such spreads and such facility fees are further subject to sustainability adjustments as described in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, in each case based on the Company’s performance of certain energy savings and health and safety standards metrics. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement incorporates provisions for the replacement of LIBOR or other reference rates with alternative reference rates under certain circumstances, including when, or if, such reference rates cease to be available. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 27, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants.Commercial Paper ProgramOn November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. Individual maturities may vary but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In July 2021, we amended the CP Program size to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program. If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by our Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 27, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.Other GuaranteesWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 27, 2021, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 27, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $74 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.We have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, consistent with our Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. We do not believe, based on historical Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 36Table of Contents experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 27, 2021, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as other expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target a capital preservation-focused investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed-income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS with a minimum interest rate of zero BPS.

The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.Long-Term DebtAs of June 27, 2021, we had $5.0 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $5.6 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Lam Research Corporation 2021 10-K 37Table of Contents Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 27, 2021, were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decrease in Stock PriceFair Valueas ofValuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increase in Stock PriceJune 27,2021(25)%(15)%(10)%—%10%15%25%(in thousands)Mutual funds$72,128 $81,745 $86,554 $96,171 $105,788 $110,597 $120,214 Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) RiskWe conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S dollar transactions or cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other expense, net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other expense, net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 27, 2021, are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent.

We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.We are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:•domestic and international trade regulations, policies, practices, relations, disputes and issues;•domestic and international tariffs, export controls and other barriers;•developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources;•global or national economic and political conditions;•changes in currency controls;•differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;•our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;•changes in and compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, environmental, tax, and labor laws;•fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;•the need for technical support resources in different locations; and•our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, stay at home orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic.There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, or the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. Certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments, and our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues. As is discussed below under the heading “Our Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China,” the U.S. government has recently expanded export license requirements that impact trade with China. In addition, the U.S. government is in the process of assessing technologies that may be subject to new or additional export controls, and it is possible that such controls, if and when imposed, could adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. Furthermore, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 18Table of Contents respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.We Face Risks Related to the Disruption of Our Primary Manufacturing and R&D FacilitiesWhile we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing and R&D facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations. These locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, widespread outbreaks of illness, terrorist activities, political or governmental unrest or instability, disruptions of our information technology resources, utility interruptions, the effects of climate change, or other events beyond our control. Such disruptions may cause delays in developing or shipping our products, in engaging with customers on new product applications, or in supporting customers, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, R&D and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, “stay at home” orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic.We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue DiversificationWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. Our products are priced up to the tens of millions of dollars per system. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:•a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;•a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;•export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets;•an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate;•increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;•increased pressure from regional competitors;•technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 19Table of Contents strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKSOur Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China. China represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in China, represented approximately 31%, 35%, and 31% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. Recently, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition, and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future. For example, since the start of calendar year 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce enacted a new rule that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end-uses, added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list under suspicions of military-civil fusion, support of Russia, or other factors associated with a broadening scope of national security concerns (including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 20Table of Contents Corporation, or SMIC, and related entities), and expanded an existing rule (referred to as the foreign direct product rule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. These rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to specified customers in China, such as SMIC (where those products would not otherwise require an export license to China), and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our customers (including but not limited to Chinese customers) may require U.S. export licenses for the use of our products in order to manufacture products, including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits, for those of their customers (i.e. Huawei and its affiliates) that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. The U.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue. The implementation, interpretation and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory actions or changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-boycott compliance, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, antitrust regulations, and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions, as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we do not fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced operating income, and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 21Table of Contents On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law. In general, the provisions of the IRA will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024, with certain exceptions. The IRA includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases applicable to repurchases after December 31, 2022. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of the IRA. While we do not currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis is ongoing and incomplete, and it is possible that the IRA could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability. Recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries. In addition, President Joseph Biden has made several corporate income tax proposals, including a significant increase to the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income. If enacted, such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate.A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.Our Bylaws Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Judicial Forum for Certain Legal Actions Between the Company and its Stockholders, Which May Discourage Lawsuits with Respect to Such Claims Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent otherwise, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims (including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit), such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty, claims arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This is a general summary of the bylaw provision; you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details. While the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision, as recent court decisions have held. As a Delaware corporation, Delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs, including duties that our directors, officers, employees, and others owe to the Company and its stockholders. We believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us, and our stockholders, by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs, promoting consistent application of Delaware law in these lawsuits, and reducing the possibility of duplicative, costly, multi-jurisdictional litigation with the potential for inconsistent outcomes. However, the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than Delaware, and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits.FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKSThe Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:•general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•margin trading, short sales, hedging and derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products; or•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 22Table of Contents sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value. We review all other long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets requires significant judgement. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. When evaluating goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. When evaluating other long-lived assets, if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per ShareWe have $5.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.5 billion commercial paper program and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.1 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•risk associated with the alternative reference rate reform (e.g. LIBOR transition);•risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;•a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;•create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 23Table of Contents Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesOur executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, Korea; and Villach, Austria. In addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support, and sales personnel throughout the United States, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in California, Ohio, Oregon, Austria, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan. In July 2021, our new advanced technology production facility in Malaysia began production. The Company owns two properties in Fremont, as well as the majority of the Tualatin facilities. The majority of the Fremont and Livermore facilities are held under finance leases expiring in September 2027. Our Fremont, Livermore, and Villach leases include options to renew or purchase the facilities. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsPlease refer to the subsection entities “Legal Proceedings” within Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 24Table of Contents PART IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStock InformationOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select MarketSM under the symbol “LRCX.” As of August 22, 2022, we had 462 stockholders of record. DividendsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2022, our quarterly dividend declared was $1.50 per share. Repurchases of Company SharesIn May 2022, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock; this authorization supplements the remaining balance from any prior authorization. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn June 2, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""June 2022 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 717 thousand shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 2, 2022. The total number of shares received under the June 2022 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2022 ASR will occur between August 18, 2022 and November 4, 2022. On February 15, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""February 2022 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $600 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 758 thousand shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on February 15, 2022. The total number of shares received under the February 2022 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the February 2022 ASR occurred in May 2022, resulting in the receipt of approximately 438 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of $502.06 for the transaction period.On August 31, 2021, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “August 2021 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $650 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 806 thousand shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on August 31, 2021. The total number of shares received under the August 2021 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the August 2021 ASR occurred in January 2022, resulting in the receipt of approximately 265 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of $606.71 for the transaction period.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 25Table of Contents Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchased (1)AveragePrice Paidper Share(2)Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor ProgramsAmountAvailableUnderRepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 27, 2021$4,222,220 Quarter ended September 26, 20211,737 $608.89 1,725 3,012,476 Quarter ended December 26, 2021685 $634.51 677 2,582,493 Quarter ended March 27, 20222,231 $597.66 2,007 1,382,287 March 28, 2022 - April 24, 20223 $482.67 — 1,382,287 Board authorization, $5.0 billion, May 2022— $— — 6,382,287 April 25, 2022 - May 22, 2022903 $470.86 900 6,164,869 May 23, 2022 - June 26, 20221,015 $507.47 1,012 5,514,636 Total 6,574 $485.14 (3)6,321 $5,514,636 (1)During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, we acquired 253 thousand shares at a total cost of $138.1 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans.

[Reserved] Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2022 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2022 Form 10-K.)Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. Their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from cloud computing, the IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.Wafer fabrication equipment spending was strong throughout the 2022 fiscal year driven by increasing device manufacturing complexity and the robust secular demand for semiconductors for NAND, DRAM, and foundry logic markets. Over the longer term, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will lead to an increase in the served addressable market for our products and services in the deposition, etch, and clean businesses. During fiscal year 2022, customer demand remained solid; however, ongoing supply chain constraints broadened during the period and impacted our ability to fulfill demand. While we have seen improvements in both our operations and those of our suppliers, we expect supply shortages as well as inflationary cost pressures to persist in at least the near term. Risks and Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 28Table of Contents uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, broadening supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. The following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended ChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages)Revenue$17,227,039 $14,626,150 $10,044,736 $2,600,889 17.8 %$4,581,414 45.6 %Gross margin$7,871,807 $6,805,306 $4,608,693 $1,066,501 15.7 %$2,196,613 47.7 %Gross margin as a percent of total revenue45.7 %46.5 %45.9 %(0.8)%0.6%Total operating expenses$2,489,985 $2,323,283 $1,934,891 $166,702 7.2 %$388,392 20.1 %Net income$4,605,286 $3,908,458 $2,251,753 $696,828 17.8 %$1,656,705 73.6 %Net income per diluted share$32.75 $26.90 $15.10 $5.85 21.7 %$11.80 78.1 %Fiscal year 2022 revenue increased over 17% compared to fiscal year 2021, reflecting continued strong customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, freight and logistics, and labor-related expenses, as well as unfavorable customer and product mix, partially offset by decreased variable compensation. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount, supplies expense, rent, repair and utilities expense, and outside services spending, partially offset by lower deferred compensation plan-related costs. Fiscal year 2021 revenue increased approximately 46% compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix, partially offset by higher costs incurred in freight and logistics as well as start-up expenses for our new Malaysia manufacturing facility. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services, deferred compensation plan-related costs, and supplies, partially offset by lower travel expenses and miscellaneous costs. Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.9 billion as of June 26, 2022, compared to $6.0 billion as of June 27, 2021. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $3.1 billion for fiscal year 2022 compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2021. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2022 was primarily used for $3.9 billion in treasury stock purchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; $815 million in dividends paid to our stockholders; and $546 million of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $114 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.Results of OperationsRevenue Year EndedJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020Revenue (in millions)$17,227 $14,626 $10,045 China31 %35 %31 %Korea23 %27 %24 %Taiwan17 %14 %19 %Japan9 %9 %9 %United States8 %6 %8 %Southeast Asia8 %6 %6 %Europe4 %3 %3 %Revenue increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020, primarily due to the increased investment by our customers in semiconductor capital equipment as well as higher revenue from our Customer Support Business Group for spares, services, upgrades and mature node equipment. The overall Asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region. The deferred revenue balance was $2.2 billion as of June 26, 2022 compared to $1.1 billion as of June 27, 2021, driven by additional deferrals related to tools pending full delivery and future servicing of our existing installed base.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 29Table of Contents The following table presents our revenue disaggregated between system and customer support-related revenue:Year EndedJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020(in thousands)Systems Revenue$11,322,271 $9,764,845 $6,625,130 Customer support-related revenue and other5,904,768 4,861,305 3,419,606 $17,227,039 $14,626,150 $10,044,736 Please refer to Note 4: Revenue of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the composition of the two categories into which revenue has been disaggregated.The percentage of leading- and non-leading-edge equipment and upgrade revenue from each of the markets we serve was as follows: Year EndedJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020Memory60 %61 %58 %Foundry26 %32 %31 %Logic/integrated device manufacturing14 %7 %11 %Gross Margin Year EndedChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except percentages)Gross margin$7,871,807 $6,805,306 $4,608,693 $1,066,501 15.7 %$2,196,613 47.7 %Percent of revenue45.7 %46.5 %45.9 %(0.8)%0.6%The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, freight and logistics, and labor-related expenses, as well as unfavorable customer and product mix, partially offset by decreased variable compensation.The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to customer and product mix, partially offset by increased spending on freight and logistics due in significant part to COVID-19 disruptions, start-up expenses for our Malaysia manufacturing facility, and deferred compensation plan-related costs.Research and Development Year EndedChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except percentages)Research & development$1,604,248 $1,493,408 $1,252,412 $110,840 7.4 %$240,996 19.2 %Percent of revenue9.3 %10.2 %12.5 %(0.9)%(2.3)%We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was mainly driven by an increase of $89 million in employee-related costs due in part to increased headcount and $43 million in spending for supplies, partially offset by a decrease of $44 million in deferred compensation plan-related costs. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by an increase of $137 million in employee-related costs due in part to increased headcount, $49 million in outside service costs, $32 million in deferred compensation plan-related costs, and $27 million in spending for suppliesLam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 30Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Year EndedChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except percentages)Selling, general, and administrative (""SG&A"")$885,737 $829,875 $682,479 $55,862 6.7 %$147,396 21.6 %Percent of revenue5.1 %5.7 %6.8 %(0.6)%(1.1)%The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by an increase of $28 million in outside service costs, $28 million in spending for rent, repair and utilities, and $26 million in employee-related costs due in part to increased headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $29 million in deferred compensation plan-related costs.The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a $97 million increase in employee-related costs due in part to increased headcount, $37 million in outside service costs, and $21 million in deferred compensation plan-related costs, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in travel and entertainment costs.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year EndedChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except percentages)Interest income$15,209 $19,687 $85,433 $(4,478)(22.7)%$(65,746)(77.0)%Interest expense(184,759)(208,597)(177,440)$23,838 (11.4)%$(31,157)17.6 %(Losses) gains on deferred compensation plan related assets, net(38,053)61,838 5,999 $(99,891)(161.5)%$55,839 930.8 %Foreign exchange (losses) gains, net(723)(6,962)(3,317)$6,239 (89.6)%$(3,645)109.9 %Other, net19,618 22,815 (9,499)$(3,197)(14.0)%$32,314 (340.2)%$(188,708)$(111,219)$(98,824)$(77,489)69.7 %$(12,395)12.5 %Interest income decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 as a result of lower cash balances.

Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year EndedChangeJune 26,2022June 27,2021June 28,2020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$587,828 $462,346 $323,225 $125,482 27.1 %$139,121 43.0 %Effective tax rate11.3 %10.6 %12.6 %0.7%(2.0)%The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 31Table of Contents The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below.In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by Altera Corporation (“Altera”) in July 2019. In that quarter, we evaluated the impact of the decision and viewed the denial as an indication that Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. As a result, we reversed $75 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 29, 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from our intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In February 2020, Altera petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States (""SCOTUS"") to hear their case. In June 2020, the SCOTUS denied the petition.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K.A provision enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act requires companies to capitalize research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 (our fiscal year 2023). If this provision is not repealed or deferred, we expect our fiscal year 2023 cash tax payments to increase significantly compared to our fiscal year 2022.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. In general, the provisions of the IRA will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024, with certain exceptions. The IRA includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of the IRA. The impact on income taxes due to changes in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. While we do not currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis is ongoing and incomplete, and it is possible that the IRA could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability. We will continue to monitor issuance of additional guidance.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $1,103 million and $772 million at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $234 million and $187 million and a valuation allowance representing our entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California of $309 million and $277 million at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2022 and 2021 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries and tax credits and increases in gross deferred tax liabilities for capital assets.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; andLam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 32Table of Contents •the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.Identify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 33Table of Contents Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.If after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.For other long-lived assets, we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we de-recognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2022 compared to $6.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021. This decrease was primarily due to Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program, dividends paid, and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities.Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $3.1 billion during fiscal year 2022 consisted of (in thousands):Net income$4,605,286 Non-cash charges:Depreciation and amortization333,739 Deferred income taxes(257,438)Equity-based compensation expense259,064 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts(1,796,226)Other(44,751)$3,099,674 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $1.3 billion, inventories of $1.4 billion, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $53 million; partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in deferred profit of $605 million, accounts payable of $168 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $123 million. Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 34Table of Contents Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was $612 million, primarily consisting of net sales/maturities of available for sale securities of $1.2 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures of $546 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was $4.6 billion, primarily consisting of $3.9 billion in Common Stock repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; and $815 million of dividends paid; partially offset by $114 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 26, 2022, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has in the past caused disruption in the capital markets, and were it to do the same in the future, that could make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Certain obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases; refer to Notes 14 and 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion. Our off-balance sheet arrangements and our transition tax liability are presented as purchase obligations, refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 26, 2022, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 35Table of Contents Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. As of June 26, 2022, our fixed income securities total $135.7 million. Market changes with hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, with a minimum interest rate of zero BPS, are not significant. We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.Long-Term DebtAs of June 26, 2022, we had $5.0 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $4.5 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. As of June 26, 2022, our publicly traded securities total $95.2 million. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% are not significant.Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) RiskWe conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S dollar transactions or cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 26, 2022, are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent.Lam Research Corporation 2022 10-K 36Table of Contents NotionalAmountUnrealized FXGain/(Loss)Valuation of FX Contracts Given an X%Increase (+)/Decrease(-) in EachJune 26,2022= +/- (10%)= +/- (15%) (in thousands)Forward contracts, cash flow hedgesSellJapanese yen$541,999 $27,396 $50,808 $76,213 BuyEuro150,020 (9,365)13,927 20,891 BuyIndian rupee70,768 (630)7,109 10,663 BuyKorean won57,220 (4,110)5,287 7,930 BuyMalaysian ringgit28,203 133 2,793 4,189 $13,424 $79,924 $119,886 The notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges, as of June 26, 2022, are shown in the table below.

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2023,"Item 7. Results of Operations of this 2023 Form 10-K, accounted for approximately 91%, 92%, and 94% of total revenue in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.We are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:•domestic and international trade regulations, policies, practices, relations, disputes and issues;•domestic and international tariffs, export controls and other barriers;•developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources;•global or national economic and political conditions;•changes in currency controls;•differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;•our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;•changes in and compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, environmental, tax, and labor laws;•fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;•the need for technical support resources in different locations; and•our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences can lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This can adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, and any reciprocal retaliatory actions, can increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, disrupt our supply chain operations, or inhibit our ability to sell products or provide services, which has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. Certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments, and our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, has limited and could in the future further limit the market for our products and has had and could in the future have an adverse impact on our revenues. As is discussed below under the heading “Our Sales to Customers in China, a Significant Region for Us, Have Been Impacted, and are Likely to Be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China,” the U.S. government has recently imposed new controls, including expanded export license requirements, that significantly impact trade with China. In addition, the U.S. government has an ongoing process of assessing technologies that may be subject to new or additional export controls, and it is possible that such additional controls, if and when imposed, could further adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. The implementation by the U.S. government of broad export controls restricting access to our technology (such as recent controls limiting exports to China) may cause customers with international operations to reconsider their use of and reliance on our products, which could adversely impact our future revenue and profits. Furthermore, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, take retaliatory actions; insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. Further, in periods in which the U.S. dollar is strong relative to the local currencies of our international customers, this can potentially reduce demand for our products, which may compound the adverse effect of foreign exchange translation on our revenue. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 16Table of Contents assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. In addition, our currency hedges do not necessarily mitigate the potential negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar on demand for our products. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.Our Business Relies on Technology, Data, Intellectual Property and Other Sensitive Information That is Susceptible to Cybersecurity and Other Threats or IncidentsOur business is dependent upon the use and protection of technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, which may be owned by, or licensed to, us or third parties, such as our customers and vendors. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the creation, transmission, use and storage of much of this information, and for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include but are not limited to, telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications, and email. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and Cloud providers. In addition, we make use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers, or third-party networks and servers, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the Internet for their function. The technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect are subject to loss, release, misappropriation or misuse, and the information systems containing or transmitting such technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information are subject to disruption, breach or failure, in each case as a result of various possible causes. Such causes may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment. Such causes may also include the use of techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time.We have experienced cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the past. Although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future. If we were subject to a cybersecurity or other incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such adverse effects might include:•loss of (or inability to access, e.g. through ransomware) confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems;•the disruption of the proper function of our products, services and/or operations;•the failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes;•errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work;•the loss or public exposure of the personal or other confidential information of our employees, customers or other parties;•the public release of customer financial and business plans, customer orders and operational results;•exposure to claims from our employees or third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents; •misappropriation or theft of our or a customer’s, supplier’s or other party’s assets or resources, including technology data, intellectual property or other sensitive information and costs associated therewith;•reputational damage;•diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; or•our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax information and other required communications.While we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on and to the technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe, and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents. It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen. In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 17Table of Contents We May Not Achieve the Expected Benefits of Our Restructuring Plans and Business Transformation Initiatives, and These Efforts Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Operations, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Competitive PositionIn January 2023 we announced that we are implementing a restructuring plan consisting of a workforce reduction, and that we anticipate undertaking, and may in the future undertake, additional business restructuring, realignment and transformation initiatives. We expect to incur material costs and charges in connection with these plans and initiatives. While the restructuring plan is intended to better align our cost structure with the current economic environment and future business opportunities, and our anticipated transformation initiatives have the goal of strengthening our operations and achieving operational efficiencies, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these plans and initiatives. Implementation of these plans and initiatives may be costly and disruptive to our business, we may not be able to complete them at the cost or within the time frame contemplated, and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated benefits within the projected timing or at all. Restructuring and transformation may adversely affect our internal programs and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods, may require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and may be distracting to employees and management, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Additionally, reductions in our workforce may cause a reduction in our production output capabilities which could impact our ability to manufacture or ship products to customers within a mutually beneficial timeline. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. For more information about our restructuring plan, see Note 22 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K.Disruptions to Our Supply Chain and Outsource Providers Could Impact Our Ability to Meet Demand, Increase Our Costs, and Adversely Impact Our Revenue and Operating ResultsOur supply chain has played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support. Our business depends on our timely supply of products and services to meet the demand from our customers, which depends in significant part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from our direct suppliers to us, and to our direct suppliers by other companies. In addition, outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role both in the manufacturing and customer-focused operations described above, and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or perform services or to recognize revenue, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, materials or services, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays and increased costs of shipment due to transportation interruptions, capacity constraints, or fuel shortages;•shortages of semiconductor or other components or materials as a result of increases in demand;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•transportation or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, widespread outbreak of illness, natural or man-made disasters, or climate change.Demand for electronic products and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in, and may in the future result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture, deliver and install our products, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions. Such shortages, delays and unpredictability have adversely impacted, and may in the future impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand. In addition, difficulties in obtaining parts, materials or services necessary to deliver or install products or perform services have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our ability to recognize revenue, our gross margins on the revenue we recognize, and our other operating results. Although we are endeavoring to pass along some of the impact of increased costs to our customers to counteract adverse impacts to our gross margins and other operating results, such measures could be unsuccessful, or could have the effect of reducing demand, which would adversely impact our revenue.Further, increased restrictions imposed on a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), which are widely used in a large number of products, including parts and materials that are incorporated into our products, may negatively impact our supply chain due to the potentially decreased availability, or non-availability, of PFAS-containing products. Proposed regulations under consideration could require that we transition away from the usage of PFAS-containing products, which could adversely impact our business, operations, revenue, costs, and competitive position. There is no assurance that suitable replacements for PFAS-containing parts and materials will be available at similar costs, or at all. Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 18Table of Contents Although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where we conduct our manufacturing. There is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. The COVID-19 Pandemic Adversely Impacted, and May in the Future Adversely Impact, Our Business, Operations, and Financial ResultsThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts by national, state and local governments worldwide to control its spread resulted in measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns, and shelter in place or “stay at home” orders, which collectively significantly restricted the movement of people and goods and the ability of businesses to operate. These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, affected and in the future may affect our business and operations by, among other things, causing facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; disrupting production by our supply chain; disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that impede manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by portions of our workforce. These impacts caused and in the future may cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations, which caused and in the future may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. The pandemic resulted at various times in significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty, which adversely impacted our business and may do so in the future, and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers, and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. We Face Risks Related to the Disruption of Our Primary Manufacturing and R&D FacilitiesWhile we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing and R&D facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations. These locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, widespread outbreaks of illness, war, terrorist activities, political or governmental unrest or instability, disruptions of our information technology resources, utility interruptions, the effects of climate change, or other events beyond our control. Such disruptions may cause delays in developing or shipping our products, in engaging with customers on new product applications, or in supporting customers, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue DiversificationWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. Our products are priced up to the tens of millions of dollars per system. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:•a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;•a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;•export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets;•an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate;•increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;•increased pressure from regional competitors;•technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 19Table of Contents We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKSOur Sales to Customers in China, a Significant Region for Us, Have Been Impacted, and are Likely to Be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and ChinaChina represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in China, represented approximately 26%, 31%, and 35% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. Recently, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition, Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 20Table of Contents and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future. Most recently, the U.S. government has enacted new rules aimed at restricting China’s ability to manufacture advanced semiconductors, which include restrictions on exports, reexports or transfers to, or shipping, transmitting, transferring, or facilitating such movement to, or performing services at, customer facilities in China engaged in certain technology end-uses, without appropriate authorizations obtained from U.S. authorities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has enacted new rules that have expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses; has added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list and unverified list under suspicion of military-civil fusion, support of Russia, or other factors associated with a broadening scope of national security concerns (including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and related entities, and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd., or YMTC, and related entities); and has expanded an existing rule (referred to as the foreign direct product rule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. These rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to customers in China, such as SMIC, YMTC and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc., and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our customers (including but not limited to Chinese customers) may require U.S. export licenses for the use of our products in order to manufacture products, including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits, for those of their customers (i.e. Huawei and its affiliates) that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. The U.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or unverified list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue. The implementation, interpretation and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory actions or changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-boycott compliance, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, antitrust regulations, and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions, as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we do not fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced operating income, and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 21Table of Contents Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, in material audit assessments, or in expirations of agreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law. In general, the provisions of the IRA will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024, with certain exceptions. The IRA includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax. We have evaluated the potential impacts of the IRA and do not expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. However, we expect future guidance from the Treasury Department and will further analyze when the guidance is issued.Recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 (“BEPS 2.0”) project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries, including the implementation of a global minimum tax. Several countries around the world have enacted or proposed changes to their existing tax laws based on these recommendations. As each country in which we operate evaluates their alignment with the recommendations, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our effective tax rate remain uncertain. When fully enacted, such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. We will continue to monitor the progress of the BEPS 2.0 implementation.In addition, the U.S. has made several corporate income tax proposals, including changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income. If enacted, such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Increasing and Evolving Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, sale, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and the regulatory environment is dynamic. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations (such as future regulations imposed on the use or sale of PFAS or PFAS-containing products) could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter or discontinue our current operations in certain jurisdictions, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Compliance obligations, as well as any failure to comply with current or future regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances (including, but not limited to, PFAS) could subject us to future costs and liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.Our Bylaws Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Judicial Forum for Certain Legal Actions Between the Company and its Stockholders, Which May Discourage Lawsuits with Respect to Such Claims Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent otherwise, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims (including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit), such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty, claims arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This is a general summary of the bylaw provision; you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details. While the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision, as recent court decisions have held. As a Delaware corporation, Delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs, including duties that our directors, officers, employees, and others owe to the Company and its stockholders. We believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us, and our stockholders, by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs, promoting consistent application of Delaware law in these lawsuits, and reducing the possibility of duplicative, costly, multi-jurisdictional litigation with the potential for inconsistent outcomes. However, the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than Delaware, and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits.FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKSThe Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 22Table of Contents •general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;•macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including those caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine or bank failures; and geopolitical issues;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•margin trading, short sales, hedging and derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products; or•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value. We review all other long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets requires significant judgement. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. When evaluating goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. When evaluating other long-lived assets, if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Our Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per ShareWe have $5.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.5 billion commercial paper program and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.1 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;•a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 23Table of Contents Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;•create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.If One or More of Our Counterparty Financial Institutions Default on Their Obligations To Us or Fail, We May Incur Significant Losses.As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions both in and out of the United States. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions, which may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesOur executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, Korea; Bengaluru, India; Salzburg, Austria; and Villach, Austria. In addition, we lease or own properties for our service, technical support, and sales personnel throughout the United States, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan and lease or own manufacturing facilities located in California, Ohio, Oregon, Austria, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan. The Company owns two properties in Fremont, as well as the majority of the Tualatin facilities. The majority of the Fremont and Livermore facilities are held under finance leases expiring in September 2027. Our Fremont, Livermore, and Villach leases include options to renew or purchase the facilities. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 24Table of Contents Item 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStock InformationOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select MarketSM under the symbol “LRCX.” As of August 10, 2023, we had 439 stockholders of record. DividendsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2023, our quarterly dividend declared was $1.725 per share. Repurchases of Company SharesIn May 2022, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock; this authorization supplements the remaining balance from any prior authorization. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn June 2, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""June 2022 ASR"") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 717 thousand shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 2, 2022. The total number of shares received under the June 2022 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2022 ASR occurred in September 2022, resulting in the receipt of approximately 433 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of $435.20 for the transaction period.Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchased (1)AveragePrice Paidper Share (2, 3)Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor ProgramsAmountAvailableUnderRepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 26, 2022$5,514,636 Quarter ended September 25, 2022686 $433.47 675 5,409,654 Quarter ended December 25, 20221,133 $429.27 1,125 4,926,428 Quarter ended March 26, 20231,165 $477.15 1,017 4,443,010 March 27, 2023 - April 23, 2023379 $508.62 377 4,251,363 April 24, 2023 - May 21, 2023608 $535.36 603 3,928,585 May 22, 2023 - June 25, 2023638 $615.18 636 3,537,217 Total 4,609 $560.47 (4)4,433 $3,537,217 (1)During the fiscal year ended June 25, 2023, we acquired 176 thousand shares at a total cost of $85.4 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2023 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2023 Form 10-K.)Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.Executive SummaryLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. Their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from cloud computing, 5G, the Internet of Things, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.During fiscal year 2023, customer demand weakened in the second half of the year due to wafer fabrication equipment spending reductions resulting primarily from incremental demand weakness in memory. In addition, the U.S. government’s restrictions on sales of equipment, parts, and service for specific technologies and customers in China further impacted equipment demand in the year. While we did experience supply chain constraints in the first half of fiscal year 2023, there were improvements and we were able to fulfill shipments of nearly all our outstanding back order systems in the second half of the year. As a result of the expected reduced business levels, we initiated a restructuring plan in the quarter-ended March 26, 2023 designed to better align the Company’s cost structure with our outlook. We incurred a charge for the workforce actions associated with the restructuring plan of approximately $107 million in fiscal year 2023. Over the course of calendar year 2023, we are projecting expenditures in the range of $250 million Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 28Table of Contents associated with various business process improvements and initiatives, inclusive of the fiscal year 2023 restructuring activity. Risks and uncertainties related to trade restrictions, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Over the longer term, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors combined with technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will drive sustainable growth and lead to an increase in the served available market for our products and services in the deposition, etch, and clean businesses. The following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended ChangeJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages)Revenue$17,428,516 $17,227,039 $14,626,150 $201,477 1.2 %$2,600,889 17.8 %Gross margin$7,776,925 $7,871,807 $6,805,306 $(94,882)(1.2)%$1,066,501 15.7 %Gross margin as a percent of total revenue44.6 %45.7 %46.5 %(1.1)%(0.8)%Total operating expenses$2,602,065 $2,489,985 $2,323,283 $112,080 4.5 %$166,702 7.2 %Net income$4,510,931 $4,605,286 $3,908,458 $(94,355)(2.0)%$696,828 17.8 %Net income per diluted share$33.21 $32.75 $26.90 $0.46 1.4 %$5.85 21.7 %Fiscal year 2023 revenue was slightly higher than fiscal year 2022. Customer support-related revenue increased in fiscal year 2023 due to continued strength in specialty node investments, which was offset by a decline in our systems revenue as a result of semiconductor demand weakness, largely in the memory market. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, as well as costs associated with restructuring related activities, partially offset by favorable customer and product mix. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was driven by higher deferred compensation plan-related costs, restructuring-related charges, employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount, depreciation and amortization, and supplies, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets as the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Novellus have fully amortized. Fiscal year 2022 revenue increased over 17% compared to fiscal year 2021, reflecting continued strong customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, freight and logistics, and labor-related expenses, as well as unfavorable customer and product mix, partially offset by decreased variable compensation. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount, supplies expense, rent, repair and utilities expense, and outside services spending, partially offset by lower deferred compensation plan-related costs.We aim to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, as well as performance to our operational and financial objectives. As a result, from time to time, we exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries of products, which has impacted, including in the current fiscal year, and may in the future impact, the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products.Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $5.6 billion as of June 25, 2023, compared to $3.9 billion as of June 26, 2022. Cash flows provided from operating activities was $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2023 compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal year 2022. Cash flows provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2023 was primarily used for $2.0 billion in treasury stock purchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; $908 million in dividends paid to our stockholders; and $502 million of capital expenditures.

Revenue increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the increased investment by our customers in semiconductor capital equipment as well as from CSBG for spares, services, upgrades and mature node equipment. While the overall Asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues, the U.S. and Europe regions increased in each of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year as these regions prioritized domestic capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing. The deferred revenue balance was $1.8 billion as of June 25, 2023 compared to $2.2 billion as of June 26, 2022. Advance deposit additions from newer customers increased in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, offsetting the decline in deferred balances related to shipments we completed of tools that had critical parts outstanding.The following table presents our revenue disaggregated between system and customer support-related revenue:Year EndedJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021(in thousands)Systems Revenue$10,695,897 $11,322,271 $9,764,845 Customer support-related revenue and other6,732,619 5,904,768 4,861,305 $17,428,516 $17,227,039 $14,626,150 Please refer to Note 4: Revenue of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the composition of the two categories into which revenue has been disaggregated.The percentage of leading- and non-leading-edge equipment and upgrade revenue from each of the markets we serve was as follows: Year EndedJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021Memory42 %60 %61 %Foundry38 %26 %32 %Logic/integrated device manufacturing20 %14 %7 %Gross Margin Year EndedChangeJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21 (in thousands, except percentages)Gross margin$7,776,925 $7,871,807 $6,805,306 $(94,882)(1.2)%$1,066,501 15.7 %Percent of revenue44.6 %45.7 %46.5 %(1.1)%(0.8)%The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, partially offset by favorable customer and product mix.The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs, freight and logistics, and labor-related expenses, as well as unfavorable customer and product mix, partially offset by decreased variable compensation.Research and Development Year EndedChangeJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21 (in thousands, except percentages)Research & development$1,727,162 $1,604,248 $1,493,408 $122,914 7.7 %$110,840 7.4 %Percent of revenue9.9 %9.3 %10.2 %0.6%(0.9)%We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes.

Under the plan we terminated approximately 1,650 employees, incurring expenses related to employee severance and separation costs. Employee severance and separation costs primarily relate to severance, non-cash severance, including equity award compensation expense, pension and other termination benefits. Additionally, we made a strategic decision to relocate certain manufacturing activities to pre-existing facilities and incurred costs to move inventory and equipment and exit selected supplier arrangements.During fiscal year 2023 net restructuring costs of $78 million and $42 million were recorded in restructuring charges, net - cost of goods sold, and restructuring charges, net - operating expenses, respectively of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the payoff of $800 million of senior notes in June 2021.The gains or losses on deferred compensation plan related assets, net were driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of the underlying funds for all periods presented.Foreign exchange fluctuations were primarily due to currency movements against portions of our unhedged balance sheet exposures for all periods presented.The variation in other, net for the fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of equity investments. Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year EndedChangeJune 25,2023June 26,2022June 27,2021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21 (in thousands, except percentages)Income tax expense$598,279 $587,828 $462,346 $10,451 1.8 %$125,482 27.1 %Effective tax rate11.7 %11.3 %10.6 %0.4%0.7%The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 and the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K.Beginning in our fiscal year 2023, a provision enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act requires us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes. Due to this provision, we expect our cash tax payments to increase significantly in the near term and stabilize in future years as the capitalized expenditures continue to amortize.On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. In general, the provisions of the IRA will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024, with certain exceptions. The IRA includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax. The impact on income taxes due to changes in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. We have evaluated the potential impacts of the IRA and do not expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. However, we expect future guidance from the Treasury Department and will further analyze when the guidance is issued.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 32Table of Contents Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $1,303 million and $1,103 million at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $238 million and $234 million and a valuation allowance primarily representing our entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California of $352 million and $309 million at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change in gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, tax credits, and capitalized research and experimental expenditures.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;•the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and•the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.Identify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 33Table of Contents provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made.Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.If after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 34Table of Contents For other long-lived assets, we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we de-recognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 2023 compared to $3.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2022. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program, dividends paid, and capital expenditures.Cash Flow from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 billion during fiscal year 2023 consisted of (in thousands):Net income$4,510,931 Non-cash charges:Depreciation and amortization342,432 Deferred income taxes(172,061)Equity-based compensation expense286,600 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts158,738 Other52,298 $5,178,938 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in accounts receivable of $1.5 billion, deferred profit of $163 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $136 million; partially offset by the following uses of cash: increase in inventories of $962 million, and decreases in accounts payable of $522 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $109 million.Cash Flow from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2023 was $535 million, primarily consisting of $502 million in capital expenditures and $120 million net cash disbursed for business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities of $98 million.Cash Flow from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2023 was $2.8 billion, primarily consisting of $2.0 billion in Common Stock repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; and $908 million of dividends paid; partially offset by $121 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 25, 2023, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, factors outside of our control, including uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, are currently, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 35Table of Contents In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, domestic and global macroeconomic and political conditions could cause disruptions to the capital markets and otherwise make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Certain obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases; refer to Notes 14 and 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion. Our off-balance sheet arrangements and our transition tax liability are presented as purchase obligations, refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInvestmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 25, 2023, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities are recognized as other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.Interest Rate RiskFixed-Income SecuritiesOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. As of June 25, 2023, our fixed income securities total $37.6 million. Market changes with hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, with a minimum interest rate of zero BPS, are not significant. We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.Long-Term DebtAs of June 25, 2023, we had $5.0 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $4.4 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Equity Price RiskPublicly Traded SecuritiesThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. As of June 25, 2023, our publicly traded securities total $106.7 million. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% are not significant.Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) RiskWe conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows. Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 36Table of Contents We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items. The unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 25, 2023, and the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent are not significant.The unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges, as of June 25, 2023, and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges, assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent are not significant. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net, by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.Lam Research Corporation 2023 10-K 37Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:19:58.909257

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over recent business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has increased, and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Executive Summary We believe our business model continues to set a standard for the industry. Our business model is focused on new product development, sales and marketing, and customer support which are the core competencies of the Company. Indicators of customer demand began to improve in our quarter ended September 28, 2003. This trend continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004, then declined and stabilized over the course of the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters. Fiscal year 2005 revenues increased 61% compared to fiscal year 2004 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia. The progression in our gross margin of five percentage points from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was achieved on increased sales volume, improvements in product mix, and effective asset management. Total operating expenses increased by $48.2 million, or 15% during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. Increases in operating expenses were primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits costs for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as increases for incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included restructuring charges of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value guarantee obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. 14 Table of Contents New Orders and Backlog New orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2005 were approximately: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 (in millions) $315 $ 315 $ 387 $ 429 $ 1,446 Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 26, 2005 were approximately $351 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect, among other things, customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy. Regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 North America 9 % 16 % 14 % 20 % 15 % Europe 12 % 19 % 9 % 19 % 15 % Asia Pacific 35 % 29 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Korea 16 % 14 % 40 % 15 % 22 % Japan 28 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 20 % Indicators of customer demand for wafer processing equipment improved in the quarter ended September 28, 2003 and continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004. Since that time, new orders have declined and stabilized in the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters, which reflects the investment decisions of our customers. We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 to range from flat to down 5% compared with the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenue $ 1,502,453 $ 935,946 $ 755,234 Revenue increased significantly during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. This increase reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia. Our deferred revenue 15 Table of Contents balance was $150.5 million as of June 26, 2005. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $53 million as of June 26, 2005. These shipments are classified as inventory and carried at cost. The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2005 continued the trends noted for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003, which were reflective of a market environment that had improved, evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 North America 16 % 18 % 28 % Europe 12 % 19 % 20 % Asia Pacific 38 % 42 % 29 % Korea 19 % 10 % 15 % Japan 15 % 11 % 8 % The overall Asia region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is shifting toward this region; this trend continued through fiscal year 2005. The growth in Asia Pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in Taiwan and Singapore. Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 ranges from $310 million to $330 million. This is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gross Margin Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 764,092 $ 431,049 $ 303,829 Percent of total revenue 50.9 % 46.1 % 40.2 % The increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume. The increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2004 compared with fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources, expense management programs, and improved sales volumes throughout the year. We expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 47% for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 which includes approximately $3 million, or one percentage point, in stock-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 16 Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development (R&D) $ 194,115 $ 170,479 $ 160,493 Percent of total revenue 12.9 % 18.2 % 21.3 % We continue to invest significantly in research and development in business cycle upturns and downturns. Our investments have been aimed at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next-generation products as well as enhancing our existing offerings. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $9 million for incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in R&D supplies expense of approximately $6 million. Approximately 51% of fiscal year 2005 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in spending between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $10 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. These costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities-related expenses, largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly $2 million, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 164,774 $ 146,063 $ 132,820 Percent of total revenue 11.0 % 15.6 % 17.6 % The increase in SG&A expenses during the year ended June 26, 2005 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10 million in professional services which included, among other items, expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately $3 million in stock-based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award. Expenses in fiscal year 2004 were $13 million higher than fiscal year 2003 because employee compensation costs increased by nearly $12 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also contributing to the fiscal year 2004 SG&A expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately $5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects. Additionally, the $3 million stock-based compensation charge noted above contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2004. A decrease of approximately $4 million, primarily in depreciation expense, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above. 17 Table of Contents We expect total operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) in the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will be approximately $100 million which includes an estimated $6 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). These estimates are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring Charges We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. We have historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry. We systematically reviewed our revenue outlook and forecasts and assessed their impact on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing activities scope. Based on these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December 28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan), September 28, 2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the restructuring charges include facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its terms and charges for facilities, or a portion of facilities we ceased to use. Expenses were based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, where these items were determined to have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. As of June 26, 2005, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Fiscal year 2004 restructurings $ — $ — $ — Fiscal year 2003 restructurings — 3,989 3,989 Fiscal year 2002 restructurings 178 926 1,104 Pre-fiscal year 2002 restructurings — 508 508 Balance at June 26, 2005 178 5,423 5,601 Less: portion included in other current liabilities 178 3,139 3,317 Included in long-term liabilities $ — $ 2,284 $ 2,284 The severance and benefits-related balance is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year 2005. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2011. 18 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2005 Activity During the quarter ended March 27, 2005, we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During the March 2005 quarter, we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale. We concluded, under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, that the likelihood that a liability had been incurred was probable and estimable. This transaction resulted in an increase of $10.2 million and $4.0 million to our fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans accruals, respectively. During the quarter ended June 26, 2005 we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. We exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities, which had been abandoned in prior periods. Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid during the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This transaction is reflected in the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan accrual tables below. Fiscal Year 2004 Restructuring Activities Our fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by less than 40 employees, primarily in North America and Europe and by vacating selected facilities located in North America and Asia deemed to be no longer necessary to our operations. The employees were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization. We recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8 million, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. We also recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write-off of related leasehold improvements. We recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities-related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year 2004. Charges during the year were partially offset by the recovery of $1.5 million of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold. As a result of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $0.3 million from the March 2004 Plan, $0.7 million from the December 2003 Plan and $0.5 million from the September 2003 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings from the Plans’ discrete actions were primarily related to lower employee payroll, rent, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 26, 2005, we believe actual savings from these Plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings. The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $10.2 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity. 19 Table of Contents The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2004 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 30 $ 2,077 $ 2,107 Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge — 10,157 10,157 Cash payments (30 ) (12,234 ) (12,264 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ — $ — $ — Fiscal Year 2003 Restructuring Activities Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2003 through our June 2003, March 2003 and December 2002 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of approximately $18.1 million. Our fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 200 people and vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plans were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. The $18.1 million restructuring charges consisted of $5.7 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees and $12.4 million of facilities-related charges. The facilities-related charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write-off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of our vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $18.1 million of restructuring charges. As a result of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings were primarily from lower payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Through June 26, 2005, we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts. However, other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and, consequently, partially or totally offset savings from these Plans. The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2003 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 183 $ 6,451 $ 6,634 Cash payments (183 ) (2,462 ) (2,645 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ — $ 3,989 $ 3,989 20 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2002 Restructuring Activities Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2002 through our December 2001 and September 2001 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2002 of approximately $54.8 million. Our fiscal year 2002 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 1,020 people, vacating selected facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations, the closure of certain offices in Asia, and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 83% from North America and approximately 17% from Europe and Asia locations. The restructuring charges included $25.0 million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $11.4 million in charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, $10.8 million in write-offs of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets, and $7.6 million in inventory write-downs. The inventory charge of approximately $7.6 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines. We recovered approximately $1.7 million during fiscal year 2004, $1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002, from unanticipated subsequent sales of these inventories to our installed base. We physically disposed of approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal year 2004 and $2.7 million during fiscal years 2003 and 2002. During fiscal year 2002, we also recovered approximately $1.0 million of the $54.8 million due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than planned expenses related to a vacated facility of $0.3 million. During fiscal year 2004, we recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due to the difference between costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2003, we recovered approximately $2.7 million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and $2.0 million was recovered due to revisions to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. We also recorded additional restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of $3.1 million due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California, $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs, and $0.4 million for revisions that we made in our estimates for employee termination costs. The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $4.0 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity. The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 389 $ 3,496 $ 3,885 Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge — 4,044 4,044 Cash payments (211 ) (6,614 ) (6,825 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ 178 $ 926 $ 1,104 Fiscal Year 2001 Restructuring Activities During the second quarter of fiscal year 2003, we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. The remaining $0.5 million facilities balance as of June 26, 2005 is expected to be paid by January, 2006. 21 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, was $8.1 million, $4.5 million and ($10.3) million in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and consisted of the following: Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Interest income $ 17,537 $ 9,915 $ 15,804 Loss on equity derivative contracts — — (16,407 ) Interest expense (1,413 ) (4,634 ) (6,096 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,175 ) (1,334 ) (272 ) Debt issue cost amortization — (1,593 ) (2,536 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes — 4,505 — Equity method investment losses (205 ) (426 ) (777 ) Equity method investment impairment (445 ) — — Charitable contributions (5,500 ) (1,000 ) — Other, net (679 ) (963 ) 24 $ 8,120 $ 4,470 $ (10,260 ) The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated $300.0 million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004. We elected to make charitable contributions of $5.5 million during fiscal year 2005. During fiscal year 2004, our total cash balances, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, increased each quarter through March 2004. These increases in cash balances allowed us to repay, in the June 2004 quarter, our 4% Notes prior to maturity. Although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year, interest income decreased during fiscal year 2004 as a result of lower market rates. The decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal year 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5% $300.0 million subordinated debentures (5% Notes) in September 2002. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was $99.8 million, $27.7 million, and ($7.9) million, in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25%, which primarily reflects the impact of R&D tax credits and the proportion of foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to income tax expense, during fiscal year 2004. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to R&D tax credits resulting in our recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in June 2003. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer-term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in June 2003. 22 Table of Contents Deferred Income Taxes We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $248.0 million and $303.3 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $106.0 million and $67.8 million and deferred tax liabilities of $22.2 million and $26.3 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Our current valuation allowance of $106.0 million includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. During fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million as discussed above. On October 22, 2004 the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a deduction of 85% of certain non-U.S. earnings that are repatriated to the U.S., as defined in the AJCA. On January 13, 2005 and May 10, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 and Notice 2005-38, respectively, providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. Based on our current understanding of the AJCA, we believe the range of possible amounts that we may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the repatriation is between zero and $26 million. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or 23 Table of Contents customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor performance levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. 24 Table of Contents Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Stock-Based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Incentive Plans : We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation”. Our ESPP is a non-compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB No. 25. Please see “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below regarding the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) which will become effective during our quarter ending September 25, 2005. Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions. We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 25 Table of Contents The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We account for income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.” Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF 03-01. The consensus clarifies the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. In September 2004, the FASB issued a final FASB Staff Position (FSP), EITF Issue 03-01-1, which indefinitely delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of EITF 03-01. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting EITF 03-01. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs — An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB No. 43), Chapter 4,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). We are required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in fiscal year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.” This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and supersedes APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related implementation guidance. In March, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB No. 107) which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ended September 25, 2005. The effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested, the number of stock-based awards which may be granted in the future, the life and vesting features of stock-based awards which may be granted in the future, the future market value and volatility of our stock, movements in the risk free rate of interest, award exercise and forfeiture patterns, and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award. We are currently evaluating these variables in the design of our stock-based compensation program as well as the accounting requirements under SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. In addition, we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key component of our ongoing employee incentive-based compensation plan. These awards generally are recorded at their fair value, equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of issuance, and this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee. Based on the expense for our ESPP, our outstanding unvested options, and any outstanding unvested restricted stock units, we believe that the expense for stock-based compensation for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will range from $8 million to $10 million, pre-tax. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We will apply its provisions prospectively upon adoption, and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. 26 Table of Contents In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” This statement replaces APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. APB No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: Operating Purchase Restructuring Leases Obligations Liabilities Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 13,260 $ 98,497 $ 3,317 $ 115,074 1-3 years 15,101 55,814 2,240 73,155 4-5 years 77,157 21,367 30 98,554 Over 5 years 790 498 14 1,302 Total $ 106,308 $ 176,176 $ 5,601 $ 288,085 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases 4-5 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. Please see the Guarantees section below for additional information. The remaining balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 26, 2005 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. 27 Table of Contents Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 26, 2005, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were approximately $14.8 million. Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 26, 2005 were $5.6 million, including $0.2 million of severance and benefits-related costs and $5.4 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect $3.3 million to be paid over the next twelve months and $2.3 million to be paid between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2011. Please see the related discussion in “Restructuring Activities” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. During fiscal year 2005 we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During fiscal year 2005 we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid in the quarter ended June 26, 2005. We exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities which were abandoned in prior periods. The facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated in March and June of 2003. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 26, 2005 in separate, specified interest-bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements, including indemnification for various environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 26, 2005, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. 28 Table of Contents We have agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of our Japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation. At June 26, 2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements was approximately $2.8 million, although our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under these agreements. We have an agreement enabling us to sell to a financial institution certain U.S. dollar-denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse provisions. We discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended June 26, 2005 and have no current plans to continue usage. At June 26, 2005 we had no outstanding and uncollected receivables under this agreement. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of June 26, 2005, we had $894.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash compared with $541.9 million at June 27, 2004. During fiscal year 2005, cash and cash equivalents increased by $318.8 million, including cash provided by operating activities of $425.9 million, partially offset by cash used for investing activities $58.7 million and cash used for financing activities of $52.3 million. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $425.9 million during fiscal year 2005, consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 299.3 Non-cash charges: Restructuring 14.2 Depreciation and amortization 25.5 Other, net 5.8 Decrease in deferred tax assets 89.4 Change in other working capital accounts (8.3 ) $ 425.9 Significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2005 include a decrease of $13.5 million in net accounts receivable reflecting our focus on timely customer payments. We discontinued use of our program to sell certain U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable during the quarter ended June 26, 2005, and we have no current plans to continue usage of the program. There were no uncollected sold receivables remaining as of June 26, 2005. The change in deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred profit decreased by $18.9 million reflecting marginally higher revenues as compared to shipments during fiscal year 2005. 29 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $58.7 million and consisted of net purchases of $63.3 million of short-term investments and net capital expenditures of $22.8 million which consisted primarily of engineering equipment. Restricted cash decreased by $27.4 million as a result of the closing of the property sale of certain lease facilities discussed in the “Guarantees” section above. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $52.3 million including stock repurchases of $167.1 million partially offset by net proceeds of $114.3 million from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and $0.5 million of reissuance of treasury stock. In October, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases. The terms of the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2007. During fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 5,855,000 shares of common stock at a total price of $167.1 million. As of June 26, 2005, the total amount available for repurchase under this program was $82.9 million. We expect to continue to purchase shares under this program. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we believe our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 26, 2005 are sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 30 Table of Contents Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or significance is intended, or should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear. Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: • economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically; • the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; • timing of customer acceptances of equipment; • the size and timing of orders from customers; • customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and/or acceptances; • changes in average selling prices and product mix; • our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; • our competitors’ introduction of new products; • legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; • changes in import/export regulations; • transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural disasters; • legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; • procurement shortages; • manufacturing difficulties; • the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; • new or modified accounting regulations; and • exchange rate fluctuations. Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically range in price from approximately $0.4 million to $5.7 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. 31 Table of Contents Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: • a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; • a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; • export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions which limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments; 32 Table of Contents • an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; • increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines; • technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and • a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than are our competitors that offer additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on our Business Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work to our advantage if Lam’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam’s equipment was previously used by a customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance. Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business. We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. 33 Table of Contents Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment. We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non-U.S. sales, accounted for approximately 84% in fiscal year 2005, 82% in fiscal year 2004 and 72% in fiscal year 2003 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to: • trade balance issues; • economic and political conditions; • changes in currency controls; • differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; • our ability to develop relationships with local suppliers; • compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; • fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates; • the need for technical support resources in different locations; and • our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business. Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenue and will continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, in the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over- or under-hedged on any given transaction Moreover, by hedging our Yen-denominated assets with currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends, that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the Yen, and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we have business (such as the payment of wages and leases) in other currencies. Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By Higher Than Expected Tax Rates Or Exposure To Additional Income Tax Liabilities As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. Further, if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the United States pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, our tax rate may increase, even if by a lesser amount than without such legislation. Changes in Accounting Standards for Stock-Based Compensation May Adversely Affect our Operating Results, Our Stock Price, and Our Competitiveness in the Employee Marketplace The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to expense all stock-based compensation provided to employees beginning with our quarter ending September 25, 2005. The environment for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one, and we believe that stock-based compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract and retain such employees. SFAS No. 123(R) will decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of stock-based compensation. There is some risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee retention objectives. Moreover, as we will be adopting these rules before certain other companies in our industry, there may be, for some period of time, an appearance that our earnings are lower than those of comparable companies that have not yet adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which could have a negative effect on our stock price. 35 Table of Contents A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training, managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common Stock. 36 Table of Contents The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: • general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; • global economic fluctuations; • variations in our quarterly operating results; • variations in our revenues or earnings from levels experienced by other companies in our industry or forecasts by securities analysts; • announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; • government regulations; • developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; • success or failure of our new and existing products; • liquidity of Lam; • disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or • political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation May Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with “interested stockholders”, as defined by that statute. Such factors might deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers, even if such takeover proposals or control changes could improve our short-term stock price. 37 Table of Contents Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property, there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. We Are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required, beginning with our fiscal year ended June 26, 2005, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm (Firm) is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our Firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam that, in the Firm’s professional judgment, might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with respect to us. If, for whatever reason, our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of Lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004: June 27, June 26, 2005 2004 There- Fair 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Total Value Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate $ 378,183 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 378,183 $ 378,183 $ 57,739 Average rate 3.05 % — — — — — 3.05 % — 1.20 % Short-term investments Fixed rate $ 167,979 $ 81,707 $ 44,250 $ 18,512 $ 13,724 $ 2,674 $ 328,846 $ 327,003 $ 263,009 Average rate 3.60 % 4.34 % 4.42 % 4.52 % 4.33 % 5.00 % 3.99 % — 2.47 % Auction rate preferreds Variable rate $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 4,998 Average rate — — — — — — — — 1.29 % Restricted cash Fixed rate $ 85,038 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 85,038 $ 85,038 $ 112,468 Average rate 3.00 % — — — — — 3.00 % — 1.00 % Total investment securities $ 631,200 $ 81,707 $ 44,250 $ 18,512 $ 13,724 $ 2,674 $ 792,067 $ 790,224 $ 438,214 Average rate 3.19 % 4.34 % 4.42 % 4.52 % 4.33 % 5.00 % 3.43 % — 1.91 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, and certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies. The majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. As a result, we believe that our primary exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation is naturally hedged (the revenue in local currency partially offsets the exposure to local currency expenses) except for our Japanese Yen revenue exposure in Japan. For this reason, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated receivable balances. The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $32.6 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 26, 2005, was $0.4 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $5.8 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $4.2 million. On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $66.2 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $11.7 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $8.6 million. 39 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:09.396626

Business Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research,” “we,” or the “Company”) was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. The mailing address for our principal executive offices is 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200. Additional information about Lam Research is available on our web site at http://www.lamresearch.com. Our Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K are available online at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) web site on the Internet. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K and any amendments to those reports on our corporate web site at http://www.lamresearch.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC. We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time. Etch Process Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. Lam Research etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductors by utilizing various plasma-based technologies to create critical device features at current and future technology nodes. Plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit. Advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures for the 45 nanometer (nm) and below technology nodes. At this time, memory manufacturers are transitioning from aluminum to copper conductive lines, while leading logic manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile dielectric insulating materials (low-κ and porous low-κ). Semiconductor manufacturers continue to require more precise control over the etching process in order to accommodate decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters. Lam Research etch products and services are defined around the 2300® etch series. Dielectric Etch Products 2300® Exelan®, 2300 ® Exelan® Flex™, and 2300® Exelan® Flex45™ systems. The Exelan family of dielectric etch products addresses volume manufacturing productivity requirements and enables customers to create advanced semiconductor devices. The 2300 Exelan Flex and 2300 Exelan Flex45 systems extend the capability of the 2300 Exelan family of products to address requirements for the 45 nm and below technology nodes. These systems are based on Lam Research’s patented Dual Frequency ConfinedTM plasma technology, which enables in situ processing, where multiple chemistries can be run sequentially in the same process chamber. Upgrades to the 2300 Exelan product line provide enabling capability for etching smaller features and alternative dielectric materials as outlined in the semiconductor industry’s manufacturing roadmap. 4 Table of Contents Conductor Etch Products 2300® Versys®, 2300 ® Versys® Kiyo™, 2300® Versys® Kiyo45™, 2300® Versys ® Metal High Performance, and 2300® Versys® Metal45™ systems. The Versys family of products for etching silicon and metal films utilizes Lam Research’s patented Transformer Coupled Plasma™ source technology; a high-density, low-pressure plasma source that addresses leading-edge device structure requirements for etching features at the 45 nm and below technology nodes. The systems enable sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature, which allows in situ processing of multi-layer stacks. Advanced Chamber Control and Conditioning (AC3™) technology reduces processing drift and maintains the same chamber conditions for subsequent wafers. Deep Silicon Etch Products TCP® 9400DSiE™ and 2300® Syndion™ systems. The TCP 9400DSiE employs Lam Research’s TCP technology to facilitate deep silicon etch processes used in micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), power device, and passive component fabrication. The TCP-based technology provides the process flexibility needed to address a broad range of requirements for the manufacture of MEMS devices. The 2300 Syndion, which also employs TCP technology, addresses 3-D IC through-silicon via (TSV) etch applications. TSVs provide the interconnects for die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer stacking, eliminating wire bonding to increase device packing density (smaller form factor) and improve performance (higher process speed and lower power requirements). Important for TSV applications, the Syndion’s TCP-based technology enables sequential processing the same chamber while ensuring etch rate uniformity and profile symmetry to prevent tilting. The technology also supports clean mode operation and provides bias voltage control for process repeatability. Patterning Process During semiconductor device manufacturing, lithography processes establish the templates for patterns to be created during subsequent etch processes. Patterning Products 2300® Motif ™ system. The 2300 Motif is a post-lithography pattern enhancement system that enables the creation of features as small as 10 nm by using plasma-based technology to deposit a thin film on printed photoresist holes and spaces. The film is created by applying multiple short etch-deposition cycles until the target feature size is achieved. This capability addresses a customer technology need for a solution enabling the creation of features two to three generations ahead of lithography. The system also simplifies optical proximity correction by improving the lithography profile and provides a cost-effective approach to extending lithography tool sets in select applications. Clean Process The manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch and deposition, which leave particles and residues. The wafer must generally be cleaned following these steps to remove residues that could degrade device performance. Common wafer cleaning steps include post-etch/post-strip cleans and pre-diffusion/pre-deposition cleans (also referred to as “critical cleans”), during which the wafer surface is prepared for subsequent diffusion/deposition steps. For 65 nm technologies and below, defects transferred from the wafer edge bevel can significantly limit device yield. During device patterning, complex interactions of film deposition, lithography, etching, and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) result in a wide range of unstable film stacks on the wafer edge. In subsequent process steps these film layers can produce defects that are transported to the device area of the wafer, and residues need to be removed from the wafer edge to eliminate these defect sources. Wet Clean Products Confined Chemical Cleaning™ (C3™) single-wafer technology-based systems. At the 65 nm technology node and below, devices become more susceptible to damage from the chemical environment and mechanical forces of the cleaning process. Lam Research’s single-wafer wet cleaning system, based on the Company’s proprietary C3 technology, provides high-selectivity wafer cleaning with minimal mechanically induced damage and allows flexibility in selecting cleaning chemicals that minimize damage to device structures. Advanced drying technology integrated into the cleaning unit facilitates low-defect processing of hydrophobic materials, such as advanced low-κ dielectrics. Short contact times, enabled by an innovative chemical delivery mechanism to enhance the transport of chemicals to and from the wafer surface, minimize potential erosion or etching of delicate features on the wafer, while allowing for highly selective and efficient residue removal. Bevel Clean Products 2300® CoronusTM bevel clean system. The 2300 Coronus plasma-based bevel clean system is a plasma-based technology that allows control of the wafer edge at multiple steps during the device fabrication process by selectively removing films from the wafer edge using edge-confined plasma technology. Removal of these films at select points in the integration flow reduces defects and increases device yields. Precise control of the processing zone coupled with Lam Research’s Dynamic Alignment, which provides accurate wafer placement, ensures a repeatable processing area, wafer to wafer. 5 Table of Contents 9400DSiE, AC3, C3, Confined Chemical Cleaning, Coronus, Flex, Flex45, Kiyo, Kiyo45, Metal45, Motif, Syndion, and Transformer Coupled Plasma are trademarks of Lam Research Corporation. 2300, Exelan, the Lam Research logo, Lam Research, TCP, and Versys are registered trademarks of Lam Research Corporation. Research and Development The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. Our ability to obtain and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers. Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $285.3 million, $229.4 million, and $195.3 million, respectively. The majority of spending is targeted at etch and plasma-based technology applications with an increasing proportion focused on adjacent markets, pre- and post-etch step opportunities, consistent with our multi-product growth strategy. We believe current challenges for customers in the pre- and post-etch applications present opportunities for us. We plan to leverage our extensive production experience in etch and strip into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65, 45, and 32 nm nodes, including post ion implantation strip, clean, and patterning. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers’ product needs, support our growth strategy, and enhance our competitive position. Marketing, Sales, and Service Our marketing, sales, and service efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet our customers’ needs. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs. We maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of field service engineers in place throughout the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace. We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. The warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired. Export Sales A significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States and, therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences, exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls, compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, and economic and political conditions. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows. Revenue by region was as follows: Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenue: United States $ 408,631 $ 238,009 $ 234,112 Europe 237,716 208,369 184,014 Asia Pacific 451,487 193,181 292,501 Taiwan 573,875 277,731 289,532 Korea 531,310 366,939 280,605 Japan 363,557 357,942 221,689 Total revenue $ 2,566,576 $ 1,642,171 $ 1,502,453 Please see Note 21, “Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers”, to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the geographic locations of long-lived assets. 6 Table of Contents Customers Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and licensing arrangements, which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunity. In fiscal year 2007, revenues from Hynix Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., each accounted for approximately 14% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2006, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues and revenues from Toshiba Corporation accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2005, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues. A material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses, in turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand. Backlog Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. In general, we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements. Included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted, prices and product specifications have been agreed upon, and shipment of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts. As of June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006, our backlog was approximately $643 million and $521 million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes nor actual revenue levels for succeeding periods. Manufacturing Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments. We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments. Certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier. We believe that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships. Environmental Matters We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. 7 Table of Contents Employees As of March 10, 2008, we had approximately 3,000 regular full-time employees. Each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information. All employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct. In the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the R&D and customer support functions. Competition The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process performance, productivity, customer support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, etc. Our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node provided that there is demonstrated performance to specification by the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of third-party spares provider competition. We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc. Patents and Licenses Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein. Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately 1 to 20 years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 24, 2007 (the “2007 Form 10-K). Recent Acquisitions During the quarter ended December 24, 2006, we acquired the U.S. silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. We were the largest customer of the Bullen Ultrasonics silicon business. The silicon business has become a division of Lam Research post-acquisition. The acquisition includes assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics’ silicon growing and silicon fabrication business, including assets of Bullen Ultrasonics and Bullen Semiconductor (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in Suzhou, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China (PRC). The closing of the U.S. asset acquisition occurred on November 13, 2006. The acquisition of the Suzhou assets has not yet occurred as of the date of this filing. The assets acquired consist of fixtures, intellectual property, equipment, inventory, material and supplies, contracts relating to the conduct of the business, certain licenses and permits issued by government authorities for use in connection with the operations of Eaton, Ohio and Suzhou manufacturing facilities, real property and leaseholds connected with such facilities, data and records related to the operation of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and certain proprietary rights. Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2006, the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement agreed that the closing of the sale of the Suzhou assets would take place within 5 business days following receipt by the parties of all necessary approvals, consents and authorizations of governmental and provincial authorities in the PRC and satisfaction of other customary conditions and covenants. We will pay the $2.5 million purchase price for the Suzhou assets upon the receipt of the approvals and satisfaction of conditions noted above. 8 Table of Contents The acquisition supports the competitive position and capability primarily of our dielectric Etch products by providing access to and control of critical intellectual property and manufacturing technology related to the production of silicon parts in our processing chambers. We funded the purchase price of the acquisition with existing cash resources.

Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this 2007 Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear. The Results of Our Independent Committee Review of Our Historical Stock Option Practices and Resulting Restatements May Continue to Have Adverse Effects on Our Financial Results. The review by a special committee of our Board of Directors consisting of two independent Board members (the “Independent Committee”) of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatement of our historical financial statements have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal, and other expenses during fiscal year 2008. The resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have restated our historical results of operations to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $95.2 million in the aggregate for the periods from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2006 (excluding the impact of related payroll and income taxes). We expect to amortize less than $0.1 million of compensation expense under Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) in periods subsequent to fiscal year 2006 to properly account for previously issued stock options with deemed incorrect measurement dates. Furthermore, to address potential adverse tax consequences certain of our employees have incurred or may incur as a result of the issuance and/or exercise of misdated stock options, we will take remedial actions to make such employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and other affected executive officers, whole for any or all such additional tax liabilities currently estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Such actions may cause us to incur additional cash or noncash compensation expense. See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 3, “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2007 Form 10-K for further discussion. We May Be Subject to the Risks of Lawsuits in Connection With Our Historical Stock Option Practices, the Resulting Restatements, and the Remedial Measures We Have Taken. We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of government inquiries, shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We have received a letter from a stockholder demanding that our Board of Directors take certain actions, including potentially legal action, in connection with our historical stock option practices, and threatening to sue if our Board of Directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands. Our Board of Directors is currently reviewing the letter. We may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits. Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures. Subject to certain limitations, we are obliged to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with any government inquiry or litigation related to our historical stock option practices that may arise. We currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers, although there can be no assurance that the insurance would cover all of the expenses that would be associated with any proceedings. Judgment and Estimates Utilized by Us in Determining Stock Option Grant Dates and Related Adjustments may be Subject to Change due to Subsequent SEC Guidance or Other Disclosure Requirements. In determining the restatement adjustments in connection with the stock option review, management used all reasonably available relevant information to form conclusions it believes are appropriate as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred, the dates when such actions occurred, and the determination of grant dates for financial accounting purposes based on when the requirements of the accounting standards were met. We considered various alternatives throughout the course of the review and restatement, and we believe the approaches used were the most appropriate, and that the choices of measurement dates used in our review of stock option grant accounting and restatement of our financial statements were reasonable and appropriate in our circumstances. However, the SEC may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or other filings with the SEC to provide additional disclosures pursuant to such additional guidance. Any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent SEC reports and delisting of our Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11 Table of Contents We Have not Been in Compliance With SEC Reporting Requirements and NASDAQ Listing Requirements. If We are Unable to Attain Compliance With, or Thereafter Remain in Compliance With SEC Reporting Requirements and NASDAQ Listing Requirements, There may be a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Our Stockholders. As a consequence of the Independent Committee review of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements of our financial statements, we have not been able to file our periodic reports with the SEC on a timely basis and continue to face the possibility of delisting of our stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We have now filed this 2007 Form 10-K and we believe that this filing, together with the expected filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the quarter ended September 23, 2007 (the “First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q”) and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the quarter ended December 23, 2007 (the “Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q”) with the SEC will remediate the Company’s non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c) (14), subject to the affirmative completion by the NASDAQ Stock Market Inc. (“NASDAQ”) of its compliance protocols and its notification to the Company accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with the Company’s position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the financial impact of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported, or not reported, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the Company’s Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 3, “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2007 10-K for further discussion. Until we have returned to full compliance with SEC reporting requirements and NASDAQ listing requirements, the possibility of a NASDAQ delisting exists. If this happens, the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock would be adversely affected. In addition, we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws, and we would not be able to allow our employees to exercise their outstanding options, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As a result of the delayed filings of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 23, 2007 and December 23, 2007, as well as of this 2007 Form 10-K, we will be ineligible to register our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until one year from the date the last delinquent filing is made. We may use Form S-1 to raise capital or complete acquisitions, but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner. It may be Difficult or More Costly to Obtain Director and Officer Liability Insurance Coverage as a Result of Our Stock Option Restatement. The issues arising from our restatement may make it more difficult to obtain director and officer liability insurance coverage in the future. If we are able to obtain this coverage, it could be significantly more costly than in the past, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow. If we are unable to secure appropriate director and officer liability insurance coverage on reasonable terms, our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. In that event, we believe we could have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business. Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results Are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: • economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries generally and the equipment industry specifically; • the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; • timing of customer acceptances of equipment; • the size and timing of orders from customers; • customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and/or acceptances; • changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix; • our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced, and competitive products; • our competitors’ introduction of new products; 12 Table of Contents • legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; • changes in import/export regulations; • transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural disasters; • legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; • procurement shortages; • manufacturing difficulties; • the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; • changes in our estimated effective tax rate; • new or modified accounting regulations and practices; and • exchange rate fluctuations. Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes, and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically range in price up to approximately $6 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. 13 Table of Contents We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: • a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; • a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; • export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions which limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments; • an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate; • increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines; • technological change that we are unable to address with our products; or • a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on Our Business Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work to our advantage if Lam Research’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam Research’s equipment was previously used by a customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance. Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business. We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. 14 Table of Contents Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor’s Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to that Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment. We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 84% in fiscal year 2007, 86% in fiscal year 2006 and 84% in fiscal year 2005 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to: • trade balance issues; • economic and political conditions; • changes in currency controls; • differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; • our ability to develop relationships with local suppliers; • compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; • fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates; • the need for technical support resources in different locations; and • our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business. 15 Table of Contents Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. Political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies and will continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, in the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over- or under-hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging our yen-denominated assets with currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen, and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in other currencies. Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Income Tax Liabilities As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training, managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, such as our March 2008 acquisition of SEZ Holding AG, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, 16 Table of Contents diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. We anticipate that our recent acquisition of SEZ will give rise to risks like these, as we integrate its operations with ours. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: • general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; • global economic fluctuations; • variations in our quarterly operating results; • variations in our revenues or earnings from levels experienced by other companies in our industry or forecasts by securities analysts; • announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; • government regulations; • developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; • success or failure of our new and existing products; • liquidity of Lam Research; • disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or • political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. 17 Table of Contents We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of Our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks. However, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam Research. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property, there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. We are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm (the “Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” or the “Firm”) is required to report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2007. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam Research that, in the Firm’s professional judgment, might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with respect to us. If, for whatever reason, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of Lam Research based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations. 18 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont, California, and are held under operating leases expiring from fiscal years 2008 to 2014. These leases generally include options to renew or purchase the facilities. Please see additional information under the heading “Subsequent Events” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this 2007 Form 10-K regarding renewal of these leases and entry into additional leases. In addition, we lease properties for our service, technical support and sales personnel throughout the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific and own a manufacturing facility located in Eaton, Ohio. Our fiscal year 2007 rental payments for the space occupied during that period aggregated approximately $11 million. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases, and we believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition. Item 3.

Restructuring amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin primarily relate to the write-off of selected, older product line inventories in connection with our restructuring plans and partial recovery of the charges from the subsequent sale of a portion of such inventories. These restructuring charges/(recoveries) are included as a component of cost of goods sold in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 96-9, “Classification of Inventory Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring” (EITF 96-9). There were no restructuring charges or recoveries included in cost of goods sold in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005. Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charges consist only of additional liabilities related to prior restructuring plans. (2) Operating income during the fiscal years ended June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006 includes $35.6 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” at the beginning of fiscal year 2006. (3) Diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004 includes the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense, net of taxes, of $3.2 million has been added back to net income for computing diluted earnings per share. 23 Table of Contents Unaudited Selected Quarterly Financial Data Stock and Dividend Information: Our Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol LRCX.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2007 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2007 Form 10-K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2007 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements explains the results of the voluntary stock option review and related restatement of our financial statements. Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Subsequent Events discusses events impacting our operations that have occurred after June 24, 2007 Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements In this 2007 Form 10-K, the Company is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of June 25, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 as a result of determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review conducted by the Independent Committee. The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. This restatement is also described in the Explanatory Note to this 2007 10-K, immediately preceding Part I Item I and in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements”, to Consolidated Financial Statements. This 2007 Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Financial Data” in Item 6 for the years ended June 25, 2006, June 26, 2005, June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003. In addition, the Company is restating the unaudited quarterly condensed financial statements for interim periods of fiscal year 2006, and unaudited condensed balance sheets as of March 25, 2007, December 24, 2006 and September 24, 2006. There was no effect of the restatement on the consolidated statements of operations for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007. Financial information included in the reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed or furnished by Lam Research prior to January 24, 2008, and the related opinions of its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the Company prior to January 24, 2008 are superseded in their entirety by this 2007 Form 10-K and other reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or after January 24, 2008. Independent Committee Review On July 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary independent review regarding the timing of and accounting for the Company’s past stock option grants and other related issues. The voluntary internal review arose after the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm performed auditing procedures relating to the Company’s historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of the firm’s fiscal year-end 2007 audit. The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of two independent board members (the “Independent Committee”) to conduct a comprehensive review of the Company’s historical stock option practices. The Independent Committee promptly engaged independent outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to assist with the review. On December 21, 2007, the Company announced that the Independent Committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differed from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Upon the recommendation of management and the Independent Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Independent Committee’s review was completed in February 2008. 35 Table of Contents Scope of the Independent Committee Review The review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 (the “Review Period”). The scope of the review included evaluating 100% of “Company-wide” grants, director grants, Section 16 officer grants, and new hire grants, as well as a sampling of grants deemed “other grants”, representing approximately 94% of all stock option grants during the Review Period. This Review Period comprised approximately 16,000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500 separately recorded grant dates. These grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares of Common Stock and included grants to domestic and international employees. Share amount have been adjusted as applicable to reflect the March 2000 3-for-1 stock split. The Independent Committee’s review also included procedures to identify potential modifications of stock option grants, and grants awarded to consultants, and testing of cash exercises. The Company had not awarded any Company-wide stock option grants since October 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units (“RSUs”) thereafter. The Independent Committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that the Company only issued RSUs after fiscal year 2005 and the Company’s equity granting processes and controls had been documented and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, no information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of the review to include other periods. The Independent Committee’s review included the collection and processing of over 3.5 million electronic documents, which included hard drives and network share drives of numerous individuals, the Company’s network servers, and backup tapes. The Independent Committee’s advisors also collected and reviewed hard copy documents from numerous sources and conducted 61 interviews of 47 individuals, predominantly current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company. Stock Option Review Results Consistent with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the SEC staff, the Company organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Independent Committee’s review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, and underlying electronic data about documents. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine, for grants within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally recorded grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, in some cases resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. The significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. As a result of the findings of the review, the Company has recognized incremental stock-based compensation and associated payroll tax expense of $96.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($65.8 million after taxes) in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006 which includes incremental stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123R during fiscal year 2006. The Independent Committee also concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of Company management or the Company’s independent directors. During its review of the Company’s historical stock option practices, the Independent Committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to stock-based compensation. Company-wide Grants Company-wide grants were awarded on ten dates during the Review Period, and are associated with approximately half of the shares underlying option grants encompassed in the review. These ten dates include grants issued on six dates for broad-based and primarily discretionary grants (“focal grants”), two grant dates that were formula-based grants (“supplemental grants”) and two grant dates designed to address certain previously granted stock options for which the exercise price was higher than the then-current fair value of the Company’s Common Stock (“cancel and replace grants”). As a result of its review, the Company determined that the actual measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to determine what, if any stock-based compensation was appropriate. Any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options. With respect to the focal grants, the Company concluded that a process to determine the total number of shares underlying the options, grant date and exercise price generally commenced prior to the recorded grant date, but that in certain cases the specific allocation of those shares among the various option recipients was not finalized until after the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these option grants to a date after the original grant date, when the allocation of the shares was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $61.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. 36 Table of Contents With respect to the supplemental grants, the Company determined that the general formula for determining the number of shares underlying the option grant to which each recipient would be entitled was not sufficiently finalized for accounting purposes at the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date when this formula was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $5.6 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. The cancel and replace grants involved recipients electing to exchange certain stock options, for which the exercise price was higher than the then-current fair value of the Company’s Common Stock, in return for a new grant of options. The Company determined that in both instances, the election deadline was after the recorded grant date. The measurement date should have been the later of the recorded grant date or the date of election because the elections were revocable up to the last day of the offer period. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the last possible date of election. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $0.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. Grants to Directors and Section 16 Officers Director grants were awarded on ten dates during the stock option review period. Grants to directors were typically governed by the requirements of the underlying stock option plan documents, as grant dates and amounts were typically fixed by the respective stock option plan. There were instances when the grant dates were not consistent with dates fixed by the respective stock option plan. In all instances the grant date was within 1 to 3 days of the dates provided by the plan. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date as required by the stock option plan. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $2.8 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates. Section 16 officer grants were awarded on 23 grant dates during the stock option review period. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares. Any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options. In instances where the original recorded grant date was not consistent with the correct measurement date, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.0 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates. Additionally, it was determined that for one grant the recorded grant price was based on an average of closing prices of the Company’s stock immediately prior to the grant date. The option plan under which this option was granted allowed for similar pricing. To address this circumstance the Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million on a pre-tax basis for this grant, which was equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock on the date of grant and the originally recorded grant exercise price. Grants to Consultant The Company concluded that six granting actions to a non-employee consultant were incorrectly accounted for as employee as opposed to non-employee stock awards. To address this circumstance, the Company has recognized a stock-based compensation expense of $3.2 million on a pre-tax basis under “fair value” accounting in accordance with the requirements of EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services”. Grants to New Hires New hire grants were generally approved prior to the employee’s hire date and granted as of the last day of the month of hire prior to calendar year 1999 and on the first day of the individual’s employment with the Company beginning in calendar year 1999. In instances where approval was not evidenced on or before the original recorded grant date, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the required approval was first evidenced, but not before the employee’s hire date. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.7 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. 37 Table of Contents Other Grants For the remaining population reviewed of stock options granted during the stock option review period, the Company has concluded that certain actual measurement dates differed from the recorded grant dates primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous documentation evidencing approval as of the original recorded grant date. In these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The primary issue with these grants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the specific allocation of those shares among the various grant recipients was finalized at the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the allocation of the shares underlying the options and exercise price was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $8.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. Deemed Modifications to Stock Option Grants Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of deemed modifications to certain employee stock option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence or subsequent to their termination, thus triggering a new measurement date under the accounting literature applicable at that time. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $9.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these new measurement dates. Use of Judgment The Company evaluated all available evidence for each individual grant within the scope of the independent review and the revised measurement dates represent the earliest date when the terms of the options granted to individual recipients were known with finality. The proposed measurement date for certain grants could not be determined with certainty based on available evidence. In light of the judgment used in establishing the measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by the Company could have resulted in different stock-based compensation expense than that recorded by the Company in the restatements. While the Company has considered these alternative approaches, it believes its approach is the most appropriate under the circumstances. The Company prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that it might have recorded for these grants if it had used different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates. The Company applied its sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stock-based compensation expense within a reasonable range of possible measurement dates for each grant event. After developing the range for each grant event included in the Company’s sensitivity analysis, the Company selected the highest and lowest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range to determine the range of potential compensation expense adjustments for the grants. The Company then compared these aggregated amounts to the stock-based compensation expense that it recorded for the stock option grants analyzed. If the Company had used the highest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range for these grant events, its stock-based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have increased, net of forfeitures, by approximately $30 million on a pre-tax basis. Conversely, had the Company used the lowest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range for the grants analyzed, its stock-based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have decreased, net of forfeitures, by approximately $26 million on a pre-tax basis. Substantially all of the hypothetical increases or decreases of stock-based compensation expense resulting from the Company’s sensitivity analysis relates to periods prior to fiscal 2005. Findings and Recommendations of the Independent Committee As a result of its review, the Independent Committee identified certain deficiencies relating to the Company’s historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options, including the following areas: • Historical Board and Compensation Committee procedures regarding the issuance and approval of stock option grants; • Historical coordination among departments relating to the administration of the stock option grant process; • Historical compliance with and application of accounting standards with respect to stock option grants; • Compliance with certain of the Company’s stock option plans; and • Historical record-keeping with respect to stock option grants. As a result of the deficiencies identified, the Independent Committee developed recommendations targeted at strengthening the Company’s processes with respect to equity compensation and relating accounting. These recommendations were presented to the Board of Directors on February 1, 2008 and include the areas of: approval authority for equity compensation awards; oversight and administration of the awards process; coordination among relevant departments; training with respect to equity compensation; and record-keeping. The Company is currently reviewing all of the Independent Committee’s recommendations as well as a potential timetable for implementation, but the Company believes that the substance of many of the recommendations of the Independent Committee have already been incorporated into the Company’s current equity compensation processes. This belief is consistent with the determination by the Independent Committee and the Company that the granting of RSUs after fiscal year 2005 was not within the scope of the Independent Committee review in part due to the documentation and testing required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 38 Table of Contents The Independent Committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of Company management or the Company’s independent directors. Effect of Restatement on Consolidated Financial Statements The Company previously applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, through its fiscal year ended June 26, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual measurement date. Because certain of the Company’s options were assessed as having an exercise price below the market price on the actual measurement date based on the Company’s revised measurement dates as a result of the stock option review as more fully described above, there is a non-cash deferred compensation charge for each of these options under APB Opinion No. 25 equal to the number of shares underlying the options, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual measurement date. That deferred compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the option. The Company also recorded compensation expense under “fair value” accounting when applicable, for example, for the grants to the nonemployee consultant noted above. Commencing in its fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2006, the additional stock-based compensation expense required to be recorded for each option with a revised measurement date, as more fully described above, is equal to the fair value of the option on revised measurement date, amortized over the remaining service period of the option. The Company did not record these stock-based compensation expenses under APB Opinion No. 25 nor SFAS No. 123(R) related to its options based on the revised measurement dates in the Company’s previously issued financial statements, and that is why the Company is restating them in this filing. The Company restated its historical results of operations to record additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of (a) $94.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 26, 2005 under APB Opinion No. 25 and other applicable accounting rules, and (b) $1.2 million for the year ended June 25, 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 25, 2006, there was less than $0.1 million of remaining compensation expense to be recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) for stock options with revised measurement dates. In addition the Company recorded pre-tax payroll related tax expenses of $1.2 million through June 25, 2006. Diluted shares in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 also increased as a result of the adjustments for stock options with revised measurement dates. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted EPS calculation. As part of the restatement, the Company revised its treasury stock calculations in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”. These calculations assume that (i) all dilutive options with revised measurement dates are exercised, (ii) the Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these hypothetical exercises along with the tax benefit resulting from the hypothetical exercises, and (iii) any average unamortized deferred stock-based compensation is also used to repurchase shares. As described for each element above, the Company evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax provision. As a result, we recorded a cumulative tax benefit of $30.6 million through June 25, 2006. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. In certain jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the United States, the Company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options. In those jurisdictions, where a tax deduction is claimed, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets, totaling $6.2 million at June 25, 2006, to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the Company believes such assets to be recoverable. Based on this review, the Company now believes that it should not have taken a United States tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m). Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, the Company’s tax carryforward attributes have decreased by approximately $14.6 million as of June 25, 2006. For those stock option grants determined to have incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes and that had been originally issued as incentive stock options, or ISOs, the Company recorded a liability for payroll tax contingencies in the event such grants would not be respected as ISOs under the principles of the IRC and the regulations therein. The Company recorded expense and accrued liabilities for certain foreign payroll tax contingencies. The total payroll tax accrual was approximately $1.2 million for annual periods from our fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2006. This cumulative expense resulted from payroll tax expense recorded in prior periods has been partially offset by benefits relating to the expiration of the related statute of limitations. As a result of the restatement, the cumulative effect of the related after-tax expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 25, 2006 was $65.8 million, as compared to $96.4 million in pre-tax charges as previously discussed. These additional stock-based compensation and other expenses had no effect on the Company’s reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments for each of the restated periods. The Company has also restated the pro forma amortization of deferred stock-based employee compensation included in reported net income, net of tax, and total stock-based employee compensation expenses determined under fair value based method, net of tax, under SFAS No. 123 in Note 14, “Equity-Based Compensation Plans” to Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect the effect of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the correction of these past stock option grants. 39 Table of Contents As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K. The financial statement effect of the restatement of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll and income taxes, by year, is as follows (in thousands): Adjustment to income tax expense Adjustment to Adjustment to (benefit) relating to stock-based payroll tax stock-based Total Fiscal compensation expense compensation and restatement Year expense (benefit) payroll tax expense expense 1997 $ 1,770 $ — $ (668 ) $ 1,102 1998 2,352 226 (219 ) 2,359 1999 5,291 136 (1,286 ) 4,141 2000 19,151 1,511 (6,953 ) 13,709 2001 23,395 220 (6,792 ) 16,823 2002 13,056 159 (4,082 ) 9,133 2003 15,739 (355 ) (4,942 ) 10,442 2004 10,448 (1,061 ) (3,885 ) 5,502 Cumulative through June 27, 2004 91,202 836 (28,827 ) 63,211 2005 2,724 136 (771 ) 2,089 2006 1,225 272 (952 ) 545 Total $ 95,151 $ 1,244 $ (30,550 ) $ 65,845 40 Table of Contents The financial statement effect of the restatement on previously reported stock-based compensation expense, including income tax effect by year, is as follows (in thousands): Stock-based Income tax benefit Restated stock- compensation Stock-based relating to restated based expense, as Stock-based compensation stock-based compensation Fiscal previously compensation expense, as compensation expense, net of Year reported expense adjustments restated expense income tax 1997 $ — $ 1,770 $ 1,770 $ (668 ) $ 1,102 1998 — 2,352 2,352 (132 ) 2,220 1999 — 5,291 5,291 (1,234 ) 4,057 2000 — 19,151 19,151 (6,423 ) 12,728 2001 542 23,395 23,937 (6,961 ) 16,976 2002 1,724 13,056 14,780 (4,698 ) 10,082 2003 593 15,739 16,332 (5,116 ) 11,216 2004 3,167 10,448 13,615 (4,537 ) 9,078 Cumulative through June 27, 2004 6,026 91,202 97,228 (29,769 ) 67,459 2005 864 2,724 3,588 (1,086 ) 2,502 2006 22,768 1,225 23,993 (5,211 ) 18,782 Total $ 29,658 $ 95,151 $ 124,809 $ (36,066 ) $ 88,743 As a result of these adjustments, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of June 25, 2006 and for each of the two years in the period ended June 25, 2006 have been restated. The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported financial statements for fiscal years 1996 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. Late SEC Filings and NASDAQ Delisting Proceedings On August 27, 2007, the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of its 2007 Form 10-K, the Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On November 7, 2007, the Company received an additional letter from NASDAQ of similar substance related to its First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q. On January 14, 2008, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted the Company’s request for continued listing, provided that it filed a written summary of the Independent Committee’s findings with NASDAQ, as well as the 2007 Form 10-K and First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q on or before February 13, 2007. On February 5, 2008, the Company received an additional letter from NASDAQ stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of its Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q, the Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On February 8, 2008, the Company received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council that advised the Company that any delisting determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel had been stayed pending further review by the Review Council. The Company was given until March 28, 2008 to submit additional information to assist the Review Council in its assessment of the Company’s listing status. On February 12, 2008, the Company filed a written summary of the Independent Committee’s findings with NASDAQ. The Company believes that the filing of this 2007 Form 10-K, together with the expected filing of the First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q and the Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q, with the SEC will remediate the Company’s non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQ’s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to the Company accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with the Company’s position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the financial effect of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported, or not reported, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the Company’s Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 41 Table of Contents Costs of Restatement and Legal Activities During the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008, the Company incurred expenses totaling approximately $9.5 million for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection with the Independent Committee’s review, the Company’s own internal review and recertification procedures, the preparation of the June 24, 2007 consolidated financial statements and the restated consolidated financial statements. There were no such expenses incurred as a result of the stock option review during fiscal year 2007. Shareholder Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of government inquiries, shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We have received a letter from a stockholder demanding that our Board of Directors take certain actions, including potentially legal action, in connection with our historical stock option practices, and threatening to sue if our Board of Directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands. Our Board of Directors is currently reviewing the letter. We may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits. Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures. 42 Table of Contents Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions that typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) and demonstrates the strength of our performance throughout fiscal year 2007: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 24, March 25, December 24, September 24, June 24, 2007 2007 2006 2006 2007 Revenue $ 678,519 $ 650,270 $ 633,400 $ 604,387 $ 2,566,576 Gross margin 342,729 326,245 322,916 313,164 1,305,054 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 50.5 % 50.2 % 51.0 % 51.8 % 50.8 % Net income 170,231 164,741 167,326 183,518 685,816 Diluted net income per share $ 1.28 $ 1.15 $ 1.15 $ 1.27 $ 4.85 Our demonstrated performance and our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We are executing to the near-term production requirements of our customers, targeted to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance over the long term. Fiscal year 2007 shipments were approximately $2.6 billion. Fiscal year 2007 revenues increased 56% compared to fiscal year 2006 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with positive revenue momentum in all regions. Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 50.8% compared to fiscal year 2006 gross margin of 50.4%. Our fiscal 2007 performance is demonstrated by the significant increase in operating margin to 30.3% compared with 24.6% in fiscal year 2006, a sequential increase of 92% compared to the 56% growth in revenue. Total operating expenses increased 25% during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006, driven by discretionary investments related to our multi-product and adjacent market expansion plans. These investments included increased compensation costs as we expanded our headcount to support our growth plans during fiscal year 2007 by more than 20% to approximately 2,900 employees. Incentive-based compensation levels grew consistent with our strong performance in profitability and share price. We also invested in discretionary spending on supplies and materials to support our new product development and customer evaluation activities. Equity-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2007 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $6.4 million and $29.1 million, respectively compared to $5.4 million and $18.6 million, respectively, in the prior year. The fiscal year 2007 increase reflects the addition of our 2007 restricted stock unit focal grant which was awarded at a higher stock price than the prior year focal grant. Worthy of note is the growth in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year 2007 which more than doubled from fiscal year 2006 performance to $823.6 million representing approximately 32% of revenues, an increase of 124.2% sequentially. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Three Months Ended Year Ended June 24, March 25, December 24, September 24, June 24, 2007 2007 2006 2006 2007 Shipments (in millions) $ 694 $ 620 $ 645 $ 640 $ 2,599 During fiscal year 2007, 300 mm applications represented approximately 88% of total etch systems shipments, and 94% of etch systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nm technology node. We classify total etch systems shipments market segmentation for fiscal year 2007 as Memory at approximately 73%, Foundry at 15%, and IDM Logic/Other at 12%. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2007 were approximately $642.6 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this 2007 Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 Revenue (in thousands) $ 2,566,576 $ 1,642,171 $ 1,502,453 North America 16 % 14 % 16 % Europe 9 % 13 % 12 % Asia Pacific 18 % 12 % 19 % Taiwan 22 % 17 % 19 % Korea 21 % 22 % 19 % Japan 14 % 22 % 15 % The increase in revenues during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers and our market share expansion. We believe we gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with strong revenue performance in Taiwan, China, North America, and Korea during fiscal year 2007 and in Japan and Korea during fiscal year 2006. The increase in revenues was correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $295.5 million as of June 24, 2007 compared to $229.7 million as of June 25, 2006, as shipments outpaced revenues during fiscal year 2007. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $51 million as of June 24, 2007; these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. Gross Margin Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 1,305,054 $ 827,012 $ 763,464 Percent of total revenue 50.8 % 50.4 % 50.8 % (1) See Note 3 “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 remained greater than 50% for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 50.8% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare parts price-reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their cost-reduction roadmaps. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 was affected by the inclusion of equity-based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) of $5 million, or 0.3%. The impact of unfavorable product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes. 44 Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development (R&D) $ 285,348 $ 229,378 $ 195,289 Percent of total revenue 11.1 % 14.0 % 13.0 % (1) See Note 3 “ Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements ” to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch and our portfolio of new products. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately $22 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, new and product growth objectives, $18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $6 million in incentive-based compensation driven by higher profit levels and $6 million in equity-based compensation. Approximately 33% of fiscal year 2007 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately $19 million in increased supplies and outside services, $8 million in increased equity-based compensation expense, and $4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 241,046 $ 192,866 $ 165,832 Percent of total revenue 9.4 % 11.7 % 11.0 % (1) See Note 3 “ Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements ” to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of $20 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity-based compensation. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in incentive-based cash compensation of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long-term executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity-based compensation was approximately $8 million. Fiscal year 2005 SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the March 2005 receipt of an $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Interest income $ 71,666 $ 38,189 $ 17,537 Interest expense (17,817 ) (677 ) (1,413 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,512 ) (1,458 ) (1,175 ) Debt issue cost amortization — (368 ) — Equity method investment losses — — (205 ) Equity method investment impairment — — (445 ) Gain on sale of other investments 3,000 — — Charitable contributions (1,500 ) (1,000 ) (5,500 ) Favorable legal judgment 15,834 — — Other, net (608 ) 336 (679 ) $ 69,063 $ 35,022 $ 8,120 45 Table of Contents The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2007 and to a lesser extent, increases in interest rate yields. Although the average total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances increased throughout the year, the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007 decreased by approximately $490 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to share repurchase activity of approximately $1.1 billion throughout fiscal year 2007, of which approximately $768 million occurred during the June 2007 quarter. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 was due to the $350 million of long-term debt entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary on June 16, 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance of our long-term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007. In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity investment. The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by the Company alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of its customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. The Company’s total balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term securities, and restricted cash and investments, increased approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary’s drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the Company’s foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the AJCA. The remaining increase of $276 million was primarily driven by $367 million from cash flows from operating activities. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $161.9 million, $104.6 million and $99.0 million, in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 19.1%, 23.8% and 25.0%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2007 was due to the change in the geographical mix of income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million, or 2.5% benefit on the effective tax rate. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of the Company’s U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it pertains to the Company’s fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings. The fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to the fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate of 25.0%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the realization of state R&D tax credits not previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bilateral advanced pricing arrangement. These favorable adjustments for the year were partially offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, combined with the impact of the accounting for equity-based awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the research tax credit on December 31, 2005. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $123.3 million and $133.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $34.2 million and $27.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the utilization of tax credits, adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of income tax returns in various jurisdictions, the impact of certain elections related to foreign tax rulings, the conclusion of negotiations on certain transfer pricing items, and the incremental tax benefit related to stock-based compensation deductions. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Generally, obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. 47 Table of Contents In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R. In connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements, we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement is set forth above in “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements” and in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. 48 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we expect to decrease the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclass approximately $64.4 million from current to non-current income taxes payable. We expect the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be a $17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157 on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 159 beginning June 30, 2008 and are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R beginning in fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our consolidated financial statements. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 24, 2007, we had approximately $1.0 billion in gross cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments compared with $1.5 billion at June 25, 2006. During fiscal year 2007, we generated $823.6 million in cash from operating activities, which supported the use of $1.1 billion in stock repurchases, $177.1 million to fund the acquisition of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. (Bullen), and $100.0 million repayment of our long-term debt. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $823.6 million during fiscal year 2007 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 685.8 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 38.1 Equity-based compensation 35.6 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans 17.4 Deferred income taxes 17.1 Change in other working capital accounts 29.0 Other 0.6 $ 823.6 Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred profit of $51.1 million due to increased volume of shipments, $44.8 million in accrued expenses primarily due to increased incentive-based compensation on higher profit levels, and an increase in accounts payable of $9.1 million. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in inventories of $56.3 million on increased business volume, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $19.2 million on a pre-tax basis due to certain supply arrangement and taxes receivable. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $82.8 million and included the acquisition of Bullen assets of $177.1 million and capital expenditures of $60.0 million partially offset by the reclassification of $110.0 million from restricted cash and investments due to the repayment of $100.0 million of our long-term debt and $45.2 million in net sales of short-term investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $1.1 billion in total reflecting $1.1 billion of stock repurchases thereby completing all available share repurchase authorizations. We also made payments on our long-term debt and capital leases of $100.2 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were $60.6 million from the issuance of our Common Stock related to employee equity-based plans, and $45.0 million of excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans which represents the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 24, 2007 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 50 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include certain contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our combined contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table as of June 24, 2007: Long-term Operating Purchase Debt and Leases Obligations Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 86,543 $ 178,815 $ 13,851 $ 279,209 1-3 years 6,117 62,253 27,401 95,771 3-5 years 1,745 29,792 263,738 295,275 Over 5 years 1,743 39,273 — 41,016 Total $ 96,148 $ 310,133 $ 304,990 $ 711,271 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases less than 1 year section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease agreements. Please see additional information in “Subsequent Events” below regarding renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2007 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses and properly segregated and controlled, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 24, 2007, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $27.4 million. 51 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the LRI Credit Agreement). Under the LRI Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under the LRI Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (applicable margin) ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. LRI may prepay the loan under the LRI Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the remaining principal payment of $250 million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated based on the current LIBOR rate in effect as of June 24, 2007 of 5.320% and applicable margin of ten basis points. $100.0 million of the original $350.0 million debt was repaid during fiscal year 2007. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. Please see additional information under “Subsequent Events” below regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement. We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate a portion of the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease agreements. Please see additional information under “Subsequent Events” below for renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2007, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, LRI, as borrower, entered into the $350 million LRI Credit Agreement. In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, representing $275.0 million at June 24, 2007 as we had paid down $100.0 million of the existing debt during fiscal year 2007. This collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We obtained compliance waivers from the lender with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement. Please see additional information under “Subsequent Events” below regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement, our entry into a new credit agreement, and the entry of our wholly-owned subsidiary Bullen Semiconductor Corporation into a new guarantee agreement with respect to the new credit agreement. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 52 Table of Contents Subsequent Events SEZ Transaction: On March 11, 2008, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding shares of SEZ Holding AG (“SEZ”), the leading supplier of single-wafer clean technology and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. Upon the completion of the tender, we acquired approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of SEZ. We expect to take additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding. The tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into on December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ (the “Transaction Agreement”). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, we acquired all shares of SEZ that were tendered in the offer at a price of CHF 38 per share in cash, for a total price of CHF 606 million, which approximated US$584 million. In December 2007, we purchased a call option with a notional amount of approximately CHF 641 million to hedge the currency exposure in connection with the anticipated purchase of the shares of SEZ as noted above. The call option premium cost was $10.3 million. The mark-to-market value of the fair value of the call option as of December 23, 2007 was $3.1 million resulting in a $7.2 million unrealized loss recorded in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended December 23, 2007. In February 2008 we extended the expiration date of the call option at an additional premium cost of $2.4 million. We exercised the call option during March 2008 which resulted in a gain of $40.7 million which we will record in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ending March 30, 2008. Operating Leases: On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the “Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont Leases,” and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”). Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLC’s and our obligations will be governed by the Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the Livermore Leases are estimated to be approximately $25.7 million in the aggregate (based on one-month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into the leases), following completion of improvements to each property. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the New Fremont Leases are approximately $32.4 million in the aggregate (based upon three-month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into the leases). Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment. We are required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts with BNPPLC (or a third party, currently State Street Bank and Trust, with regard to the Livermore Leases) as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations). Under each Operating Lease and its associated documents, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash, unencumbered cash investments, and unencumbered marketable securities of at least $300.0 million (not including the collateral maintained as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases). The Operating Leases are subject to customary default provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the Operating Leases and associated documents, payment defaults under other indebtedness of us, performance defaults under the Operating Leases (including cross-defaults between each of the Operating Leases), and events of bankruptcy. In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, BNPPLC may accelerate repayment of a portion or all of its investment under the applicable Operating Leases; alternatively, BNPPLC may require us to pay all amounts due under one or more Operating Leases through the end of the term of the applicable Operating Leases. 53 Table of Contents Credit Agreements: On March 3, 2008, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the “Agent”), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders. Bullen Semiconductor Corporation, our wholly-owned domestic subsidiary(“Bullen”), entered into a guarantee (the “Bullen Guarantee”) to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we and Bullen entered into certain collateral documents (collectively, the “Collateral Documents”) including a Security Agreement by us (the “Security Agreement”), a Security Agreement by Bullen (the “Bullen Security Agreement”), a Pledge Agreement by us (the “Pledge Agreement”) and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber current and future accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets of us and Bullen, as well as 100% of our ownership interest in Bullen and 65% of our ownership interest in Lam Research International BV, our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, any future domestic subsidiaries of us will also enter into a similar guarantee and collateral documents to encumber the foregoing type of assets. Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum EBITDA). As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million) under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents. Section 409A: As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006: June 25, June 24, 2007 2006 Fiscal Year Ending June 29, June 28, June 27, June 26, June 24, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 There-after Total Fair Value Total (in thousands, except percentages) Cash equivalents Principal Amount with variable rate - Money Market Fund $ 529,968 $ 529,968 $ 529,968 730,887 Average rate 5.24 % 5.24 % 4.95 % Principal Amount with fixed rate — Securities $ — $ — 113,566 Average rate 5.10 % Short-term investment Principal Amount with fixed rate $ 30,636 $ 28,829 $ 15,761 $ 6,979 $ 8,482 $ 6,859 $ 97,546 $ 96,724 142,331 Average rate 4.68 % 4.98 % 4.69 % 5.16 % 5.07 % 4.64 % 4.85 % 4.19 % Restricted Cash/Investments Principal Amount with fixed rate — Time Deposit $ 85,038 $ 85,038 $ 85,038 Average rate 5.25 % 5.25 % Principal Amount with variable rate - Auction Rate Notes/VRDN $ 12,100 $ 1,000 $ 13,100 $ 13,096 70,575 Average rate (taxable equivalent yield) 3.87 % 5.73 % 4.24 % 5.64 % Principal Amount with fixed rate - Restricted Securities $ 50,696 $ 96,759 $ 65,231 $ 28,992 $ 16,610 $ 4,869 $ 263,157 $ 261,904 400,450 Average rate (taxable equivalent yield) 3.67 % 3.00 % 3.66 % 3.82 % 3.89 % 4.53 % 3.68 % 5.12 % Total investment securities $ 708,438 $ 126,588 $ 80,992 $ 35,971 $ 25,092 $ 11,728 $ 988,809 $ 986,730 1,457,809 Average rate 4.45 % 3.91 % 3.86 % 4.08 % 4.29 % 4.60 % 4.27 % — 4.41 % Long-term debt — Variable rate $ — $ — $ — $ 250,000 $ — $ — $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ 350,000 Average rate — — — 5.42 % — — 5.42 % — 5.65 % 54 Table of Contents The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates.

The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $30.2 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 24, 2007, was $0.1 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our balance sheet hedge forward contracts of $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $77.6 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our cash flow hedge forward contracts of $7.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Our outstanding long-term debt of $250.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the LRI Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of $250 million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. Please see additional information under “Subsequent Events” regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement. 55 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:39.307130
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past three business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has increased, and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Strengthening demand that we had noted early in fiscal 2004 and our belief that we are gaining market share manifested themselves in the progression of our quarterly revenues. We have continued to focus on our systems and service competitiveness and the implementation of strategies aimed at achieving a more variable cost structure. These efforts, combined with higher volumes, are illustrated by gross margin improvements year over year, including both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we decided to cease further investment in CMP systems development. This decision was based on the conclusion that the product did not demonstrate sufficient advantages to garner the market share necessary for adequate returns on further investment. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we repaid in full our convertible subordinated 4% notes (4% Notes), two years prior to maturity, and we settled our interest rate swap agreement (the swap) which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our fixed rate 4% Notes. 15 Table of Contents We continue to invest significantly in research and development to strengthen our product and service offerings and competitive position. Increases in operating expenses during fiscal 2004 were primarily due to a growth in salary and benefits costs, a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive-based benefits triggered by higher profits. In addition, spending increased during fiscal 2004 for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These costs have been partially offset by a decrease in facilities-related expenses as a result of infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. Total Revenue Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands) Revenue $ 935,946 $ 755,234 $ 943,114 23.9 % (19.9 %) The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared to the prior year is reflective of a market environment that has improved, evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. Signs of improvement in demand for wafer processing equipment, noted early in 2004, continued through the year. These improvements in demand as well as our belief of market share gains are evidenced by the progression of our quarterly revenues. The overall increase in our revenues is influenced by increased demand, system installation cycles and customer acceptances. Our current estimate for revenues for the September 2004 quarter is approximately $400 to $415 million. The decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 reflected our customers’ response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry, which was significantly influenced by the retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end-user demand for products servicing telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics markets. Semiconductor manufacturers selectively invested in leading-edge technology equipment through fiscal 2003. Overall, demand remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003. Based on the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”, as amended by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), “Revenue Recognition”, we generally recognize new systems revenue when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Refer to our discussion of “Critical Accounting Policies” within this document for additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Where customer acceptance provisions exist, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is typically determined based on the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications. In accordance with SAB 104, in situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. On average, revenue recognition for systems normally occurs from two to five months after the date of shipment. Spares and system upgrade revenues are generally recognized on the date of shipment, and service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customer, including training and extended warranty support. 16 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 27, June 29, June 30, 2004 2003 2002 North America 18 % 28 % 29 % Europe 19 % 20 % 21 % Asia Pacific 52 % 44 % 35 % Japan 11 % 8 % 15 % The Asia Pacific region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is located within this region; this trend has continued. The growth in Asia Pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in Taiwan and Singapore. The fiscal 2003 increase in Asia Pacific revenues reflected expanded foundry capabilities and investments by certain of our customers to support the introduction of latest-generation integrated circuit manufacturing. Gross Margin Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 431,049 $ 303,829 $ 266,089 41.9 % 14.2 % Percent of total revenue 46.1 % 40.2 % 28.2 % We have continued to focus on systems design to achieve more efficient purchasing and installation processes. Our performance is evidenced by six successive quarters’ progression of gross margin as a percent of total revenues. The increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of approximately six percentage points in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources, expense management programs, and improved sales volumes throughout the year. Fiscal 2004 gross margin includes $2.4 million of asset impairment charges related to our discontinuance of work on CMP systems development as discussed earlier in the introductory paragraph within “Results of Operations” in this section. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we recovered and recorded, in cost of goods sold, $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from unanticipated sales of certain inventories previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. We expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 50% during the September 2004 quarter. The primary objectives of our strategy to outsource manufacturing activities included a plan to avoid future fixed cost infrastructure and to achieve a more variable cost structure, by establishing transaction-based pricing agreements with vendors. In addition, we have realized opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base. Our restructuring plans, combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing and customer support operations, also contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the two most recent fiscal years. The manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes. One objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles. In this context, we had incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of $24.1 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and $5.9 million of inventory restructuring expenses. The charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time. The reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects more stability in 17 Table of Contents quarter-on-quarter business levels during the year and our continued emphasis on the minimization of costs discussed above. Approximately 5 percentage points of year-over-year improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 reflects the $38.8 million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002. In the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian). We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash and issued them a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $21.5 million. In connection with this settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million in fiscal 2002, and the remaining amount of the settlement, $2.7 million, represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received. The $2.7 million relating to the license was amortized ratably over the subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold. The $2.7 million license was fully amortized at June 27, 2004. Research and Development Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development $ 170,479 $ 160,493 $ 179,217 6.2 % (10.4 %) Percent of total revenue 18.2 % 21.3 % 19.0 % To better position ourselves competitively, we continue to invest significantly in research and development aiming at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next-generation products as well as enhancement of our existing offerings. Approximately 65% of fiscal 2004 systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The decrease in expenses as a percent of total revenues is due to increased sales volumes as our fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was nearly four times our R&D expense growth rate. The growth in spending between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $10 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive-based benefits triggered by higher profits. Approximately $2 million of the overall increase occurred throughout several categories and was due primarily to the increase in business activity. These costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities-related expenses, largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly $2 million, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. We do not expect that our decision to cease further investment in CMP systems development will have a significant impact on future R&D expense levels. Spending in fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employee-related expenses and supplies expenses of approximately $6 million, and lower infrastructure costs, principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another $6 million. Fiscal 2002 expenses included approximately $5 million related to impairment charges and write-downs in the value of selected laboratory equipment, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. The increase in R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 2003. 18 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 146,063 $ 132,820 $ 161,860 10.0 % (17.9 %) Percent of total revenue 15.6 % 17.6 % 17.2 % Significant increases in profits during fiscal 2004 supported the Company increasing employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 by nearly $12 million; a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive-based benefits triggered by higher profits. Also contributing to the fiscal 2004 SG&A expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately $5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. A decrease of approximately $4 million, primarily in depreciation expense, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above. Infrastructure rationalization and consolidation, including reduced facilities, contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. In addition, SG&A expenses in fiscal 2002 included a $4.2 million impairment charge related to the write-down in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. We expect total operating expenses will be approximately $95 million during the September 2004 quarter. Restructuring Charges We have developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry. The frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular. These dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses, including those activities within our restructuring plans, based on the best information and industry-expert forecasts available at that point in time. Although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the extreme nature of our industry’s business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective. The implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods. We systematically review our revenue outlook and forecasts and assess their impact on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing activities. Based on these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December 28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan), September 28, 2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities 19 Table of Contents have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. As of June 27, 2004, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Fiscal 2004 restructurings $ 30 $ 2,077 $ 2,107 Fiscal 2003 restructurings 183 6,451 6,634 Fiscal 2002 restructurings 389 3,496 3,885 Pre-fiscal 2002 restructurings — 1,228 1,228 Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 602 $ 13,252 $ 13,854 The severance and benefits-related costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2005. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2010. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Activities We recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8 million, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. We also recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write-off of related leasehold improvements. Furthermore, we recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities-related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal 2004. Charges during the year were partially offset by recovery of $1.5 million, net, of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold. As a result of the fiscal 2004 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $0.3 million from the March 2004 Plan, $0.7 million from the December 2003 Plan and $0.5 million from the September 2003 Plan. The majority of the savings are expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings from the Plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 27, 2004, we believe actual savings from these Plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings. March 2004 Plan We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended March 28, 2004 of approximately $3.0 million, consisting of charges for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan, deemed to be no longer useful to our operations, of $1.0 million, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements of $2.0 million. 20 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the March 2004 Plan: Abandoned Fixed Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) March 2004 provision $ 950 $ 2,088 $ 3,038 Cash payments (950 ) — (950 ) Non-cash charges — (2,088 ) (2,088 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ — $ — $ — December 2003 Plan Our December 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce by less than 20 employees, primarily in North America and by vacating a facility located in North America deemed to be no longer useful to our operations.

The employees included in the Plan were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended September 28, 2003 of approximately $1.2 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write-off of associated leasehold improvements. 21 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) September 2003 provision $ 713 $ 394 $ 123 $ 1,230 Additional restructuring charges 48 — — 48 Reversal of restructuring charges (69 ) (7 ) — (76 ) Cash payments (662 ) (353 ) — (1,015 ) Non-cash charges — — (123 ) (123 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 30 $ 34 $ — $ 64 Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities As a result of the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. The majority of the savings are expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings are primarily from lower payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual results may vary from those anticipated, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 27, 2004, we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts. However, other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and, consequently, partially or totally offset savings from these Plans. June 2003 Plan Our June 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 30 people and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended June 29, 2003, of approximately $7.6 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write-off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of the vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1.0 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $6.7 million facility-related restructuring charge. 22 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) June 2003 provision $ 783 $ 6,656 $ 210 $ 7,649 Cash payments (366 ) (388 ) — (754 ) Non-cash charges — — (210 ) (210 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 417 6,268 — 6,685 Cash payments (374 ) (847 ) — (1,221 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (37 ) (2 ) — (39 ) Additional restructuring charges — 84 — 84 Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 6 $ 5,503 $ — $ 5,509 March 2003 Plan Our March 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce in North America and Europe by approximately 50 people and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended March 30, 2003, of approximately $4.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements. We recovered $0.3 million during fiscal 2004 due to a change in estimates related to our facilities. Additionally, during fiscal 2004 $0.3 million were recovered due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the March 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) March 2003 provision $ 1,658 $ 2,913 $ 171 $ 4,742 Cash payments (855 ) (757 ) — (1,612 ) Non-cash charges (228 ) — (171 ) (399 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 575 2,156 — 2,731 Cash payments (255 ) (959 ) — (1,214 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (280 ) (283 ) — (563 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 40 $ 914 $ — $ 954 December 2002 Plan Our December 2002 Plan activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 120 employees and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe and Asia deemed to be no longer necessary for our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 65% from North America and approximately 35% from Europe and Asia locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $5.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements. During fiscal 2004 23 Table of Contents we recovered $0.1 million due to the difference between the costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement related to a facility in Japan. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2002 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) December 2002 provision $ 3,257 $ 1,945 $ 474 $ 5,676 Cash payments (3,112 ) (487 ) — (3,599 ) Non-cash charges — (49 ) (474 ) (523 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 145 1,409 — 1,554 Reversal of restructuring charges — (90 ) — (90 ) Cash payments (8 ) (1,285 ) — (1,293 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 137 $ 34 $ — $ 171 Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Activities December 2001 Plan During the second fiscal quarter of 2002, our restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by approximately 470 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia, vacating selected administrative and warehouse facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations, and the closure of certain offices in Asia. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels throughout the organization with approximately 80% from North America and approximately 20% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. During fiscal 2004, we recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due to the difference between the costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during the quarter ended March 28, 2004. During fiscal 2003, we recovered approximately $3.8 million of restructuring charges originally accrued under the December 2001 Plan, $2.1 million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and approximately $1.7 million related to a revision to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring charges of which $2.5 million were due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California and approximately $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs. The remaining $0.4 million of expenses were due to revisions we made in our estimates for employee termination costs September 2001 Plan During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, our restructuring activities included a reduction of approximately 550 employees in North America, Europe and Asia, vacating selected facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 85% from North America and 15% from Europe and Asia locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments and write-offs of leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and inventory write-downs. The inventory charge of approximately $7.6 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines. We recovered approximately $1.7 million during fiscal year 2004, $1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002, from 24 Table of Contents unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of these items. We physically disposed of approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal 2004 and $2.7 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002. During fiscal 2003, approximately $0.9 million was recovered due to lower employee severance and termination costs of $0.6 million and lower than planned expenses for vacated facility leases of $0.3 million. In addition, we recorded additional charges of $0.6 million for the September 2001 Plan based on a revised estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. During fiscal 2002, we recovered approximately $1.0 million of the September 2001 Plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than planned expenses relating to a vacated facility lease of $0.3 million. Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Plans During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, was $4.5 million, ($10.3) million and ($8.2) million in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and consisted of the following: Year Ended June 27, June 29, June 30, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Interest income $ 9,915 $ 15,804 $ 31,703 Loss on equity derivative contracts — (16,407 ) (8,236 ) Interest expense (4,634 ) (6,096 ) (26,185 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) (1,334 ) (272 ) 1,982 Debt issue cost amortization (1,593 ) (2,536 ) (3,763 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes 4,505 — — Equity method investment losses (426 ) (777 ) (835 ) Equity method investment impairment — — (2,000 ) Other, net (1,963 ) 24 (823 ) $ 4,470 $ (10,260 ) $ (8,157 ) During fiscal 2004, our total cash balances, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, increased each quarter through March 28, 2004. These increases in cash balances allowed us to repay, in the June 2004 quarter, our 4% Notes prior to maturity as discussed below. Although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year, interest income decreased during fiscal 2004 as a result of lower market rates. The decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5% $300.0 million subordinated debentures (5% Notes) in September 2002. During the quarter ended June 27, 2004, we repaid in full our 4% Notes, two years prior to maturity. The repayment of the 4% Notes resulted in a cash outlay of $303.0 million, which included a redemption premium of $3.0 million. Additionally, during the same quarter, we settled the related interest rate swap agreement (the swap) which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes. This settlement resulted in an increase in cash of $10.9 million and, in addition, a transfer of $6 million from restricted cash to cash balances. As a result of the repayment of the 4% Notes and swap settlement, we recorded a net gain of $4.5 million included in other income (expense), net. The $4.5 million consisted of a $10.9 million gain related to the swap less the $3.0 million redemption premium and write-off of $3.4 million of unamortized offering expenses associated with the 4% Notes. 25 Table of Contents The change in net other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to Lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our 5% Notes in September 2002. On August 23, 2002, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of Lam common stock at an average price of $11.19 per share for a total cash payment of $39.1 million. The settlement generated a life to date gain of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) and we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million as a result of this transaction. Based on the $13.60 market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million, from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million. This $16.4 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts’ fair value was recorded as a non-taxable loss in other expense in fiscal 2003. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was $27.7 million, ($7.9) million, and ($37.9) million, in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The losses on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 of $16.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, were non-deductible for income tax purposes. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to R&D tax credits resulting in our recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer-term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world, with our expectations of the level, timing, and sources of future revenues and profits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we increased our tax benefit rate to 30%. The increase resulted from the tax benefit of the R&D credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pre-tax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for R&D tax benefits. Deferred Tax Assets We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $303.3 million and $287.5 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $67.8 million and $36.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $26.3 million and $30.7 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Outsourcing We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to market and sell what we develop, and to service and support directly what we sell. Most other activities in the Company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities management and information technology functions. During fiscal 2003 and 2004, we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that historically occurred due to the cyclical nature of our business. 26 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. He was advanced the $1.0 million and subsequently repaid the entire amount of $1.0 million, plus accrued interest, during the quarter ended December 28, 2003. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts, system upgrade kits, and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. 27 Table of Contents Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor activities, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability improvements. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent fiscal year ended June 27, 2004, all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” (FIN 44) and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” (SFAS 148), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). Our ESPP is a non-compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Because our stock-based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded 28 Table of Contents options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion the existing option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees. Deferred Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $67.8 million relates to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, the related deferred tax asset will reverse and a portion of the valuation allowance will also be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. Off -Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include long-term liabilities and restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: Other Long-term Restructuring Operating Purchase Liabilities Liabilities Leases Obligations Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 2,500 $ 5,093 $ 13,894 $ 108,142 $ 129,629 1-3 years 730 6,986 13,718 54,750 76,184 4-5 years 62 1,748 102,034 41,498 145,342 Over 5 years — 27 388 1,825 2,240 Total $ 3,292 $ 13,854 $ 130,034 $ 206,215 $ 353,395 Other Long-Term Liabilities During the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a non-exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash, $5.0 million in December 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a three-year period. As of June 27, 2004, a total amount of $17.5 million has been paid to Varian and the total obligation remaining is $2.5 million through December 2004. 29 Table of Contents Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 27, 2004 were $13.9 million, including $0.6 million of severance and benefits-related costs and $13.3 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect $5.1 million to be paid over the next twelve months and $8.8 million to be paid between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2010. Please see the related discussion in “Restructuring Charges” within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. All of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In March and June of 2003, lease agreements relating to properties at our Fremont, California campus were transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all properties related to these leases of approximately $112.5 million. In addition, we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to $98.7 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, and the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). At the time of the June amendment, one of the leased property’s current fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1.0 million. The leased property was a building that had been part of our past restructuring activities, and the non-cash loss was recorded as a restructuring charge during fiscal 2003. As a result, we recorded a $1.0 million liability for the loss on the leased property. We maintain cash collateral of $112.5 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 27, 2004 in separate, specified interest-bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, and is therefore not consolidated by us. The $98.7 million is included in the table above. The remaining $31.3 million primarily relates to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of material contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain elements, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. These outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 27, 2004 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as Lam inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 27, 2004, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as Lam inventory were approximately $14.6 million. 30 Table of Contents Guarantees The transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our Fremont, California campus and discussed above under “Operating Leases” require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to $98.7 million (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). The remaining terms of these guarantees, four years, are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements. Under the accounting provisions of FIN 45, we recognized a liability of approximately $1.0 million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases. This liability, determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over the term of the guarantees, was recorded as prepaid rent, with the offset recorded as a liability, and the amount is being amortized to rent expense (for the prepaid rent) and to income (for the liability) on a ratable basis over the five-year period of the leases. Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements, such as, indemnification for various environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 27, 2004, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We have agreements with two financial institutions where our U.S. operating company guarantees payment of our Japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at June 27, 2004, is approximately $5.6 million, the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement. As of June 27, 2004, our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid. We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. Dollar-denominated accounts receivable generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse provisions. We insure these sold receivables for approximately 90% of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied. Based on historical payment patterns, we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore, believe the risk of loss from default is minimal. The terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the receivable, until collected. At June 27, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately $6.0 million. As of June 27, 2004, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid. Generally, we indemnify our customers, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We provide standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known factors such as the impact of system reliability improvements. See Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10K, for changes in our product warranty reserves during fiscal 2004. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 27, 2004, we had $541.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash compared with $625.9 million at June 29, 2003. Cash provided by operating activities of $157.1 million, issuance of common stock of $64.2 million and reissuance of treasury stock of $13.2 million resulted in net cash increases of $234.5 million which enabled us to repay early our 4% Notes, which resulted in a principal payment of $300.0 million. Additional significant uses of cash included capital expenditures of $24.0 million. On April 1, 2004, we settled our swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes. This settlement resulted in an increase in cash of $10.9 million and, in addition, a transfer of $6.0 million from restricted cash to cash balances. On June 7, 2004, we repaid our 4% Notes, two years prior to maturity. This repayment resulted in a cash outlay of $303.0 million, including a redemption premium of $3.0 million. Additionally, we wrote off $3.4 million of unamortized offering expenses. We had a deferred gain of $10.9 million recorded on the balance sheet, in long-term debt and other long-term liabilities, related to the swap. As a result of the settlement of the swap and the redemption of the 4% Notes, we recorded a net gain of $4.5 million included in other income, net in our statement of operations. The net gain is comprised of the deferred gain noted above, less the redemption premium, write-off of unamortized offering expenses, and transaction-related costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a non-exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash, $5.0 million in December 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a three-year period. As of June 27, 2004, a total amount of $17.5 million has been paid to Varian and the total obligation remaining is $2.5 million through December 2004. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $157.1 million in fiscal 2004, which consisted of net income for the year of $83.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $48.9 million and sources of working capital of $25.2 million. Non-cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, and the net non-cash gain recognized in fiscal 2004 as a result of the early retirement of our 4% Notes. Significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2004 include an increase of $138.4 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales volumes. We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable. These sales of accounts receivable are intended to accelerate the collection of cash. We sold $158.7 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2004. Deferred income taxes decreased by $10.9 million. Trade payables increased by $57.8 million due to increased expense levels as a result of improved business volumes and timing of payments. Accrued liabilities increased by $29.6 million primarily due to an increase in variable incentive-based compensation as well as a rise in income taxes payable as a result of the significant increase in profits. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue rose by $63.1 million, reflecting significantly increased rates of shipments and the timing of customer acceptances. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2004 was $48.5 million. We sold $66.9 million, net, of short-term investments that contributed to the repayment of our 4% Notes in June, 2004. Net capital expenditures were $24.0 million and focused on computer equipment and machinery. Net property and equipment was $42.4 million at June 27, 2004, compared to $48.8 million at June 29, 2003. This decrease is primarily due to $23.4 million of depreciation expense, $3.8 million in write-offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities, $2.4 32 Table of Contents million in write-offs related to our decision to cease investment in CMP systems development which, together, exceed the $24.0 million in capital expenditures discussed above. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $211.7 million and consisted primarily of the principal repayment of our 4% Notes in the amount of $300.0 million. In connection with the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement, we received proceeds of $10.9 million. We also reissued $13.2 million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program and net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled $64.2 million. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 27, 2004 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 33 Table of Contents Risk Factors Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: • economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically; • the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; • timing of customer acceptances of equipment; • the size and timing of orders from customers; • customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and/or acceptances; • changes in average selling prices and product mix; • our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; • our competitors’ introduction of new products; • legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; • changes in import/export regulations; • transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural disasters; • legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; • procurement shortages; • manufacturing difficulties; • the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; • new or modified accounting regulations; and • exchange rate fluctuations. Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically range in price from approximately $0.4 million to $4.8 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues may be subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. 34 Table of Contents The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: • a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; • a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; • an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; • technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and • a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. 35 Table of Contents We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment. We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we 36 Table of Contents may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non-U.S. sales, as a percentage of total revenue, accounted for approximately 82% in fiscal 2004, 72% in fiscal 2003 and 71% in fiscal 2002. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to: • trade balance issues; • regional economic and political conditions; • changes in currency controls; • differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; • ability to develop relationships with local suppliers; • compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; • fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates; and • the need for technical support resources in different locations. Many of these challenges are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia-Pacific region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training, managing, and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to 37 Table of Contents meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: • general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; • global economic fluctuations; • variations in our quarterly operating results; • variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast; • announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; • government regulations; • developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; • success or failure of our new and existing products; • disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or • political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. 38 Table of Contents We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We Have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the Rights Plan) in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals. Our Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects. Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with “interested stockholders”, as defined by that statute. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. 39 Table of Contents We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. Compliance with Internal Control Attestation and Outside Audit Firm Independence Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required, beginning with our fiscal year ending June 26, 2005, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2005. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm (Firm) will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005. We have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control. If we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations. Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the Firm and the Company that, in the Firm’s professional judgment, might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with respect to the Company. If , for whatever reason, our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of the Company based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations. 40 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio, long-term assets and long-term debt obligations at June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003: June 29, June 27, 2004 2003 There- Fair 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Total Value Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate $ 57,739 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 57,739 $ 57,739 $ 119,805 Average rate 1.20 % — — — — — 1.20 % — 1.14 % Short-term investments Fixed rate $ 59,756 $ 123,851 $ 63,330 $ 15,471 $ 601 $ — $ 263,009 $ 261,069 $ 232,718 Average rate 1.78 % 2.24 % 3.27 % 3.63 % 4.60 % — 2.47 % — 2.20 % Auction rate preferreds Variable rate $ 4,998 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 4,998 $ 5,000 $ 106,186 Average rate 1.29 % — — — — — 1.29 % — 1.48 % Restricted cash Fixed rate $ 112,468 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 112,468 $ 112,468 $ 118,468 Average rate 1.00 % — — — — — 1.00 % — 1.06 % Total investment securities $ 234,961 $ 123,851 $ 63,330 $ 15,471 $ 601 $ — $ 438,214 $ 436,276 $ 577,177 Average rate 1.25 % 2.24 % 3.27 % 3.63 % 4.60 % 1.91 % — 1.61 % Long-term debt Fixed rate $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 300,000 Average Rate — — — — — — — — 4.00 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We had no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate 4% Notes. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Japanese Yen-denominated assets. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. On June 27, 2004, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $48.1 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 27, 2004, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $8.5 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $6.2 million. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:22.530064
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) and demonstrates our strong performance and the quarter-over-quarter growth in all areas throughout fiscal year 2006: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 25, March 26, December 25, September 25, June 25, 2006 2006 2005 2005 2006 Revenue $ 525,596 $ 437,423 $ 358,245 $ 320,907 $ 1,642,171 Gross margin 274,151 219,654 177,510 156,079 827,394 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 52.2 % 50.2 % 49.5 % 48.6 % 50.4 % Net income 122,149 86,337 77,778 49,491 335,755 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.84 $ 0.60 $ 0.55 $ 0.35 $ 2.34 Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We are focused on executing to the near term production requirements of 20 Table of Contents our customers, expanding our leadership position in Etch, leveraging our Etch expertise into adjacent markets, and our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance. Customer demand increased throughout fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2006 new orders entered into backlog increased 31% compared to fiscal year 2005 with growth occurring in all regions as a function of the increase in customer demand. Fiscal year 2006 revenues, derived from our shipment levels and installation and acceptance timelines, increased 9% compared to fiscal year 2005 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with the strongest geographic momentum in Japan and Korea. Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the second consecutive year. Fiscal year 2006 quarterly gross margin as a percent of revenues showed steady growth on increasing volume. Total operating expenses increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005, primarily driven by increases in discretionary R&D spending consistent with our product and market expansion plans, equity-based compensation expense, salary costs as a result of increased headcount, planned increases in employee base compensation, and employee incentive-based costs. Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included $14.2 million in restructuring charges related to prior restructuring plans. Equity-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2006 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $5.0 million and $17.8 million, respectively. Results of Operations New Orders and Backlog New orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2006 are presented in the table below. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 25, 2006 were approximately $521 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy. 21 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 25, March 26, December 25, September 25, June 25, 2006 2006 2005 2005 2006 New Orders (in millions) $ 640 $ 520 $ 403 $ 326 $ 1,889 North America 12 % 15 % 13 % 17 % 14 % Europe 16 % 15 % 12 % 15 % 15 % Asia Pacific 44 % 28 % 29 % 33 % 34 % Korea 11 % 29 % 23 % 13 % 19 % Japan 17 % 13 % 23 % 22 % 18 % Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 New Orders (in millions) $ 315 $ 315 $ 387 $ 429 $ 1,446 North America 9 % 16 % 14 % 20 % 15 % Europe 12 % 19 % 9 % 19 % 15 % Asia Pacific 35 % 29 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Korea 16 % 14 % 40 % 15 % 22 % Japan 28 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 20 % Fiscal year 2005 started with a declining trend in new orders which stabilized in the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters. The four quarters ending June 25, 2006 showed sequentially increasing demand in new orders driven by increased capital investments by our customers and our market share gains. During fiscal year 2006, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 81% of total systems new orders and 83% of total systems new orders were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nanometer technology node. We classify total systems new orders market segmentation for fiscal year 2006 as Memory at approximately 54%, IDM Logic/Other at 27% and Foundry at 19% of the total. We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 to increase 5% to 10% compared with the quarter ended June 25, 2006. This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenue $ 1,642,171 $ 1,502,453 $ 935,946 The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 reflected the improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with particularly strong geographic performance in Japan and Korea during fiscal year 2006 and the overall Asia region during fiscal year 2005. The overall Asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $229.7 million as of June 25, 2006 compared to $150.5 million at June 26, 2005, consistent with overall business volumes. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $74 million as of June 25, 2006: these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. 22 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 North America 14 % 16 % 18 % Europe 13 % 12 % 19 % Asia Pacific 29 % 38 % 42 % Korea 22 % 19 % 10 % Japan 22 % 15 % 11 % Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 ranges from $580 million to $600 million. This is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gross Margin Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 827,394 $ 764,092 $ 431,049 Percent of total revenue 50.4 % 50.9 % 46.1 % Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 remained greater than 50% for the second consecutive year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 decreased slightly, impacted by the inclusion of equity-based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) of $5.0 million, or 0.3%. The impact of product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume. We expect that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 51.5% for the quarter ending September 24, 2006. This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Research and Development Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development (R&D) $ 228,891 $ 194,115 $ 170,479 Percent of total revenue 13.9 % 12.9 % 18.2 % We invested significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch, strip and clean product and market applications. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately $19 million in increased supplies and outside services, approximately $9 million in increased equity-based compensation expense and approximately $4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Approximately 66% of fiscal year 2006 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $9 million for incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in R&D supplies expense of approximately $6 million. 23 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 192,238 $ 164,774 $ 146,063 Percent of total revenue 11.7 % 11.0 % 15.6 % The increase in SG&A expenses during the year ended June 25, 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in incentive-based cash compensation of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long-term executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity-based compensation was approximately $9 million. Fiscal year 2005 SG&A expenses were lower due to the March 2005 receipt of an $8 million tax refund noted below. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10 million in professional services which included, among other items, expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately $3 million in equity-based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Interest income $ 38,189 $ 17,537 $ 9,915 Interest expense (677 ) (1,413 ) (4,634 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,458 ) (1,175 ) (1,334 ) Debt issue cost amortization (368 ) — (1,593 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes — — 4,505 Equity method investment losses — (205 ) (426 ) Equity method investment impairment — (445 ) — Charitable contributions (1,000 ) (5,500 ) (1,000 ) Other, net 336 (679 ) (963 ) $ 35,022 $ 8,120 $ 4,470 The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. During fiscal year 2006, average interest rate yields on the Company’s portfolio increased approximately 170 basis points compared to fiscal year 2005. The Company’s total balances of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments, increased approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary’s drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the Company’s foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The remaining increase of $276 million was primarily driven by $361 million from cash flows from operating activities. 24 Table of Contents The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated $300.0 million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004. Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $105.5 million, $99.8 million, and $27.7 million, in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 23.9%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006, excluding the discrete event discussed below, was 18.4%. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2006 related to the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the realization of state R&D tax credits not previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bi-lateral advanced pricing arrangement. These favorable adjustments for the year were offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, combined with the impact of the accounting for equity-based awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the research tax credit on December 31, 2005. The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25.0%, which primarily reflects the impact of R&D tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to income tax expense, during fiscal year 2004. Deferred Income Taxes We had gross deferred tax assets, related primarily to reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible, and tax credit carryforwards of $119.2 million and $142.1 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $27.0 million and $22.2 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), the additional tax benefit associated with the accumulated stock award attributes is not recognized until the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. As such, we have elected to net our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25). We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only realize these attributes in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS 123(R). These additional tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards were $125.2 million and $106.0 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. During fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. Subsequent Events On July 12, 2006, the Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. As a result of the denied review, the prior rulings from the trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of Lam of approximately $15.8 million, which includes approximately $2.0 million in post-judgment interest. We plan to record this amount in other income (expense), net during the quarter ending September 24, 2006. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market 26 Table of Contents conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans: Beginning on June 27, 2005 we account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we accounted for our ESPP and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation”. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS123(R). Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. 27 Table of Contents We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.” Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 25, 2006, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments compared with $894.3 million at June 26, 2005. We entered into long-term debt of $350.0 million during fiscal year 2006 to provide sufficient liquidity to support our foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The remaining increase of $276.1 million was derived from cash flows from operating activities of $360.7 million, issuance of common stock from employee equity-based plans of $194.6 million, partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2 million and capital expenditures and purchases of intangible assets of $42.1 million. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $360.7 million during fiscal year 2006 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 335.8 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 22.0 Equity-based compensation 22.8 Other, net 2.3 Income tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans 27.8 Excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans (17.8 ) Decrease in deferred tax assets 27.7 Change in other working capital accounts (59.9 ) $ 360.7 28 Table of Contents Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $175.3 million and $58.7 million, respectively, due to the increased volume of business. These changes were partially offset by an increase in deferred profit of $50.4 million due to increased volume of shipments, an increase in accounts payable of $48.3 million, and increases in accrued liabilities of $88.4 million primarily due to VAT and income taxes payable related to higher profit levels, and an increase in accrued compensation based on incentive-based compensation. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $244.3 million and consisted of a transfer to restricted cash and investments of $385.0 million due to our guarantee agreement related to the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary under the $350.0 million credit agreement entered into during the quarter ended June 25, 2006. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. In addition, we purchased $42.1 million for capital expenditures, consisting primarily of engineering equipment, and the purchase of intangible assets of intellectual property. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the net sales of short-term investments of $182.8 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $310.7 million consisting of $350.0 million from the issuance of long-term debt, $194.6 million from the issuance of our common stock related to employee equity-based plans, and $17.8 million of excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation plans, partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2 million. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares of common stock at a total price of $251.2 million under Board authorized repurchase programs which run through September 30, 2008. As of June 25, 2006 the total amount remaining available for repurchase under Board authorizations was $331.7 million. We expect to continue to repurchase shares consistent with the Board authorizations, the level of which will be determined by, including but not limited to, the needs of the business and the stock price and daily trading volumes of our stock. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 25, 2006 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities and long-term debt which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: 29 Table of Contents Long-term Operating Purchase Restructuring Debt and Leases Obligations Liabilities Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 14,821 $ 154,482 $ 1,590 $ 20,050 $ 190,943 1-3 years 86,613 42,905 — 40,209 169,727 4-5 years 2,142 8,306 — 390,044 400,492 Over 5 years 2,175 — — — 2,175 Total $ 105,751 $ 205,693 $ 1,590 $ 450,303 $ 763,337 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases 1-3 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 25, 2006 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 25, 2006, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory increased to $31.1 million compared to $14.8 million at June 26, 2005, due to the increased volume of our business. Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 25, 2006 were $1.6 million, which consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect the remaining balance to be paid over the next twelve months. 30 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the principal payment of $350 million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated based on the current LIBOR rate of 5.5% and initial spread of ten basis points. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). We have now completed our repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 25, 2006, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by LRI noted above, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, representing $385.0 million at June 25, 2006. This collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005: June 26, June 25, 2006 2005 Fiscal Year Ending June 24, June 29, June 28, June 27, June 26, There- Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After Total Value Total (in thousands, except percentages) Cash equivalents Variable rate $ 730,887 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 730,887 $ 730,887 $ — Average rate 4.95 % — — — — — 4.95 % — — Fixed rate $ 113,566 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 113,566 $ 113,509 $ 378,183 Average rate 5.10 % — — — — — 5.10 % — 3.05 % Short-term investments Fixed rate $ 42,125 $ 25,411 $ 31,346 $ 23,819 $ 6,760 $ 12,870 $ 142,331 $ 139,524 $ 328,846 Average rate 3.86 % 3.93 % 4.43 % 4.26 % 5.14 % 4.37 % 4.19 % — 3.99 % Restricted cash and investments Variable rate $ 70,575 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 70,575 $ 70,575 $ — Average rate 5.64 % — — — — — 5.64 % — — Fixed rate $ 328,643 $ 25,395 $ 14,968 $ 4,552 $ 9,082 $ 17,810 $ 400,450 $ 399,463 $ 85,038 Average rate 5.08 % 4.94 % 5.27 % 4.83 % 5.89 % 5.66 % 5.12 % — 3.00 % Total investment securities $ 1,285,796 $ 50,806 $ 46,314 $ 28,371 $ 15,842 $ 30,680 $ 1,457,809 $ 1,453,958 $ 792,067 Average rate 4.68 % 4.44 % 4.70 % 4.35 % 5.57 % 5.12 % 4.41 % — 3.43 % Long-term debt Variable rate $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 350,000 $ — $ 350,000 $ 350,000 $ — Average rate — — — — 5.65 % — 5.65 % — — We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $23.5 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 25, 2006, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $4.1 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $3.1 million. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $193.8 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would 32 Table of Contents result in an unrealized loss of $34.2 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $25.3 million. Our outstanding long-term debt of $350.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of $350 million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt.",2023-12-30 19:20:12.927047
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2008 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2008 Form 10-K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2008 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated and standalone processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages): Three Months Ended Year Ended Year Ended June 29, March 30, December 23, September 23, June 29, June 24, 2008 2008 2007 2007 2008 2007 Revenue $ 566,160 $ 613,810 $ 610,320 $ 684,621 $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 Gross margin 234,650 287,208 307,661 343,887 1,173,406 1,305,054 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 41.4 % 46.8 % 50.4 % 50.2 % 47.4 % 50.8 % Net income 72,178 103,524 115,059 148,588 439,349 685,816 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.57 $ 0.82 $ 0.91 $ 1.18 $ 3.47 $ 4.85 Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product and process development, sales and marketing, and customer support. Although there are near-term challenges from declining customer investment levels, we continue to target to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance over the long term. Fiscal year 2008 shipments were approximately $2.4 billion. Fiscal year 2008 revenues decreased 4% compared to fiscal year 2007 revenues reflecting a reduction in customer demand in the latter portion of the year. 27 Table of Contents Gross margin as a percent of revenues was 47.4% for fiscal year 2008 and decreased sequentially compared to fiscal year 2007 gross margin of 50.8%. This reduction was primarily due to customer concentration and product mix challenges and decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer investment levels. Fiscal year 2008 operating expenses include the assumption of Section 409A employee liabilities of $43.8 million and $19.3 million of costs related to our voluntary internal stock option review. Included in operating expenses is $29.5 million from the operations of SEZ since the date of acquisition. We also continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean, and other new products and technologies. Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment levels, we are targeting the longer term benefit of our product development activities. These factors, along with decreased revenues and gross margins noted above, contributed to the fiscal 2008 operating margin decrease to 20.6% compared with 30.3% in fiscal year 2007. Our cash performance remained strong during fiscal year 2008 as our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased sequentially during fiscal year 2008 by $174.1 million after the cash acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. Cash flows from operating activities were $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008.

The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy. 28 Table of Contents Revenue Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 Revenue (in thousands) $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 $ 1,642,171 North America 17 % 16 % 14 % Europe 10 % 9 % 13 % Asia Pacific 13 % 18 % 12 % Taiwan 20 % 22 % 17 % Korea 22 % 21 % 22 % Japan 18 % 14 % 22 % The slight decrease in revenues during fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 reflects our customers’ response to balancing supply and demand in the semiconductor industry. The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers and our market share expansion. Our revenue levels are correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue balance decreased to $193.6 million as of June 29, 2008 compared to $295.5 million as of June 24, 2007, consistent with the decline in customer spending levels during fiscal year 2008. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $52 million as of June 29, 2008; these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. Gross Margin Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 1,173,406 $ 1,305,054 $ 827,012 Percent of total revenue 47.4 % 50.8 % 50.4 % Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2008 was 47.4%. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes, as well as customer concentration and product mix challenges, $12.6 million of one-time restructuring and asset impairment expenses related to the streamlining of our combined clean product group, post SEZ acquisition, and $6.4 million of expense associated with the assumption of the employee tax liabilities as a result of the determinations from our voluntary independent stock option review. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare parts price-reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their cost-reduction roadmaps. Research and Development Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development (R&D) $ 323,759 $ 285,348 $ 229,378 Percent of total revenue 13.1 % 11.1 % 14.0 % 29 Table of Contents Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment levels, given the targeted longer term benefit of our product development activities, we continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean, and new products and technologies. The fiscal year 2008 R&D expenses included approximately $14 million from the operations of SEZ. Including SEZ since March 11, 2008, the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 reflect our commitment towards our near-term and longer-term product growth objectives and included increases of approximately $22 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $9 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, and new product growth objectives, and a $3 million decrease in incentive-based compensation driven by reduced profit levels. Approximately 74% and 33% of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced over the previous two years and is reflective of our continued investments in new products and technologies. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately $22 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, new and product growth objectives, $18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $6 million in incentive-based compensation driven by higher profit levels and $6 million in equity-based compensation. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 287,992 $ 241,046 $ 192,866 Percent of total revenue 11.6 % 9.4 % 11.7 % Fiscal year 2008 SG&A expenses included approximately $15 million of SEZ SG&A expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of approximately $24 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount, including SEZ since March 11, 2008, and employee base compensation, $19 million in legal and accounting cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option review, and $3 million in equity-based compensation partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by lower profit levels. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of $20 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity-based compensation. 409A Expense As a result of the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review, we considered the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC, these options are subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Due to this, taxes and penalties are levied not on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain for exercised options. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume the tax liability of certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. The 409A liability totaled $50.2 million; $43.8 million was recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of our 2007 Form 10-K. In Process Research and Development We incurred a charge of $2.1 million related to the required expensing of in process research and development following our acquisition of SEZ which is reported in operating expenses during fiscal year 2008. There remains no additional in process research and development on our balance sheet. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the June 2008 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined clean product group (“June 2008 Plan”). These charges included severance and related benefits costs, excess facilities-related costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps. 30 Table of Contents Prior to the end of the June 2008 quarter, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions under the June 2008 Plan. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. We recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008 of approximately $19.0 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $5.5 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $0.9 million, and the write-off of related fixed assets of $1.9 million. We also recorded asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of $10.7 million. Of the total $19.0 million in charges, $12.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $6.4 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2008 consolidated statement of operations. As a result of the fiscal year 2008 restructuring activities, we expect annual savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $25 million. These estimated savings from the June 2008 Plan’s discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2008 Plan: Severance and Abandoned Benefits Facilities Fixed Assets Inventory Total (in thousands) June 2008 provision $ 5,513 $ 899 $ 1,893 $ 10,671 $ 18,976 Cash payments (927 ) — — — (927 ) Non-cash charges — — (1,893 ) (10,671 ) (12,564 ) Balance at June 29, 2008 $ 4,586 $ 899 $ — $ — $ 5,485 The severance and benefits-related costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2009. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2009. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Interest income $ 51,194 $ 71,666 $ 38,189 Interest expense (12,674 ) (17,817 ) (677 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses) 31,070 (1,512 ) (1,458 ) Debt issue cost amortization — — (368 ) Gain on sale of other investments — 3,000 — Charitable contributions (908 ) (1,500 ) (1,000 ) Favorable legal judgment — 15,834 — Other, net (1,137 ) (608 ) 336 $ 67,545 $ 69,063 $ 35,022 31 Table of Contents The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year is primarily due to decreases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2008 and to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was due to share repurchase activity of $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2007, of which $768.0 million was repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, and the acquisition of SEZ in fiscal year 2008 in the amount of $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2008 as compared with the prior year was due to a $100 million repayment on our long-term debt during the December and March quarters of fiscal year 2007 and a decline in interest rates. The balance of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of June 29, 2008 was $306.3 million. The current portion of long-term debt and capital leases was $30.2 million as of June 29, 2008. Consolidated debt and capital lease obligations increased during fiscal year 2008 as a result of the SEZ acquisition. Debt and capital lease balances related to the SEZ acquisition were $56.3 million in total with $5.2 million representing the current portion as of June 29, 2008. The debt obligations consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating needs and capital leases reflect building lease obligations. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 as compared with fiscal year 2006 was due to the $350 million of long-term debt entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary on June 16, 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance of our long-term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007. Included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 are gains associated with the acquisition of SEZ of $42.7 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the Swiss franc. These acquisition-related net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately $11.2 million during fiscal year 2008 which were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar weakened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro and Taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss. A description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the Risk Factors section of this 2008 Form 10-K under the heading “Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations.” In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity investment. The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $137.6 million, $161.9 million, and $104.6 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 23.9%, 19.1%, and 23.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to the application of certain foreign tax rulings, a decrease in the proportion of income in low tax jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the federal research tax credit which expired on December 31, 2007. The increase was partially offset by certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $11.6 million. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled. The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate was 19.1%, compared to the fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate of 23.8%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it pertains to our fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $173.0 million and $123.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $53.1 million and $34.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2008. There was no such valuation allowance at the end of fiscal year 2007. 32 Table of Contents Deferred tax assets increased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the accrual related to the Section 409A employee liability and the deferred tax assets from the acquisition of SEZ. The increase in deferred tax liability in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the acquisition of SEZ. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $3.4 million relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the SEZ acquisition. Any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in the SEZ acquisition will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. FIN 48 In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we decreased the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current to non-current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a $17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent 33 Table of Contents upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty : Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans : We account for our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and stock plans under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity- based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects our underlying profitability, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. We adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2008. See Note 15: “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2008 Form 10-K for further discussion. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, (“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we perform the impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our 35 Table of Contents reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by corporate headquarters. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit over its estimated remaining useful life. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our and our competitor’s market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. The value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company decreased the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million, and reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current to non-current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in an increase to the Company’s opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 of approximately $17.6 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-2 delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. We will adopt the delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 during fiscal year 2010, while all other portions of the standard will be adopted during fiscal year 2009, as required. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that fiscal year. Our financial assets and liabilities impacted by SFAS No. 157 relate primarily to derivatives, short-term investments and restricted investments balances. We do not believe there will be any material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We do not believe there will be any material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 159. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting 36 Table of Contents standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders’ equity. We are currently assessing any further impacts of SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments, including those used in hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statement disclosures. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP SFAS 142-3”). FSP SFAS 142-3 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 on our results of operations and financial condition. Liquidity and Capital Resources During fiscal year 2008 we grew our gross cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balance to $1.2 billion compared with $1.0 billion at June 24, 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we generated $590.3 million in cash from operating activities. In addition, we acquired SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired, in an all cash transaction. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 439.3 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 54.7 Equity-based compensation 42.5 Net gain on settlement of call option (33.8 ) Restructuring charges, net 19.0 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans 24.6 Deferred income taxes (26.7 ) Changes in operating asset accounts 74.0 Other (3.3 ) $ 590.3 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts , net of amounts acquired from SEZ, included the following sources of cash: a decrease in accounts receivable of $99.9 million on lower business volumes, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $80.6 million that was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation, including an accrual for the assumption of 409A liabilities of $50.2 million, and a decrease in inventories of $19.7 million on lower business volumes. These sources of cash were partially offset by decreases in deferred profit and accounts payable of $64.0 million and $40.1 million, respectively, on lower business volumes, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $22.0 million primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $495.8 million which was primarily due to our acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, our capital expenditures were $76.8 million and we purchased Swiss franc call options related to the acquisition of SEZ totaling $13.5 million. These expenditures were partially offset by net sales/maturities of investments of $18.8 million, proceeds from the settlement of the call options related to the SEZ acquisition of $47.3 million and the reclassification of restricted cash of $15.5 million. 37 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $65.8 million which was primarily due to $58.9 million of excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans representing the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized, $21.3 million from the issuance of our Common Stock related to employee equity-based plans, partially offset by $14.6 million in share repurchases related to shares withheld through net share settlements upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity compensation plans. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 29, 2008 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $109.5 million of liabilities under FIN 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15, “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Long-term Operating Capital Purchase Debt and Leases Leases Obligations Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 12,594 $ 1,864 $ 142,651 $ 38,828 $ 195,937 1-3 years 18,533 5,936 49,311 248,337 322,117 3-5 years 12,661 4,516 31,727 13,195 62,099 Over 5 years 150,243 16,697 41,054 — 207,994 Total $ 194,031 $ 29,013 $ 264,743 $ 300,360 $ 788,147 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2016. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the Operating Leases Over 5 years section of the table above is $141.8 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus and properties in Livermore, California. On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the “Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont Leases,” and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”). 38 Table of Contents Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLC’s and our obligations will be governed by the Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment. We will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts and/or eligible short-term investments as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. As of June 29, 2008, we had $129.2 million recorded as restricted cash and short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts currently outstanding on the facility. Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations). The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of SEZ. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 29, 2008 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 29, 2008, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $26.5 million. Long-Term Debt On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (“LRI”), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the “LRI Credit Agreement”). In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. The outstanding balance on the loan was repaid in full during the quarter ended March 30, 2008. Concurrent with the repayment of the LRI Credit Agreement noted above, on March 3, 2008, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the “Agent”), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders. Our wholly-owned domestic subsidiary entered into a guarantee for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiary entered into certain collateral documents (collectively, the “Collateral Documents”) including certain Security Agreements, a Pledge Agreement and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber certain current and future accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets. 39 Table of Contents Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum EBITDA). As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million) under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents. Consolidated debt obligations increased slightly as a result of the SEZ acquisition by $34.8 million of which $4.6 million represents the current portion of long-term debt and $30.2 million is classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. The debt obligations consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating needs. Our total long-term debt of $284.8 million as of June 29, 2008 includes the $250.0 million discussed above and $34.8 million from SEZ. The current portion of long-term debt was $29.6 million as of June 29, 2008. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also requires a company (the guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2008, we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 29, 2008, these securities are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Fixed Income Securities Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29,2008 are as follows: 40 Table of Contents Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Decrease of X Basis Points June 29, 2008 Rate Increase of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 150,712 $ 149,525 $ 148,341 $ 147,157 $ 145,974 $ 144,790 $ 143,605 U.S. Treasury and Agencies 40,064 39,841 39,617 39,393 39,169 38,945 38,721 Government-Sponsored Enterprises 21,744 21,539 21,333 21,127 20,921 20,715 20,509 Bank and Corporate Notes 263,750 262,929 262,108 261,288 260,467 259,646 258,825 Total $ 476,270 $ 473,834 $ 471,399 $ 468,965 $ 466,531 $ 464,096 $ 461,660 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Publicly Traded Equity Securities and Equity Mutual Funds The values of our equity investments in publicly traded equity securities and equity mutual funds are subject to equity price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded equity security and equity mutual funds as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29, 2008 are as follows: Valuation of Securities Given an X% Decrease in Stock Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an X% Price June 29, 2008 Increase in Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Equity Mutual Funds $ 2,481 $ 2,812 $ 2,977 $ 3,306 $ 3,637 $ 3,802 $ 4,133 Publicly Traded Equity Securities $ 2,542 $ 2,881 $ 3,050 $ 3,389 $ 3,728 $ 3,897 $ 4,236 Foreign Currency Derivatives We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated net assets and forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and also on U.S. dollar-denominated assets where the Euro is the functional currency. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances against the U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-denominated net receivable balances against the Euro. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of +/- 10 percent and +/- 15 percent. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. 41 Table of Contents Unrealized Gain/(Loss) as of FX Contract Change in Fair Value Given an X% Increase (+) Notional Amount June 29, 2008 / Decrease (-) in Each FX Rate +/- 10% +/- 15% (in millions) Balance sheet hedge forward contracts sold $ 80.1 $ (0.8 ) +/- $ 7.4 +/- $ 11.2 The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below.

The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. At any time a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on interest expense and a material favorable effect on interest expense with a sharp decline in interest rates. A hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt of 50 basis points would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $1.3 million per fiscal year. In addition, our long-term debt includes $3.8 million of variable rate debt based on local LIBOR rates plus a spread of 0.50% and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates.",2023-12-30 19:20:19.627711
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2009 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2009 Form 10-K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2009 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated and standalone processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical and dependent on overall world economic conditions. Recent adverse conditions in the global economy have significantly reduced customer demand for our products. While our ability to predict the demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the future is 24 Table of Contents limited, we believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures increase to meet demand for semiconductor devices. However, our visibility for shipment volumes over the next few quarters remains very limited and, as a result, we remain cautious about forecasting any significant resumption in equipment spending in the near term. The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts): Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 1,115,946 $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 Gross margin 388,734 1,173,406 1,305,054 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 34.8 % 47.4 % 50.8 % Net income/(loss) (302,148 ) 439,349 685,816 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ (2.41 ) $ 3.47 $ 4.85 Fiscal year 2009 results compared with fiscal year 2008 results reflect declines in customer demand, consistent with the deterioration in the general economic outlook and, specifically, the downturn in the semiconductor industry which has been impacted by a decline in consumer spending for electronic goods. Fiscal year 2009 shipments were approximately $1.0 billion and decreased 59% compared to fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2009 revenues decreased 55% compared to fiscal year 2008. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 34.8% for fiscal year 2009 and decreased sequentially compared to fiscal year 2008 gross margin of 47.4%. This reduction was primarily due to customer concentration, product mix, and decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand, partially offset by favorable warranty performance. Included in gross margin were charges for restructuring and asset impairments of $21.0 million and $12.6 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Fiscal year 2009 operating expenses include goodwill impairment of $96.3 million, restructuring and asset impairments of $44.5 million, a legal judgment of $4.6 million, and $3.2 million of expenses associated with the assumption of Section 409A employee liabilities. Fiscal year 2008 operating expenses include the assumption of Section 409A employee liabilities of $44.5 million and $6.4 million of restructuring and asset impairments. We continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean, and other new products and technologies. Although there are near-term pressures on business from declining customer demand, we are targeting the longer term benefits of our product development activities. These factors, along with decreasing revenues and lower gross margins noted above, contributed to the fiscal year 2009 operating loss of 25.2% compared to fiscal year 2008 operating margin of 20.6%. In both the etch and clean markets, we believe there are opportunities for market share expansion as we have placed a significant number of joint development projects and evaluation units at our customers’ locations to enable penetration of new applications while defending and growing our existing market share. We anticipate that while there are opportunities to add to our leading etch market share position, significant market share growth opportunities will be in single-wafer clean. We intend to increase the penetration of various applications at our existing single wafer clean customers, as well as at customers who will be introducing single wafer cleaners into their fabs. Our key positions of strength in single-wafer clean have historically been in the back-end-of-line foundry and logic markets, and spending for new equipment in those markets has recently been low, resulting in temporarily exacerbated reductions in revenue and market share for our equipment. When new capacity is added in the foundry and logic markets, we expect our market share will increase with our current tool of record positions. Due to the current high volume of idled capacity potentially requiring remanufacture and upgrade, we anticipate that installed base upgrade and conversion activity will represent a meaningful revenue opportunity for us over the next few years. This opportunity is particularly substantial in etch, where new technology capability is typically required to meet leading edge requirements at the next technology node. 25 Table of Contents We recently established our Reliant™ System Business in order to increase our focus on and capabilities in the refurbishment and upgrades business opportunities that we expect in etch. We have also recently added clean refurbishment and upgrades capabilities in order to support our customers’ needs in respect of the installed base of single wafer cleaners. In today’s etch market, our customers have idled equipment available for refurbishment or upgrade that has temporarily reduced the total demand for new equipment purchases at the leading edge. This is particularly the case at our memory customers. Once demand accelerates and capacity utilization rises, we anticipate that our customers’ requirements for refurbishment or upgrade will diminish and most leading edge wafer start additions will be filled by new equipment. Some older installed base tools cannot be refurbished or upgraded for reuse on the leading edge, but they can be utilized in trailing edge foundries where 300-millimeter tool sets are needed. We intend to be very active in the used 300-millimeter tool set market as it develops in the coming quarters. In this period of reduced customer spending, we have continued to make major investments in product portfolios, as we believe they represent a significant growth opportunity when the upturn comes. We do, however, remain focused on balancing the need to invest in next generation technologies with carefully managing the cash expenditures of the Company. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 28,2009 June 29,2008 Shipments (in millions) $ 976 $ 2,367 North America 16 % 16 % Europe 11 % 9 % Asia Pacific 12 % 13 % Taiwan 20 % 20 % Korea 21 % 22 % Japan 20 % 20 % Shipments for the fiscal year 2009 decreased sequentially by 59% reflecting the industry and economic environment noted above. During fiscal year 2009, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 90% of total systems shipments and 87% of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node. We classify systems shipments market segmentation for fiscal year 2009 as Memory at approximately 58%, Integrated Device Manufacturers and Logic at 21% and Foundry at 21%. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 28, 2009 were approximately $391 million and decreased from approximately $410 million as of June 29, 2008 consistent with reduced spending commitments from our customers. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this 2009 Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provisions of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Revenue Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 Revenue (in thousands) $ 1,115,946 $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 North America 15 % 17 % 16 % Europe 11 % 10 % 9 % Asia Pacific 13 % 13 % 18 % Taiwan 19 % 20 % 22 % Korea 21 % 22 % 21 % Japan 21 % 18 % 14 % 26 Table of Contents The sequential revenue decline during fiscal year 2009 reflects the industry and economic environments noted above. Our revenue levels are correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance decreased to $64.7 million as of June 28, 2009 compared to $193.6 million as of June 29, 2008, consistent with the decline in customer spending levels during fiscal year 2009. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $13 million as of June 28, 2009 compared to $52 million as of June 29, 2008. Gross Margin Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 388,734 $ 1,173,406 $ 1,305,054 Percent of total revenue 34.8 % 47.4 % 50.8 % Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2009 was 34.8%. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand, changes in our product mix, customer concentration, and $21.0 million of one-time restructuring and asset impairment expenses, partially offset by favorable warranty performance. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes, as well as customer concentration and product mix challenges, $12.6 million of one-time restructuring and asset impairment expenses related to the streamlining of our combined Clean Product Group following the acquisition of SEZ, and $6.4 million of expense associated with the assumption of the employee tax liabilities as a result of the determinations from our voluntary independent stock option review. Research and Development Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & Development (R&D) $ 288,269 $ 323,759 $ 285,348 Percent of total revenue 25.8 % 13.1 % 11.1 % We continue to make significant investments in R&D focused on plasma etch, single wafer clean and new products. The decline in R&D spending during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008, includes approximately $8 million of lower salary and benefits related to cost savings measures, $11 million in lower other employee compensation on lower profits and a $26 million decrease in outside services and supplies, partially offset by $5 million in depreciation and amortization mainly related to the inclusion of SEZ. Approximately 91% and 74% of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced over the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies. The growth in R&D spending during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 included approximately $22 million in salary and benefits costs for increases in headcount and employee base compensation, $9 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch and new product growth objectives, the inclusion of SEZ operations for approximately four months of fiscal year 2008, and a $3 million decrease in incentive-based compensation driven by reduced profit levels. 27 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) $ 233,061 $ 287,282 $ 241,046 Percent of total revenue 20.9 % 11.6 % 9.4 % The decrease in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was driven by reductions of approximately $34 million in other employee compensation as a result of lower company profitability and $7 million in salaries and benefits related to cost savings measures, $19 million in cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option reviews completed in fiscal year 2008, and $5 million in outside services and supplies, partially offset by a $7 million charge to increase the reserves against our receivables balance for distressed customers. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was driven by increases of approximately $24 million in salary and benefits costs for increases in headcount, $19 million in legal and accounting cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option review, the inclusion of SEZ operations for approximately four months, and $3 million in equity-based compensation partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by lower profit levels. Goodwill Impairment A combination of factors, including the current economic environment, a sustained decline in our market valuation and a decline in our operating results were indicators of possible impairment of our goodwill. We performed an impairment analysis and concluded, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, that the fair value of our Clean Product Group has been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $96.3 million during fiscal year 2009. The calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results. If our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our Clean Product Group, an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the June 2008 quarter, we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined Clean Product Group (“June 2008 Plan”). We incurred additional expenses under the June 2008 Plan during the quarter ended September 28, 2008. The charges during the June 2008 quarter included severance and related benefits costs, excess facilities-related costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps. The charges during the September 2008 quarter primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps. During the December 2008 quarter, we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties (“December 2008 Plan”). The charges during the December 2008 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. During the March 2009 quarter, we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities (“March 2009 Plan”). The charges during the March 2009 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. We incurred additional expenses under the March 2009 Plan during the quarter ended June 28, 2009. The charges during the June 2009 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. 28 Table of Contents Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions under the June 2008 Plan, the December 2008 Plan, and the March 2009 Plan. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to the Company and have been abandoned. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. We recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2009 of approximately $65.5 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $52.0 million, charges for the write-off of certain assets totaling $10.2 million, and charges for the present value of remaining lease payments, net of sublease income, on vacated facilities of $3.3 million. Of the total $65.5 million in charges, $21.0 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $44.5 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2009 consolidated statement of operations. We recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008 of approximately $19.0 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $5.5 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments, net of sublease income, on vacated facilities of $0.9 million, the write-off of related fixed assets of $1.9 million, and asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of $10.7 million. Of the total $19.0 million in charges, $12.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $6.4 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2008 consolidated statement of operations. As a result of the June 2008, September 2008, December 2008, March 2009, and June 2009 quarters’ restructuring activities, we expect annual savings in total expenses, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $179 million to $189 million. The estimated savings from the June 2008, December 2008, and March 2009 Plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2008 Plan: Severance andBenefits Facilities Abandoned Assets Inventory Total (in thousands) Fiscal year 2008 expense $ 5,513 $ 899 $ 1,893 $ 10,671 $ 18,976 Cash payments (927 ) — — — (927 ) Non-cash charges — — (1,893 ) (10,671 ) (12,564 ) Balance at June 29, 2008 4,586 899 — — 5,485 Fiscal year 2009 expense 12,554 — 3,395 3,067 19,016 Cash payments (13,155 ) (873 ) — — (14,028 ) Non-cash charges (3,418 ) — (3,395 ) (3,067 ) (9,880 ) Balance at June 28, 2009 $ 567 $ 26 $ — $ — $ 593 29 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2008 Plan: Severanceand Benefits Facilities AbandonedAssets Inventory Total (in thousands) Fiscal year 2009 expense $ 16,412 $ 618 $ — $ 819 $ 17,849 Cash payments (15,728 ) — — — (15,728 ) Non-cash charges — (618 ) — (819 ) (1,437 ) Balance at June 28, 2009 $ 684 $ — $ — $ — $ 684 Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the March 2009 Plan: Severanceand Benefits Facilities AbandonedAssets Inventory Total (in thousands) Fiscal year 2009 expense $ 23,038 $ 2,265 $ 3,008 $ 330 $ 28,641 Cash payments (18,647 ) (1,828 ) — — (20,475 ) Non-cash charges (466 ) — (3,008 ) (330 ) (3,804 ) Balance at June 28, 2009 $ 3,925 $ 437 $ — $ — $ 4,362 The severance and benefits-related balance is anticipated to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2010. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments, net of sublease income, on vacated buildings and is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2015. 409A Expense Following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found, under APB No. 25, to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, such taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, relating to options that might be subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million; $44.5 million was recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. We incurred $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees. We are presently discussing with the Internal Revenue Service the application of Section 409A to Company stock options. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of our 2007 Form 10-K. Legal Judgment Aspect Systems, Inc. (“Aspect”) sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed Aspect to sell certain of our legacy Autoetch and Drytek products. The case went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in December of 2008, resulting in a jury verdict in favor of Aspect. We filed an appeal from the ensuing judgment, which is now pending. We recorded the amount of the legal judgment of $4.6 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 2009. 30 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 June 24, 2007 (in thousands) Interest income $ 24,283 $ 51,194 $ 71,666 Interest expense (6,497 ) (12,674 ) (17,817 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses) 922 31,070 (1,512 ) Favorable legal judgment — — 15,834 Other, net (558 ) (2,045 ) 892 $ 18,150 $ 67,545 $ 69,063 The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in our average balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2009 and, to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was primarily related to payment of the outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million of our existing long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.C. (“ABN AMRO”) during fiscal year 2009. The sequential decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2008 as compared with fiscal year 2007 is primarily related to decreases in average balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, primarily driven by the acquisition of SEZ. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2009 as compared with the prior year was due to our $250.0 million loan payment to ABN AMRO and to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The sequential decrease in interest expense in fiscal year 2008 as compared with fiscal year 2007 is primarily related to the $100 million repayment on our long-term debt during fiscal year 2007 and a decline in interest rates. Foreign exchanges gains in fiscal year 2009 are due to forecast variances and are related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Japanese yen, Taiwanese dollar and Euro and were partially offset by $4.0 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring and were recognized in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations during the twelve months ended June 28, 2009. Included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 are gains associated with the acquisition of SEZ of $42.7 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the Swiss franc. These acquisition-related net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately $11.6 million during fiscal year 2008 which were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar weakened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro and Taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss. In fiscal year 2009, we implemented a balance sheet hedging program to manage Swiss franc, Euro and Taiwanese dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of those fluctuations on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These exposures are related to the net intercompany liability positions in these currencies. A description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the Risk Factors section of this 2009 Form 10-K under the heading “Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations.” The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in our favor during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $39.1 million, $137.6 million, and $161.9 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007 was (14.8%), 23.9%, and 19.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 is primarily due to the Company’s loss position. In fiscal year 2009 there were certain events that resulted in a net tax expense. These 31 Table of Contents events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns and the R&D credit reinstatement offset by tax expense for a change in California law, and a valuation allowance placed on certain foreign deferred tax assets. The fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate was 23.9%, compared to the fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate of 19.1%. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to the application of certain foreign tax rulings, a decrease in the proportion of income in low tax jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the federal research tax credit which expired on December 31, 2007. The increase was partially offset by certain events resulting in a net tax benefit of $11.6 million. These events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $157.0 million and $173.0 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $41.9 million and $53.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $35.5 million and $3.4 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $35.5 million relates to certain California and foreign deferred tax assets and our fiscal year 2008’s valuation allowance of $3.4 million relates to certain foreign deferred tax assets. As part of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year 2009, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain California deferred tax assets reflecting the potential impacts of the new California law related to the repeal of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election (both passed February 20, 2009, effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2011). In addition, we recorded a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets for which management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. FIN 48 In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On June 25, 2007, upon adoption of FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was reported as an increase of the beginning balance of retained earnings of approximately $17.6 million. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 32 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery, or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify title transfer, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, 33 Table of Contents finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and other stock plans under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity- based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to 34 Table of Contents earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects our underlying profitability, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority. It provides guidance on the de-recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. 35 Table of Contents The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our and our competitor’s market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. The value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 30, 2008, we adopted the required portions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of SFAS No. 157. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 currently applies to all financial assets and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. (“FSP”) 157-2, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. The delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 will be adopted by us beginning in our fiscal year ending June 27, 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active,” which clarifies the application of Statement 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP SFAS 157-3 clarifies how (1) management’s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance of FSP SFAS 157-3 is effective immediately and we adopted its provisions with respect to our financial assets and liabilities since September 28, 2008. The impact of adopting the non-delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 is more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This Statement was effective for us beginning June 30, 2008. We have not applied the fair value option to any items; therefore, the Statement did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning of fiscal year 2010. The accounting treatment of tax benefits from acquired companies will change when SFAS No. 141R becomes effective. At such time, any changes to the tax benefits associated with the valuation allowance recorded in the SEZ acquisition will be recorded through income tax expense, where currently the accounting treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price as an adjustment to goodwill. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB 51” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS 160 36 Table of Contents establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will result in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders’ equity. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 160 in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and we do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. On December 29, 2008, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement 133” (“SFAS No. 161”). There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of SFAS No. 161 which requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments, including those used in hedging activities. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP SFAS 142-3”). FSP SFAS 142-3 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,” (“FSP SFAS 157-4”), which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This FSP re-emphasizes that regardless of market conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in SFAS No. 157. This FSP clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly. The scope of this FSP does not include assets and liabilities measured under level 1 inputs. FSP SFAS 157-4 is applied prospectively to all fair value measurements where appropriate and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FSP SFAS 157-4 during the quarter ended June 28, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”). FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” to require publicly-traded companies, as defined in APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 is effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 will result in expanded disclosures but will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 115-2 and 124-2 “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” (“FSP SFAS 115-2”). This FSP amends the requirements for the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre-existing “intent and ability” indicator. Under FSP SFAS 115-2, for impaired debt securities, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security, it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Additionally, FSP SFAS 115-2 changes the presentation of other-than-temporary impairments in the income statement for those impairments attributed to credit losses. FSP SFAS 115-2 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted FSP SFAS 115-2 on March 30, 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosures required by FSP SFAS 115-2. 37 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 165, “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS No. 165”) which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. SFAS No. 165 requires the disclosure of the date at which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date, that is, whether the date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued. The provisions of SFAS No. 165 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. In accordance with SFAS No. 165, we evaluated subsequent events through August 26, 2009, the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. During the periods from June 28, 2009 to August 26, 2009, we did not have any material recognizable subsequent events. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $757.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2009 compared to $1.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2008. This decrease was primarily due to our payment of the outstanding principal balance of our long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. of $250 million during fiscal year 2009, cash used for operations of $(78.1) million, and capital expenditures of $44.3 million. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used for operating activities of $(78.1) million during fiscal year 2009 consisted of (in millions): Net loss $ (302.1 ) Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 72.4 Equity-based compensation 53.0 Goodwill impairment 96.3 Restructuring charges, net 65.5 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans (8.0 ) Deferred income taxes 30.5 Changes in operating asset accounts (95.1 ) Other 9.4 $ (78.1 ) Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following uses of cash: a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $177.3 million primarily related to decreases in taxes payable, accrued compensation and installation and warranty liabilities. Additional uses of cash included decreases in accounts payable and deferred profit. All of these changes were primarily attributable to lower business volume. These uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $152.1 million, inventories of $46.1 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.9 million, which were also primarily due to lower business volume. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2009 was $6.0 million which was primarily due to net sales/maturities of investments of $173.8 million, partially offset by a transfer of restricted cash and investments of $92.2 million, capital expenditures of $44.3 million and acquisitions of businesses of $19.5 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2009 was $(260.8) million which was primarily due to principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases of $256.0 million, which included our payment of the outstanding principal balance of our long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. of $250 million during fiscal year 2009. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based 38 Table of Contents upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 28, 2009 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $103.0 million of liabilities under FIN 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 14, “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. OperatingLeases CapitalLeases PurchaseObligations Long-termDebt andInterest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 9,945 $ 1,940 $ 103,247 $ 4,293 $ 119,425 1-3 years 14,053 3,788 66,006 19,607 103,454 3-5 years 16,276 3,560 33,819 4,030 57,685 Over 5 years 145,917 12,252 16,671 — 174,840 Total $ 186,191 $ 21,540 $ 219,743 $ 27,930 $ 455,404 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through fiscal year 2016. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the Operating Leases Over 5 years section of the table above is $141.7 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus and properties in Livermore, California. On December 18, 2007, and as amended on April 3, 2008 and July 9, 2008, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the “Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont Leases,” and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”). Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLC’s and our obligations were governed by the Construction Agreement entered into 39 Table of Contents with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January 2015. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day in January 2015. On December 1, 2008, we completed construction of one of the two Livermore properties. We completed construction on the second property on June 1, 2009. Upon completion of construction, our occupation of each Livermore property was no longer governed by its Construction Agreement, and was instead governed by the relevant Operating Lease. Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment. We are required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $164.9 million in separate interest-bearing accounts as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. As of June 28, 2009, we had $164.9 million recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts currently outstanding on the facility. Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.7 million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $164.9 million plus related indemnification or other obligations). The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of SEZ and an office equipment lease. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our obligations at June 28, 2009 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 28, 2009, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $13.4 million. Long-Term Debt During fiscal year 2009, we paid the outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million of our existing long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (“ABN AMRO”) using existing cash balances. There were no penalties 40 Table of Contents associated with the payment. In connection with the payment, the parties agreed to terminate the ABN AMRO Credit Agreement and related Collateral Documents. ABN AMRO continues to be a participant in our operating leases with BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation and continues to provide banking services to us for customary fees. Our remaining total long-term debt of $27.1 million as of June 28, 2009 is the result of obligations assumed in connection with the acquisition of SEZ, consisting of various bank loans and government subsidized technology loans supporting operating needs. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also requires a company (the guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 28, 2009, we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Warranties We offer standard warranties on our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 28, 2009, these securities are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 41 Table of Contents Fixed Income Securities Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Publicly Traded Equity Securities The values of our equity investments in publicly traded equity securities are subject to equity price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in the related countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and on net intercompany liability exposures denominated in Swiss francs, Euros and Taiwanese dollars. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. 42 Table of Contents To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances against the U.S. dollar and net intercompany liability exposures denominated in Swiss francs, Euros and Taiwanese dollars. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables also recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

We believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in our business activities. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 28, 2009 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. However, the current uncertainty in the global economic conditions and the recent disruption in credit markets have impacted customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. If the current situation deteriorates further, our business could suffer further negative impacts. 43 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:20:29.957242
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2010 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2010 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2010 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor memory and foundry manufacturers that make DRAM, flash memory, and logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in the areas of etch and single-wafer clean to develop processing solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and/or reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Adverse conditions in the global economy during 2008 and 2009 severely reduced customer demand for our products, resulting in reduced revenue and profits throughout fiscal 2009. After three quarters of net losses, we returned to profitability in the September 2009 quarter as worldwide demand for wafer fabrication equipment began to recover. Our shipments, revenue and net income increased significantly in fiscal year 2010 compared to 2009, as both industry and global economic conditions continued to improve. We expect the same to be true for calendar year 2010 versus calendar year 2009 given our current view of wafer fabrication equipment spending. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will continue to increase as our customers’ capital expenditures increase to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices. However, historically, any improvement in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment occurs at an uneven pace. Accordingly, any forecasts about demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the near term are subject to uncertainty, and we could experience significant volatility in our quarterly results of operations over the next several quarters. 24 Table of Contents The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 27,2010 June 28,2009 June 29,2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 2,133,776 $ 1,115,946 $ 2,474,911 $ 1,017,830 91.2 % $ (1,358,965 ) -54.9 % Gross margin 969,935 388,734 1,173,406 $ 581,201 149.5 % $ (784,672 ) -66.9 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 45.5 % 34.8 % 47.4 % 10.7 % -12.6 % Total operating expenses 544,525 669,977 663,975 $ (125,452 ) -18.7 % $ 6,002 0.9 % Net income (loss) 346,669 (302,148 ) 439,349 $ 648,817 214.7 % $ (741,497 ) -168.8 % Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 2.71 $ (2.41 ) $ 3.47 $ 5.12 212.4 % $ (5.88 ) -169.5 % Fiscal year 2010 results compared with fiscal year 2009 results reflect continued improvement in the global business environment and in the semiconductor industry, improved foundry fabrication utilization and an increase in the rate of next-generation DRAM and NAND technology conversions by leading memory companies. This comparison is in sharp contrast to the decline in revenue in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008, and the resulting net loss in 2009. Throughout calendar year 2009 and the first half of calendar year 2010, we maintained our investments in new product R&D to defend our market share and win new application share. Our activities also focused on improving customer productivity in our installed base by delivering continuously improved performance and lower cost of ownership. We continued to develop the operational capability to rapidly respond to short lead-time customer orders, and believe that these activities will allow us to maintain and grow our cash position over time. We believe that the total market for wafer-fabrication equipment will increase substantially in calendar year 2010 as compared to 2009 and currently anticipate year-on-year growth in our customer shipments as a result of both expansion of the market as a whole and increases in our market share. While conditions in our industry have clearly improved and we currently anticipate industry and market share growth in calendar year 2010, we cannot predict the robustness or pace of any macroeconomic recovery. The electronics and semiconductor industries remain significantly linked to growth in worldwide GDP and consumer spending. Fiscal year 2010 revenues increased 91% compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily reflecting increased system shipments driven by growth in customer demand. Fiscal year 2010 shipments were approximately $2.3 billion and increased 136% as compared to fiscal year 2009. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to increased revenue along with improved factory utilization and a more favorable product mix as well as a decrease in restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in cost of goods sold. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2010 decreased as compared to fiscal year 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring charges and asset and goodwill impairments from approximately $141 million in fiscal year 2009 to $21 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately $39 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our Internal Revenue Code Section 409A expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review as compared to a charge of $3 million in fiscal year 2009. These factors were partially offset by the restoration of employee salaries and benefits, as well as higher variable compensation expense associated with our improved profitability. Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $992 million as of June 27, 2010 compared to $758 million as of June 28, 2009. We generated approximately $351 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010, compared to net use of cash by operating activities of $78 million in fiscal year 2009. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 27, 2010 June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 Shipments (in millions) $ 2,304 $ 976 $ 2,367 North America 8 % 16 % 16 % Europe 7 % 11 % 9 % Japan 15 % 20 % 20 % Korea 27 % 21 % 22 % Taiwan 32 % 20 % 20 % Asia Pacific 11 % 12 % 13 % Shipments for fiscal year 2010 increased by 136% compared to fiscal year 2009, reflecting improvements in the industry and economic environment as noted above. Shipments for fiscal year 2009 decreased sequentially from fiscal year 2008 by 59% reflecting declines in customer demand, consistent with the deterioration in the general economy and, specifically, the downturn in the semiconductor industry which had been impacted by a decline in consumer spending for electronic goods. During fiscal year 2010, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 96% of total systems shipments and 96% of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node. During fiscal year 2009, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 90% of total systems shipments and 87% of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node. Fiscal year 2010 shipments consisted of: Memory at approximately 61%, Foundry at 29% and Integrated Device Manufacturers and Logic at 10%. Fiscal year 2009 shipments consisted of: Memory at approximately 58%, Foundry at 21%, and Integrated Device Manufacturers and Logic at 21%. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 27, 2010 were approximately $667 million and increased from approximately $391 million as of June 28, 2009 consistent with improved spending commitments from our customers. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 27, 2010 June 28, 2009 June 29, 2008 Revenue (in thousands) $ 2,133,776 $ 1,115,946 $ 2,474,911 North America 9 % 15 % 17 % Europe 6 % 11 % 10 % Japan 15 % 21 % 18 % Korea 25 % 21 % 22 % Taiwan 33 % 19 % 20 % Asia Pacific 12 % 13 % 13 % The revenue increase during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above. The revenue decline during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 reflected adverse conditions in the global economy and semiconductor industry as noted above. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a predominant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region, and the concentration of revenue within the overall Asia region increased in fiscal year 2010 as it had in fiscal year 2009. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $207.4 million as of June 27, 2010 compared to $64.7 million as of June 28, 2009, consistent with increased customer spending levels during fiscal year 2010. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer 26 Table of Contents until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $52 million as of June 27, 2010 compared to $13 million as of June 28, 2009. Gross Margin Year Ended June 27,2010 June 28,2009 June 29,2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 969,935 $ 388,734 $ 1,173,406 $ 581,201 149.5 % $ (784,672 ) -66.9 % Percent of total revenue 45.5 % 34.8 % 47.4 % 10.7 % -12.6 % The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to improved product mix and more favorable absorption from the factories. Additionally, there was a decrease in restructuring and asset impairments included in gross margin from approximately $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $3 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately $6 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our Internal Revenue Code Section 409A expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand, changes in our product mix, customer concentration, and $21 million of one-time restructuring and asset impairment expenses, partially offset by favorable warranty performance. Research and Development Year Ended June 27,2010 June 28,2009 June 29,2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development $ 320,859 $ 288,269 $ 323,759 $ 32,590 11.3 % $ (35,490 ) -11.0 % Percent of total revenue 15.0 % 25.8 % 13.1 % -10.8 % 12.7 % We continue to make significant investments in R&D focused on plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to higher other employee compensation, salaries, and benefits of $25 million, mainly as a result of stronger company profitably, and higher outside services and supplies of $5 million related to customer penetration activities. Approximately 24% and 79% of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced over the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies. The decline in R&D spending during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008, included approximately $8 million of lower salary and benefits related to cost savings measures, $11 million in lower other employee compensation on lower profits and a $26 million decrease in outside services and supplies, partially offset by $5 million in depreciation and amortization mainly related to the inclusion of the acquisition of SEZ in March 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 27,2010 June 28,2009 June 29,2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 240,942 $ 233,061 $ 287,282 $ 7,881 3.4 % $ (54,221 ) -18.9 % Percent of total revenue 11.3 % 20.9 % 11.6 % -9.6 % 9.3 % 27 Table of Contents The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was driven by increases of approximately $26 million in other employee compensation as a result of increased company profitability offset by a $9 million decline in depreciation, rent and utilities expenses primarily as a result of restructuring activities, and $7 million due to a non-recurring accounts receivable reserve recorded for specific distressed customers in fiscal year 2009. The decrease in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was driven by a reduction of approximately $34 million in other employee compensation as a result of lower company profitability, a reduction of $7 million in salaries and benefits related to cost savings measures, a reduction of $19 million in costs incurred as a result of the voluntary independent stock option review that was completed in fiscal year 2008, and a reduction of $5 million in outside services and supplies, partially offset by a $7 million charge to increase the reserves against our receivables balance for distressed customers. Goodwill Impairment During fiscal year 2009, a combination of factors, including the economic environment, a sustained decline in our market valuation, and a decline in our operating results indicated possible impairment of our goodwill. We performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the fair value of our Clean Product Group had been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $96.3 million during fiscal year 2009. No indicators of impairment resulted from our fiscal 2010 assessment. The calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results. If our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our businesses, an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During fiscal year 2008, we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges of $19.0 million related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined Clean Product Group (“June 2008 Plan”). We incurred additional expenses of $19.0 million under the June 2008 Plan during fiscal year 2009. The charges during fiscal year 2008 included severance and related benefits costs, excess facilities-related costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps. The charges during fiscal year 2009 primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a recovery of $2.2 million related primarily to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps. During fiscal year 2009, we incurred expenses of $17.8 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties (“December 2008 Plan”). The charges consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. During fiscal year 2009, we also incurred expenses of $28.6 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities (“March 2009 Plan”). The charges during fiscal year 2009 consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. The Company incurred additional expenses of $20.9 million during fiscal 2010 under the March 2009 Plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases, severance and related benefits costs, and asset impairments. In addition to charges incurred under specific restructuring plans, during fiscal year 2010 we incurred $6.0 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands. For further details related to restructuring and asset impairment, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents 409A Expense Following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found, under applicable accounting guidance, to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, relating to options that might be subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million; $44.5 million was recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. We incurred $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees. During fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409A expenses with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and California Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) resulting in a credit of $44.4 million due to the reversal of 409A liabilities. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of our 2007 Form 10-K. Legal Judgment Aspect Systems, Inc. (“Aspect”) sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed Aspect to sell certain of our legacy Autoetch and Drytek products. The case went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in December of 2008, resulting in a jury verdict in favor of Aspect. We filed an appeal from the ensuing judgment, which is now pending. We recorded the amount of the legal judgment of $4.6 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 2009. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 27,2010 June 28,2009 June 29,2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest income $ 8,598 $ 24,283 $ 51,194 $ (15,685 ) -64.6 % $ (26,911 ) -52.6 % Interest expense (994 ) (6,497 ) (12,674 ) $ (5,503 ) -84.7 % $ (6,177 ) -48.7 % Foreign exchange gain (loss) (103 ) 922 31,070 $ (1,025 ) -111.2 % $ (30,148 ) -97.0 % Other, net (2,770 ) (558 ) (2,045 ) $ (2,212 ) -396.4 % $ 1,487 72.7 % $ 4,731 $ 18,150 $ 67,545 The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in our average cash and investment balances and decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was primarily due to treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures, and principal payments on long-term debt. The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in our average balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2009 and, to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was primarily related to payment of the outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million of our existing long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.C. (“ABN AMRO”) during fiscal year 2009 The decrease in interest expense during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 as compared with the prior year was due to our $250.0 million loan payment to ABN AMRO during fiscal year 2009, principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, and to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. 29 Table of Contents Foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2009 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Japanese yen, Taiwanese dollar and Euro and were partially offset by $4.0 million of deferred net losses associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring and were recognized in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal year 2009. Included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 were gains associated with the acquisition of SEZ of $42.7 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the Swiss franc. These acquisition-related net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately $11.6 million during fiscal year 2008; these offsetting losses were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar weakened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro and Taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss. In fiscal year 2009, we implemented a balance sheet hedging program to manage Swiss franc, Euro and Taiwanese dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of those fluctuations on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These exposures are related to monetary assets and liabilities in these currencies. A description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the Risk Factors section of this report under the heading “Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations” and in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expenses increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared with 2009 as the result of increased charitable contributions and the recognition of a $0.9 million realized loss on investments due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $83.5 million, $39.1 million, and $137.6 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 was 19.4%, (14.8%), and 23.9%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 is primarily due to the increase in the Company’s income, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. tax return and decrease in Federal R&D credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2009. The fiscal year 2009 effective tax rate was (14.8%), compared to the fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate of 23.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to the Company’s loss position. In fiscal year 2009 there were certain events that resulted in a net tax expense. These events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns and the R&D credit reinstatement offset by tax expense for a change in California law, and a valuation allowance placed on certain foreign deferred tax assets. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $137.4 million and $157.0 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $36.3 million and $41.9 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $37.0 million and $35.5 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2010 and 2009 valuation allowance of $37.0 million and $35.5 million relate to certain California and foreign deferred tax assets. 30 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, we recorded an additional valuation allowance on certain California deferred tax assets reflecting the potential impacts of the California law related to the repeal of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election. We also recorded a reduction of valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income for certain foreign entities. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery, or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic 31 Table of Contents physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify title transfer, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. We reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. We eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. 32 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 14 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. 33 Table of Contents Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or failure of the Company to reach its internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) revised the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The revised guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The accounting treatment of tax benefits from acquired companies has changed under the revised guidance. Any changes to the tax benefits associated with the valuation allowances related to business combinations will be recorded through income tax expense. We adopted the revised guidance on June 29, 2009, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are to be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value. We adopted the guidance on June 29, 2009, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance to require publicly-traded companies to disclose on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. We adopted this guidance on June 29, 2009, and the adoption resulted in expanded disclosures, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”). The Codification is the single source for all authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Codification does not change GAAP and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB ratified guidance from the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multiple-element arrangements and will require companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in 34 Table of Contents the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence or other third-party evidence of the selling price. This guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We will adopt this guidance in the beginning of fiscal year 2011 and do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2009, the FASB also ratified guidance from the EITF regarding certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This guidance modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition rules to exclude (a) non-software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality. This guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We will adopt this guidance in the beginning of fiscal year 2011 and do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $991.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2010 compared to $757.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2009. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations, which was partially offset by treasury stock purchases. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $351 million during fiscal year 2010 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 346.7 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 71.4 Equity-based compensation 50.5 Restructuring charges, net 24.7 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans 0.4 Deferred income taxes 13.7 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts (159.9 ) Other 3.2 $ 350.7 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $246.7 million, inventories of $79.7 million, and prepaid and other expenses of $23.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in trade accounts payable of $71.6 million, deferred profit of $77.4 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $41.1 million. These changes in overall cash were all consistent with increased business volumes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2010 was $103.4 million which was primarily due to net purchases of investments of $78.0 million and capital expenditures of $35.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by transfer of restricted cash and investments of $13.2 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2010 was $72.7 million which was due to stock repurchases of $93.0 million and principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $21.0 million. These uses were partially offset by the following sources of cash: proceeds from the reissuance of treasury stock of $17.5 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $13.4 million, and the excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans of $10.2 million. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based 35 Table of Contents upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 27, 2010 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. If we should require additional funding we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that if we require additional funds, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that any funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts. Consistent with GAAP, some of these are recorded on our balance sheet and some are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet include our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships for operating leases, purchase obligations, and guarantees. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to long-term debt, capital leases, and off-balance sheet agreements are included in the following table. These amounts exclude $110.5 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 14, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. OperatingLeases CapitalLeases PurchaseObligations Long-termDebt andInterest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 8,012 $ 1,671 $ 128,469 $ 3,672 $ 141,824 1-3 years 9,160 3,337 59,676 3,394 75,567 3-5 years 146,045 2,746 26,649 — 175,440 Over 5 years 7,875 9,206 7,715 — 24,796 Total $ 171,092 $ 16,960 $ 222,509 $ 7,066 $ 417,627 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through fiscal year 2016. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the Operating Leases 3-5 years section of the table above is $141.7 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus and properties in Livermore, California. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of SEZ and an office equipment lease. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain 36 Table of Contents activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The table presented above contains our purchase obligations at June 27, 2010 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties that could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 27, 2010, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $33.7 million. Long-Term Debt During fiscal year 2010 we made $21.0 million in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases. During fiscal year 2009, we paid the outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million of our existing long-term debt with ABN AMRO using existing cash balances. There were no penalties associated with the payment. In connection with the payment, the parties agreed to terminate the ABN AMRO Credit Agreement and related Collateral Documents. ABN AMRO continues to be a participant in our operating leases with BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation and continues to provide banking services to us for customary fees. Our remaining total long-term debt, excluding interest, of $7.0 million as of June 27, 2010 is the result of obligations we assumed in connection with our acquisition of SEZ, consisting of various bank loans and government subsidized technology loans supporting operating needs. Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our lease agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to these indemnification obligations. As of June 27, 2010, we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services under pre-determined conditions and limitations. We seek to limit our liability for any indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these indemnities. Warranties We provide standard warranties on our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known considerations such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 27, 2010, the Company’s mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of the Company’s other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 37 Table of Contents Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain revenues denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices denominated in the related 38 Table of Contents countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure, as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs, Euros and Taiwanese dollars. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the U.S. dollar and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs, Euros and Taiwanese dollars. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 27, 2010 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

We believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in our business activities. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 27, 2010 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated 39 Table of Contents levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.",2023-12-30 19:20:27.118504
707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2011 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2011 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2011 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make DRAM, flash memory, and logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in the areas of etch and single-wafer clean processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and/or reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices. We believe that the wafer fabrication equipment market in calendar year 2011 will be similar in size to calendar year 2010 dependent on, among other things, world-wide GDP growth, consumer adoption rates for new products such as tablet devices and high-end smart phones, and our customers’ transition to more advanced technology nodes. However, historically, any improvement in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment occurs at an uneven pace. Accordingly, any forecasts about demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the near term are subject to uncertainty, and we could experience significant volatility in our quarterly results of operations over the next several quarters. 26 Table of Contents The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 28, 2011 2010 2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 3,237,693 $ 2,133,776 $ 1,115,946 $ 1,103,917 51.7 % $ 1,017,830 91.2 % Gross margin 1,497,232 969,935 388,734 $ 527,297 54.4 % $ 581,201 149.5 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 46.2 % 45.5 % 34.8 % 0.7 % 10.7 % Total operating expenses 692,947 544,525 669,977 $ 148,422 27.3 % $ (125,452 ) -18.7 % Net income (loss) 723,748 346,669 (302,148 ) $ 377,079 108.8 % $ 648,817 214.7 % Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 5.79 $ 2.71 $ (2.41 ) $ 3.08 113.7 % $ 5.12 212.4 % Fiscal year 2011 results compared with fiscal year 2010 reflect continued improvement in the global business environment and in the semiconductor industry, improved foundry fabrication utilization and an increase in the rate of next-generation DRAM and NAND technology conversions by leading memory companies. Fiscal year 2011 revenues increased 52% compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily reflecting increased system shipments driven by growth in customer demand. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased revenue along with increased factory and field utilization resulting from higher overall volume. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased as compared to fiscal year 2010. This change was primarily due to increased research and development activities and enhanced levels of sales and marketing expense associated with customer projects and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately $39 million related to the reversal of accrued liabilities due to the final settlement of matters associated with our Internal Revenue Code Section 409A expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review. Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $2.3 billion as of June 26, 2011 compared to $992 million as of June 27, 2010. We generated approximately $881 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2011, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $351 million in fiscal year 2010. The increased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2011 versus fiscal year 2010 were mainly generated from higher revenue volumes during the fiscal year. Additionally, during fiscal year 2011, the Company completed a convertible note financing and generated $836 million in net cash, which includes proceeds from warrant sales, offset by issuance fees and purchase of convertible note hedges. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 26, 2011 June 27, 2010 June 28, 2009 Shipments (in millions) $ 3,306 $ 2,304 $ 976 North America 13 % 8 % 16 % Europe 13 % 7 % 11 % Japan 13 % 15 % 20 % Korea 21 % 27 % 21 % Taiwan 23 % 32 % 20 % Asia Pacific 17 % 11 % 12 % Shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion and increased by 43% compared to fiscal year 2010. Shipments for fiscal year 2010 increased sequentially from fiscal year 2009 by 136%. The sequential growth for both fiscal years reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above. 27 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2011, applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2010, applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 96% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49%, 32% and 19% of system shipments, respectively. During fiscal year 2010, the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 61%, 29% and 10% of system shipments, respectively. In fiscal year 2011, we saw a broadening of customers, some of which added capacity above the 65 nanometer node. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 26, 2011 were approximately $641 million and decreased from approximately $667 million as of June 27, 2010. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 26, 2011 June 27, 2010 June 28, 2009 Revenue (in millions) $ 3,238 $ 2,134 $ 1,116 North America 12 % 9 % 15 % Europe 13 % 6 % 11 % Japan 13 % 15 % 21 % Korea 23 % 25 % 21 % Taiwan 24 % 33 % 19 % Asia Pacific 15 % 12 % 13 % The revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 and fiscal year 2010 compared to 2009 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $257.6 million as of June 26, 2011 compared to $207.4 million as of June 27, 2010, consistent with increased customer spending levels during fiscal year 2011. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $70 million as of June 26, 2011 compared to $52 million as of June 27, 2010. Gross Margin Year Ended June 26,2011 June 27,2010 June 28,2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 1,497,232 $ 969,935 $ 388,734 $ 527,297 54.4 % $ 581,201 149.5 % Percent of total revenue 46.2 % 45.5 % 34.8 % 0.7 % 10.7 % The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to improved product mix and more favorable absorption from the factories. Additionally, there was a decrease in restructuring and asset impairments included in gross margin from approximately $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $3 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately $6 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our Internal Revenue Code Section 409A expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review. 28 Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 26,2011 June 27,2010 June 28,2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (“R&D”) $ 373,293 $ 320,859 $ 288,269 $ 52,434 16.3 % $ 32,590 11.3 % Percent of total revenue 11.5 % 15.0 % 25.8 % -3.5 % -10.8 % We continue to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of $27 million, mainly as a result of increased headcount and stronger company profitability, and higher outside services and supplies of $19 million related to new product development. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of $25 million, mainly as a result of stronger company profitability, and higher outside services and supplies of $5 million. Approximately 30% and 24% of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced over the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 26,2011 June 27,2010 June 28,2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 308,075 $ 240,942 $ 233,061 $ 67,133 27.9 % $ 7,881 3.4 % Percent of total revenue 9.5 % 11.3 % 20.9 % -1.8 % -9.6 % The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of $44 million, mainly as a result of increased headcount and stronger company profitability, and higher outside services and supplies of $18 million for customer penetration activities. Rent and depreciation-related expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately $13 million. The increases in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately $4 million of previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers. The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was driven by increases of approximately $26 million in employee compensation as a result of increased company profitability offset by a $9 million decline in depreciation, rent and utilities expenses primarily as a result of restructuring activities, and $7 million due to a non-recurring accounts receivable reserve recorded for specific distressed customers in fiscal year 2009. Goodwill Impairment During fiscal year 2009, a combination of factors, including the economic environment, a sustained decline in our market valuation, and a decline in our operating results indicated possible impairment of our goodwill. We performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the fair value of our Clean Product Group had been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $96.3 million during fiscal year 2009. We concluded that there were no indicators of impairment as a result of our fiscal 2010 and 2011 assessments. The calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results. If our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our businesses, an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges. 29 Table of Contents Restructuring and Asset Impairments During fiscal year 2008, we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges of $19.0 million related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined Clean Product Group (“June 2008 Plan”). We incurred additional expenses of $19.0 million under the June 2008 Plan during fiscal year 2009. The charges during fiscal year 2008 and 2009 primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a recovery of $2.2 million related primarily to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps. During fiscal year 2009, we incurred expenses of $17.8 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties (“December 2008 Plan”). The charges consisted of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. During fiscal year 2009, we also incurred expenses of $28.6 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities (“March 2009 Plan”). The charges during fiscal year 2009 consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments. The Company incurred additional expenses of $20.9 million during fiscal 2010 under the March 2009 Plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases, severance and related benefits costs, and asset impairments. During fiscal year 2011 the Company incurred additional expenses of $11.8 million under the March 2009 Plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases. In addition to charges incurred under specific restructuring plans, during fiscal year 2010 we incurred $6.0 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands. For further details related to restructuring and asset impairment, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 409A Expense Following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found, under applicable accounting guidance, to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, relating to options that might be subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million; $44.5 million was recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. We incurred $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees. During fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409A expenses with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and California Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) resulting in a credit of $44.4 million due to the reversal of 409A liabilities. There were no expenses or reversals related to Section 409A during fiscal year 2011. Legal Judgment Aspect Systems, Inc. (“Aspect”) sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed Aspect to sell certain of our legacy Autoetch and Drytek products. The case went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in December of 2008, resulting in a jury verdict in favor of Aspect. We recorded the amount of the legal judgment of $4.6 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 2009 and final judgment was reached in fiscal year 2011. 30 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 26, 2011 June 27, 2010 June 28, 2009 (in thousands) Interest income $ 15,572 $ 8,598 $ 24,283 Interest expense (5,380 ) (994 ) (6,497 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) (11,085 ) (103 ) 922 Other, net (2,516 ) (2,770 ) (558 ) $ (3,409 ) $ 4,731 $ 18,150 The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields. The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in our average cash and investment balances and decreases in interest rate yields. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was due to the issuance of the $900 million convertible notes during fiscal year 2011. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2010 as compared with the prior year was due to our $250.0 million loan payment to ABN AMRO during fiscal year 2009, principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, and to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Euro, Korean Won, and Singapore dollar. Foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2009 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Japanese yen, Taiwanese dollar and Euro and were partially offset by $4.0 million of deferred net losses associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring. Other expenses during fiscal year 2011 included increases in charitable contributions and banking fees primarily related to increased business transactions. Other expenses increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared with 2009 due to increased charitable contributions and the recognition of a $0.9 million realized loss on investments due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $77.1 million, $83.5 million, and $39.1 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 was 9.6%, 19.4%, and (14.8) %, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits, and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal R&D credit. The fiscal year 2010 effective tax rate was 19.4%, compared to the fiscal year 2009 effective tax rate of (14.8)%. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the increase in the Company’s income, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. tax return and decrease in Federal R&D credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2009. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $147.2 million and $137.4 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 31 Table of Contents $31.7 million and $36.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $46.2 million and $37.0 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2011 and 2010 valuation allowance of $46.2 million and $37.0 million relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. At our fiscal year end of June 26, 2011 we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance reflecting the impact of a California law repealing the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election, effective for subsequent fiscal years. We also recorded a reduction of valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income for certain foreign entities and an increase in the current year deferred tax liabilities. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance, completed our system installation obligations, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise 32 Table of Contents released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. We reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. We eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of 33 Table of Contents grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a 34 Table of Contents potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or failure of the Company to reach its internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the FASB ratified guidance from the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multiple-element arrangements and requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence or other third-party evidence of the selling price. We adopted this guidance on June 28, 2010, on a prospective basis, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2009, the FASB also ratified guidance from the EITF regarding certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This guidance modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition rules to exclude (a) non-software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality. We adopted this 35 Table of Contents guidance on June 28, 2010, on a prospective basis, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In June 2011, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments in this standard require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Under either method, adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from OCI to net income in the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of OCI are presented. This guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of OCI, but will change the presentation of our financial statements. We will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011 compared to $991.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2010. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and net proceeds from our convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $881 million during fiscal year 2011 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 723.7 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 74.8 Equity-based compensation 53.0 Restructuring charges, net 11.6 Amortization of convertible note discount 3.6 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans 5.5 Deferred income taxes (10.7 ) Changes in operating asset and liability accounts 21.8 Other (2.3 ) $ 881.0 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following sources of cash: increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $138.1 million, accounts payable of $42.3 million, and deferred profit of $34.0 million, partially offset by the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $89.7 million, inventories of $77.5 million, and prepaid and other assets of $25.3 million. These changes in overall cash were all consistent with increased business volumes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was $479.9 million which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $353.5 million and capital expenditures of $127.5 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2011 was $527.0 million which was primarily due to net proceeds from our convertible note financing of $835.5, which includes proceeds from convertible notes and warrant sales, offset by issuance fees and purchase of convertible note hedges. Additional sources of cash provided by financing activities include net proceeds related to issuance of common stock and reissuance of treasury stock under employee equity-based plans of $33.6 million and the effect of excess tax benefits on equity based compensation of $23.3 million. This was partially offset by $211.3 million in treasury stock repurchases, $149.6 million of net prepayments for the potential purchase of treasury stock under the structured stock repurchase arrangement (see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and $4.5 million in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases. 36 Table of Contents Liquidity Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 26, 2011 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 26, 2011, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $113.6 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $164.9 million. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned 37 Table of Contents inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our obligations at June 26, 2011 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Long-Term Debt On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes,” and collectively with the “2016 Notes”, the “Notes”). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $835.5 million, which includes proceeds from convertible notes and warrant sales, offset by issuance fees and purchase of convertible note hedges. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $47.56 per share. The balance of the net proceeds of the offering is intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire other businesses, products or technologies, or to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. During fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 we made $4.5 million and $21.0 million in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. During fiscal year 2009, we paid the outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million of our existing long-term debt with ABN AMRO using existing cash balances. There were no penalties associated with the payment. In connection with the payment, the parties agreed to terminate the ABN AMRO Credit Agreement and related Collateral Documents. In addition to the convertible notes, our remaining total long-term debt, excluding interest, of $3.9 million as of June 26, 2011 consists of various bank loans and government subsidized technology loans supporting operating needs. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 26, 2011, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. 38 Table of Contents Warranties We offer standard warranties on our systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 26, 2011, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 26, 2011 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as ofJune 26, 2011 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 328,288 $ 325,971 $ 323,655 $ 321,339 $ 319,022 $ 316,706 $ 314,390 US Treasury & Agencies 8,726 8,650 8,573 8,496 8,419 8,342 8,265 Government-Sponsored Enterprises 20,058 19,994 19,931 19,868 19,805 19,742 19,679 Foreign Government Bond 1,007 1,006 1,005 1,005 1,004 1,003 1,002 Corporate Notes and Bonds 386,126 384,894 383,663 382,432 381,200 379,969 378,737 Mortgage Backed Securities — Residential 2,676 2,661 2,647 2,633 2,619 2,605 2,591 Mortgage Backed Securities — Commercial 61,924 61,526 61,127 60,729 60,330 59,931 59,533 Total $ 808,805 $ 804,702 $ 800,601 $ 796,502 $ 792,399 $ 788,298 $ 784,197 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long-Term Debt As of June 26, 2011, we had $900 million in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a carrying amount of $722 million. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall 39 Table of Contents and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. As of June 26, 2011 the carrying value of the Notes approximates fair value as interest rates on comparable debt have not changed significantly since issuance of the Notes. Our long-term debt includes $1.2 million of variable rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.875% and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates. Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain revenues denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices denominated in the related countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure, Euro-denominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities, as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs and Taiwanese dollars. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen, Euros, Swiss franc and Taiwanese dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. 40 Table of Contents The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 26, 2011 are shown in the table below.

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2012 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2012 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2012 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make DRAM, flash memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Demand for our products declined in fiscal year 2012 as semiconductor device manufacturers slowed the pace of their capacity expansions in response to weaker macroeconomic conditions impacting demand for certain semiconductor devices. In spite of the slowing pace of capacity expansion, particularly in the memory segment, our customers continued to invest in leading edge technologies over this period. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices, particularly in mobile markets, and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 2,665,192 $ 3,237,693 $ 2,133,776 $ (572,501 ) -17.7 % $ 1,103,917 51.7 % Gross margin 1,084,069 1,497,232 969,935 $ (413,163 ) -27.6 % $ 527,297 54.4 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 40.7 % 46.2 % 45.5 % -5.5 % 0.7 % Total operating expenses 846,336 692,947 544,525 $ 153,389 22.1 % $ 148,422 27.3 % Net income 168,723 723,748 346,669 $ (555,025 ) -76.7 % $ 377,079 108.8 % Diluted net income per share $ 1.35 $ 5.79 $ 2.71 $ (4.44 ) -76.7 % $ 3.08 113.7 % On June 4, 2012 we completed our acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc (“Novellus”). Results for fiscal year 2012 include Novellus operations from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue and cost synergies. Fiscal year 2012 revenues decreased 18% compared to fiscal year 2011, primarily reflecting the decrease in customer capacity investments as noted above. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily related to continued investments in next-generation research and development and the customer facing activities that surround and support it and costs associated with the Novellus acquisition and integration. 25 Table of Contents Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of June 24, 2012 compared to $2.3 billion as of June 26, 2011. This increase included the impact of $1.1 billion acquired in connection with the Novellus acquisition, offset by $773 million of share repurchases. We generated approximately $499 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $881 million in fiscal year 2011. The decreased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011 were primarily a result of lower revenue, increased investments in research and development, and costs related to the Novellus acquisition. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 Shipments (in millions) $ 2,672 $ 3,306 $ 2,304 Korea 36 % 21 % 27 % Taiwan 18 % 23 % 32 % North America 17 % 13 % 8 % Asia Pacific 11 % 17 % 11 % Japan 10 % 13 % 15 % Europe 8 % 13 % 7 % Shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately $2.7 billion and decreased by 19% compared to fiscal year 2011. Shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion and increased by 43% compared to fiscal year 2010. The decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for semiconductor equipment, especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012. The increase in shipments from fiscal year 2010 to 2011 reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments. During fiscal year 2012, applications at or below the 45 nanometer technology node were 93% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2011, applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2012 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 45%, 46% and 9% of system shipments, respectively. During fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49%, 32% and 19% of system shipments, respectively. Starting with the December 2011 quarter we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic/integrated device manufacturing category. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2012 were approximately $870 million and increased from approximately $641 million as of June 26, 2011. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 Revenue (in millions) $ 2,665 $ 3,238 $ 2,134 Korea 33 % 23 % 25 % Taiwan 18 % 24 % 33 % North America 17 % 12 % 9 % Japan 12 % 13 % 15 % Asia Pacific 11 % 15 % 12 % Europe 9 % 13 % 6 % The revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in customer capacity investments. The revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to 26 Table of Contents occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $335.4 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to $257.6 million as of June 26, 2011, due to the addition of Novellus-related activity and increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2012. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to $70 million as of June 26, 2011. Gross Margin Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 1,084,069 $ 1,497,232 $ 969,935 $ (413,163 ) -27.6 % $ 527,297 54.4 % Percent of total revenue 40.7 % 46.2 % 45.5 % -5.5 % 0.7 % The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume. Research and Development Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (“R&D”) $ 444,559 $ 373,293 $ 320,859 $ 71,266 19.1 % $ 52,434 16.3 % Percent of total revenue 16.7 % 11.5 % 15.0 % 5.2 % -3.5 % We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an $18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount, a $21 million increase in supplies, and an $11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development. Also included in our results are $11 million of Novellus-related R&D expenses that were incurred in the June 2012 quarter from acquisition date through June 24, 2012. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a $27 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and a $19 million increase in outside services and supplies related to new product development. Approximately 30% of both fiscal years 2012 and 2011 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 400,052 $ 308,075 $ 240,942 $ 91,977 29.9 % $ 67,133 27.9 % Percent of total revenue 15.0 % 9.5 % 11.3 % 5.5 % -1.8 % The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to $63 million in expenses related to the Novellus acquisition and integration and $13 million of Novellus related SG&A expenses, including $4 million of intangible asset amortization, incurred in the June 2012 quarter from acquisition date through June 24, 2012. The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a $44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and an $18 million increase in outside services and supplies for customer penetration activities. Rent and depreciation-related expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately $13 million. The increases in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately $4 million of previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During fiscal year 2012 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.9 million, consisting of a $1.7 million expense related to a decline in the market value of certain facilities partially offset by the release of $0.8 million related to a recorded obligation not realized for a previously restructured product line. During fiscal year 2011 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $11.6 million consisting 27 Table of Contents primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases. During fiscal year 2010 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $24.8 million, consisting primarily of $19.8 million of facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for certain previously restructured leases and $6.0 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands, partially offset by a recovery of $2.2 million related to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps. For further details related to restructuring and asset impairment, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 409A Expense In fiscal year 2008, following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, relating to options that might be subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million for fiscal year 2008 and an incremental $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409A expenses with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and California Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) resulting in a credit of $44.4 million due to the reversal of 409A liabilities. There were no expenses or reversals related to Section 409A during fiscal year 2011 or 2012. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 (in thousands) Interest income $ 12,141 $ 9,890 $ 8,682 Interest expense (38,962 ) (5,380 ) (994 ) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan related assets (914 ) 5,682 (84 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) (397 ) (11,085 ) (103 ) Other, net (5,183 ) (2,516 ) (2,770 ) $ (33,315 ) $ (3,409 ) $ 4,731 The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of the $900 million convertible notes during May 2011. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Euro, Korean Won, and Singapore dollar. Other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increased charitable contributions. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $35.7 million, $77.1 million, and $83.5 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was 17.5%, 9.6%, and 19.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, decrease in federal R&D tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2011, increase in non-deductible stock based compensation, and non-deductible acquisition costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits, and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal R&D tax credit. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $253.7 million and $160.6 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $285.6 million and $45.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2012 and 2011 is primarily as a result of our acquisition of Novellus. 28 Table of Contents We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2012 and 2011 valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. At our fiscal year end of June 24, 2012 we continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election. Additionally, we recorded valuation allowance related to tax assets established in purchase price accounting. We released valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income and indefinite net operating loss carryforward period in those jurisdictions. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance, completed our system installation obligations, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. We reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. We eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 30 Table of Contents We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. Beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis, we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Under the revised guidance, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments in this standard require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of OCI, but will change the presentation of our financial statements. We will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013. In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2012 and it did not have a significant impact on the results of our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012 compared to $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, which was offset by $773 million of share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $499 million during fiscal year 2012 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 168.7 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 100.8 Equity-based compensation 81.6 Restructuring charges, net 0.9 Net tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans (1.2 ) Deferred income taxes 42.4 Amortization of convertible note discount 27.0 Impairment of investment 1.7 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts 66.2 Other 10.9 $ 499.0 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in inventories of $74.0 million, accounts receivable of $66.1 million, and prepaid and other assets of $43.2 million and an increase in accounts payable of $12.1 million, partially offset by the following uses of cash: decreases in accrued liabilities of $120.0 million and deferred profit of $9.2 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $269.7 million which was primarily due to $418.7 million cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, partially offset by capital expenditures of $107.3 million and net purchases of available-for-sale securities and other investment of $52.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $692.7 million which was primarily due to $772.7 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by $55.2 million net cash settlements under structured stock repurchase arrangement (see Note 20 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans of $27.3 million. Liquidity Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 24, 2012 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 24, 2012, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $274.2 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $164.9 million. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2012 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Long-Term Debt On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes,” and collectively with the “2016 Notes”, the “Notes”). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes. In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the “2041 Notes”). The 2041 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 28.4781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $35.11 per share of common stock. During fiscal year 2012, 2011, and 2010 we made $5.3 million, $4.5 million, and $21.0 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2012, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 24, 2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $19.9 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid. Warranties We offer standard warranties on our systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 24, 2012, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as ofJune 24, 2012 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 327,596 $ 325,920 $ 324,244 $ 322,567 $ 320,891 $ 319,215 $ 317,539 US Treasury & Agencies 140,968 139,794 138,620 137,446 136,272 135,098 133,924 Government-Sponsored Enterprises 126,329 125,309 124,289 123,268 122,248 121,228 120,208 Foreign Government Bond 6,582 6,507 6,433 6,358 6,283 6,209 6,134 Corporate Notes and Bonds 781,039 776,993 772,947 768,901 764,856 760,811 756,765 Mortgage Backed Securities - Residential 26,797 26,522 26,247 25,972 25,697 25,422 25,147 Mortgage Backed Securities - Commercial 86,387 85,875 85,364 84,853 84,341 83,830 83,319 Total $ 1,495,698 $ 1,486,920 $ 1,478,144 $ 1,469,365 $ 1,460,588 $ 1,451,813 $ 1,443,036 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long-Term Debt As of June 24, 2012, we had $1.6 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $1.7 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decreasein Stock Price Fair Value as ofJune 24, 2012 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increasein Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Mutual Funds $ 13,316 $ 15,091 $ 15,979 $ 17,754 $ 19,529 $ 20,417 $ 22,193 Publicly traded equity securities $ 4,435 $ 5,026 $ 5,322 $ 5,913 $ 6,504 $ 6,800 $ 7,391 Total $ 17,751 $ 20,117 $ 21,301 $ 23,667 $ 26,033 $ 27,217 $ 29,584 34 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) Risk We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain revenues denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices denominated in the related countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure, Euro-denominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities, as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs, Taiwanese dollars, and Great British pounds. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen, Euros, Swiss franc, Taiwanese dollar, and Great British pound -denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 24, 2012 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2013 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2013 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2013 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand that necessitate adjusting spending and managing capital allocation prudently across business cycles. Today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations during any particular period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Demand for our products declined slightly in the first half of fiscal year 2013 as semiconductor device manufacturers delayed certain capacity investments. Industry conditions started to improve during the second half of fiscal year 2013 as customers increased their investments in semiconductor equipment to support healthy demand. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital 33 Table of Contents expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices, particularly in mobile markets, and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 30,2013 June 24,2012 June 26,2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 3,598,916 $ 2,665,192 $ 3,237,693 $ 933,724 35.0 % $ (572,501 ) -17.7 % Gross margin 1,403,059 1,084,069 1,497,232 $ 318,990 29.4 % $ (413,163 ) -27.6 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 39.0 % 40.7 % 46.2 % -1.7 % -5.5 % Total operating expenses 1,284,988 846,336 692,947 $ 438,652 51.8 % $ 153,389 22.1 % Net income 113,879 168,723 723,748 $ (54,844 ) -32.5 % $ (555,025 ) -76.7 % Diluted net income per share $ 0.66 $ 1.35 $ 5.79 $ (0.69 ) -51.1 % $ (4.44 ) -76.7 % On June 4, 2012 we completed our acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc (“Novellus”). Results for fiscal year 2013 include Novellus operations. Results for fiscal year 2012 include Novellus operations from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies. Fiscal year 2013 revenues increased 35% compared to fiscal year 2012, reflecting a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of Novellus. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily reflecting a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of Novellus and operating expenses related to acquired intangible asset amortization and Novellus integration costs. Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2013 compared to $3.0 billion as of June 24, 2012. This decrease was primarily the result of $956 million of share repurchases offset by $720 million in cash provided by operating activities. This compares to $499 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012. The increased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2013 versus fiscal year 2012 were primarily the result of higher revenue levels. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 30, June 24, June 26, 2013 2012 2011 Shipments (in millions) $ 3,714 $ 2,672 $ 3,306 Taiwan 29 % 18 % 23 % North America 20 % 17 % 13 % Korea 16 % 36 % 21 % Asia Pacific 16 % 11 % 17 % Japan 11 % 10 % 13 % Europe 8 % 8 % 13 % Shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately $3.7 billion and increased by 39% compared to fiscal year 2012. Shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately $2.7 billion and decreased by 19% compared to fiscal year 2011. The increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to 34 Table of Contents having a full year of combined operations with Novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013. The decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for semiconductor equipment, especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012. The percentage of total system shipments to each of the market segments we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011. In the December 2011 quarter we modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic/integrated device manufacturing category. Year Ended June 30, June 24, June 26, 2013 2012 2011 Memory 36 % 45 % 49 % Foundry 49 % 46 % 32 % Logic/integrated device manufacturing 15 % 9 % 19 % Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 30, 2013 were approximately $764 million and decreased from approximately $870 million as of June 24, 2012. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 30, June 24, June 26, 2013 2012 2011 Revenue (in millions) $ 3,599 $ 2,665 $ 3,238 Taiwan 29 % 18 % 24 % North America 20 % 17 % 12 % Korea 17 % 33 % 23 % Asia Pacific 16 % 11 % 15 % Japan 10 % 12 % 13 % Europe 8 % 9 % 13 % The revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of Novellus. The revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in customer capacity investments. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $389.2 million as of June 30, 2013 compared to $335.4 million as of June 24, 2012, due to increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2013. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $70 million as of June 30, 2013 compared to $23 million as of June 24, 2012. Gross Margin Year Ended June 30,2013 June 24,2012 June 26,2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 1,403,059 $ 1,084,069 $ 1,497,232 $ 318,990 29.4 % $ (413,163 ) -27.6 % Percent of total revenue 39.0 % 40.7 % 46.2 % -1.7 % -5.5 % 35 Table of Contents The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments of approximately $77 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $78 million, and $16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations. Offsetting these higher acquisition and product configuration related expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix. Research and Development Year Ended June 30,2013 June 24,2012 June 26,2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (“R&D”) $ 683,688 $ 444,559 $ 373,293 $ 239,129 53.8 % $ 71,266 19.1 % Percent of total revenue 19.0 % 16.7 % 11.5 % 2.3 % 5.2 % We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge plasma etch, deposition, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Fiscal year 2013 reflects a full year of combined operations with Novellus, while fiscal year 2012 reflects mainly Lam as a standalone entity. Increased R&D expense included $111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount, $46 million in supplies, $26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development, $15 million in outside services, and an additional $12 million in rent, utilities and repairs. Overall R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased as a result of technology inflections such as the transition to multi-patterning and three dimensional devices. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an $18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount, a $21 million increase in supplies, and an $11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development. Also included in our results are $11 million of Novellus-related R&D expenses that were incurred in the June 2012 quarter from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 30,2013 June 24,2012 June 26,2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 599,487 $ 400,052 $ 308,075 $ 199,435 49.9 % $ 91,977 29.9 % Percent of total revenue 16.7 % 15.0 % 9.5 % 1.7 % 5.5 % The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with Novellus. Increased expense includes $108 million in salary and benefits due to higher headcount, $73 million of intangible asset amortization, $29 million in integration cost, and $14 million in rent/repair/utilities, all offset by a $47 million decrease in acquisition-related cost. The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to $63 million in expenses related to the Novellus acquisition and integration and $13 million of Novellus related SG&A expenses, including $4 million of intangible asset amortization, incurred in the June 2012 quarter from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. 36 Table of Contents Restructuring During fiscal year 2011 we incurred restructuring charges of $11.6 million consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases. For further details related to restructuring, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 30, June 24, June 26, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Interest income $ 14,737 $ 12,141 $ 9,890 Interest expense (60,408 ) (38,962 ) (5,380 ) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan related assets 9,764 (914 ) 5,682 Foreign exchange loss (6,808 ) (397 ) (11,085 ) Other, net (8,698 ) (5,183 ) (2,516 ) $ (51,413 ) $ (33,315 ) $ (3,409 ) The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 and during fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 and during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the issuance of the $900 million convertible notes during May 2011 and the 2041 Notes assumed in June 2012 in connection with the Novellus acquisition. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2013 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Japanese yen, Korean won and Taiwanese dollar. We incurred insignificant foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 related to un-hedged balance sheet exposures. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the euro, Korean won, and Singapore dollar. Other expenses during fiscal year 2013 increased as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a $3.7 million other-than-temporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the March 2013 quarter. Other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a $1.7 million other-than temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the September 2011 quarter and increased charitable contributions. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense(benefit) was $(47.2) million, $35.7 million, and $77.1 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011 was (70.8) %, 17.5%, and 9.6%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the level of income, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapse of statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and tax benefit due to the 37 Table of Contents retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in January 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, decrease in federal research and development tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2011, increase in non-deductible stock based compensation, and non-deductible acquisition costs. International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $317.8 million and $253.7 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $259.3 million and $285.6 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $76.6 million and $55.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2013 and 2012 is primarily due to an increase of tax credit attributes resulting from the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2013, resolution of certain tax matters, and reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to intangibles and fixed assets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2013 and 2012 valuation allowance of $76.6 million and $55.2 million primarily relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. At our fiscal year end of June 30, 2013 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in California. We also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the 38 Table of Contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance, completed our system installation obligations, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market 39 Table of Contents conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system-by-system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 40 Table of Contents In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available. Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Each component of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. All goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. Beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis, we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Under the revised guidance, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of April 1, 2013, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2012 or 2011. As a result of historical performance and growth potential, our Clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections. 41 Table of Contents The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments in this standard require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this guidance in the September 2012 quarter. The implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations, but did change the presentation of our financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The February 2013 update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, this update requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements or in the notes amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. As allowed in the update, the Company elected to early adopt these disclosure amendments in the quarter ended March 31, 2013. The implementation of this update did not impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it was disclosure-only in nature. In July 2013, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 ""Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists"". 42 Table of Contents The new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. We are required to adopt this standard starting fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013 compared to $3.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012. This decrease was primarily due to share repurchases of $956 million, partially offset by cash generated by operations of $720 million. Approximately $2.0 billion of our total cash and investments as of June 30, 2013 were held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, of which substantially all would be subject to tax at U.S. rates if it were to be repatriated. Refer to Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $720 million during fiscal year 2013 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 113.9 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 304.1 Equity-based compensation 99.3 Restructuring charges, net 1.8 Deferred income taxes (70.2 ) Amortization of convertible note discount 31.6 Impairment of investment 3.7 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts 200.2 Other 35.5 $ 719.9 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in accounts receivable of $162.6 million and inventories of $76.4 million and an increase in deferred profit of $60.2 million, partially offset by the following uses of cash: decreases in accounts payable of $58.1 million and accrued liabilities of $43.8 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2013 was $238.6 million which was primarily due to capital expenditures of $160.8 million and net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $58.4 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2013 was $887.8 million which was primarily due to $955.7 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans of $70.6 million. Liquidity Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based 43 Table of Contents upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2013 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2013, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $246.5 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The $700 million principal balance of the 2041 Notes has been included in the more than 5 years payment period in the table above, which reflects the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 13 of our Consolidate Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion features. Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $164.9 million. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 30, 2013 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. Long-Term Debt On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes,” and collectively with the “2016 Notes”, the “Notes”). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes. In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the “2041 Notes”). The 2041 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 28.4781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $35.11 per share of common stock. During fiscal year 2013, 2012, and 2011 we made $2.2 million, $5.3 million, and $4.5 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 30, 2013, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. 45 Table of Contents We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2013, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $15.0 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid. Warranties We offer standard warranties on our systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 30, 2013, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 46 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 30, 2013 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as ofJune 30, 2013 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 273,239 $ 271,741 $ 270,243 $ 268,746 $ 267,248 $ 265,750 $ 264,252 US Treasury & Agencies 159,745 158,261 156,778 155,293 153,811 152,327 150,843 Government-Sponsored Enterprises 55,937 55,560 55,182 54,805 54,427 54,049 53,671 Foreign Government Bond 25,450 25,291 25,131 24,972 24,813 24,654 24,495 Corporate Notes and Bonds 874,596 869,895 865,194 860,492 855,790 851,089 846,388 Mortgage Backed Securities - Residential 28,544 28,151 27,758 27,365 26,972 26,579 26,186 Mortgage Backed Securities - Commercial 110,105 109,389 108,673 107,958 107,241 106,525 105,809 Total $ 1,527,616 $ 1,518,288 $ 1,508,959 $ 1,499,631 $ 1,490,302 $ 1,480,973 $ 1,471,644 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long-Term Debt As of June 30, 2013, we had $1.6 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $2.0 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. 47 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 30, 2013 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decreasein Stock Price Fair Value as ofJune 30, 2013 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increasein Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Mutual Funds $ 13,662 $ 15,484 $ 16,394 $ 18,216 $ 20,038 $ 20,948 $ 22,770 Publicly traded equity securities $ 5,322 $ 6,032 $ 6,386 $ 7,096 $ 7,806 $ 8,160 $ 8,870 Total $ 18,984 $ 21,515 $ 22,781 $ 25,312 $ 27,843 $ 29,109 $ 31,640 Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) Risk We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated expenses. Currently, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on Japanese yen-denominated revenues and euro-denominated expenses. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen-and euro-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 30, 2013 are shown in the 48 Table of Contents table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2014 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2014 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2014 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary Lam Research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including cell phones, computers, storage devices and networking equipment. Our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster and more power-efficient devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. The process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and Lam’s product offerings in deposition, etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand. More recently with consolidation in the customer base, the cyclical behavior appears to have diminished somewhat. With a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for Lam’s equipment and services over certain periods. The variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. Demand for our products increased steadily throughout fiscal year 2014 as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. Technology inflections have been in industry inflection points that include FinFET transistors, 3-D NAND and multiple patterning. These technology inflections have led to an increase in the deposition, etch and clean market size. This increase, as well as market share gains in these inflections, have contributed to the increased revenue in fiscal 2014. We believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rise in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share. 32 Table of Contents The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30.2013 June 24,2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 4,607,309 $ 3,598,916 $ 2,665,192 $ 1,008,393 28.0 % $ 933,724 35.0 % Gross margin $ 2,007,481 $ 1,403,059 $ 1,084,069 $ 604,422 43.1 % $ 318,990 29.4 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 43.6 % 39.0 % 40.7 % 4.6 % -1.7 % Total operating expenses $ 1,329,812 $ 1,284,988 $ 846,336 $ 44,824 3.5 % $ 438,652 51.8 % Net income $ 632,289 $ 113,879 $ 168,723 $ 518,410 455.2 % $ (54,844 ) -32.5 % Diluted net income per share $ 3.62 $ 0.66 $ 1.35 $ 2.96 448.5 % $ (0.69 ) -51.1 % On June 4, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc (“Novellus”). Results for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 include Novellus operations. Results for fiscal year 2012 include Novellus operations from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies. Fiscal year 2014 revenues increased 28% compared to fiscal year 2013, reflecting the increase in technology inflections’ spending, as well as, incremental market share gains. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a decrease in Novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments, improved business volumes and product mix. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily related to continued investments in the next-generation research and development and customer facing activities. Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.2 billion as of June 29, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2013. This increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flows from operating activities, offset by $245 million in share repurchases. This compares to $720 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2013. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 Shipments (in millions) $ 4,551 $ 3,714 $ 2,672 Korea 24 % 16 % 36 % Taiwan 21 % 29 % 18 % Japan 13 % 11 % 10 % China 15 % 9 % 6 % United States 15 % 20 % 17 % Europe 7 % 8 % 8 % Southeast Asia 5 % 7 % 5 % Shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately $4.6 billion and increased by 23% compared to fiscal year 2013. Shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately $3.7 billion and increased by 39% compared to fiscal year 2012. The increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand through fiscal year 2014. The increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to having a full year of combined operations with Novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013. 33 Table of Contents The percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the market segments we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012. Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 Memory 60 % 36 % 45 % Foundry 30 % 49 % 46 % Logic/integrated device manufacturing 10 % 15 % 9 % During fiscal year 2014, memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing, stable pricing for memory, and tight industry supply. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 29, 2014 were approximately $866 million and increased from approximately $764 million as of June 30, 2013. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 Revenue (in millions) $ 4,607 $ 3,599 $ 2,665 Korea 24 % 17 % 33 % Taiwan 23 % 29 % 18 % Japan 14 % 10 % 12 % China 14 % 9 % 5 % United States 13 % 20 % 17 % Europe 7 % 8 % 9 % Southeast Asia 5 % 7 % 6 % The revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand. The revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of Novellus. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance was $361.6 million as of June 29, 2014 compared to $389.2 million as of June 30, 2013. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $34 million as of June 29, 2014 compared to $70 million as of June 30, 2013. Gross Margin Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 2,007,481 $ 1,403,059 $ 1,084,069 $ 604,422 43.1 % $ 318,990 29.4 % Percent of total revenue 43.6 % 39.0 % 40.7 % 4.6 % -1.7 % 34 Table of Contents The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix. Additionally, the Novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by $78 million and $15 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher Novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments of approximately $77 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $78 million, and $16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations. Offsetting these higher Novellus acquisition and product configuration-related expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume. Research and Development Year Ended June 29, June 30, June 24, 2014 2013 2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (“R&D”) $ 716,471 $ 683,688 $ 444,559 $ 32,783 4.8 % $ 239,129 53.8 % Percent of total revenue 15.6 % 19.0 % 16.7 % -3.4 % 2.3 % We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a $41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of $7 million in supplies. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 reflects a full year of combined operations with Novellus. Increased R&D expense included $111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount, $46 million in supplies, $26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development, $15 million in outside services, and an additional $12 million in rent, utilities and repairs. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 613,341 $ 601,300 $ 401,777 $ 12,041 2.0 % $ 199,523 49.7 % Percent of total revenue 13.3 % 16.7 % 15.1 % -3.4 % 1.6 % The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of $11 million in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, $20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services, $7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, $8 million of impairment of a long lived asset, and a $5 million cost related to the renewal of our Fremont and Livermore buildings’ operating leases. This increase was offset by a $34 million reduction in integration costs and a $10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the Novellus integration. The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with Novellus. Increased expense includes $108 million in salary and benefits 35 Table of Contents due to a higher headcount, $73 million of intangible asset amortization, $29 million in integration cost, and $14 million in rent/repair/utilities, all offset by a $47 million decrease in Novellus acquisition-related cost. Gain on Sale of Real Estate During the fiscal year 2014, we sold our interest in nonessential property in Palo Alto, California, resulting in $135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of $83 million from the transaction. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 29,2014 June 30,2013 June 24,2012 (in thousands) Interest income $ 12,540 $ 14,737 $ 12,141 Interest expense (61,692 ) (60,408 ) (38,962 ) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan related assets, net 9,559 9,764 (914 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 1,529 (6,808 ) (397 ) Other, net 668 (8,698 ) (5,183 ) $ (37,396 ) $ (51,413 ) $ (33,315 ) The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the 2041 convertible notes assumed in June 2012 in connection with the Novellus acquisition. Foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. Other income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment. Other expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the March 2013 quarter. Other expenses during fiscal year 2012 included a $2 million other-than temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the September 2011 quarter. Income Tax Expense (benefit) Year Ended June 29, June 30, June 24, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 91,074 $ (47,221 ) $ 35,695 Effective tax rate 12.6 % -70.8 % 17.5 % The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014, reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of December 31, 2013, and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was 36 Table of Contents primarily due to the level of income, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and tax benefit due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in January 2013. International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. Please refer to Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $343 million and $318 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $294 million and $259 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $74 million and $77 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to accrual for future tax liability due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 and amortization of convertible debt, offset by increase in deferred tax assets related to accounting allowances and reserves. Our fiscal years 2014 and 2013 valuation allowance of $74 million and $77 million primarily relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. At our fiscal year end of June 29, 2014 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in California. We also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on 37 Table of Contents our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. 38 Table of Contents While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”), excluding market-based performance RSUs, based on the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our market-based performance RSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. 39 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets: The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available. Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Each component of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. All goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment analysis we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter, March 31, 2014, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012. As a result of historical performance and growth potential, our single-wafer Clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and 40 Table of Contents assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.” The new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. We are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position. In April 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2014-8 “Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” The new standard re-defines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. In addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. We are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position. In May 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2014-9 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. We are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our financial position. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared to $2.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013. This increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flow from operating activities. Approximately $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion of our total cash and investments as of June 29, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively, were held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which would be subject to tax at U.S. rates if it were to be repatriated. Refer to Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $717 million during fiscal year 2014 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 632 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 292 Equity-based compensation 104 Deferred income taxes 8 Amortization of convertible note discount 33 Impairment 12 Gain on sale of real estate (83 ) Changes in operating asset and liability accounts (293 ) Other 12 $ 717 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $201.5 million, inventories of $190.1 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $9.5 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $18.7 million, deferred profit of $10.9 million and accrued liabilities of $78.6 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $265.2 million, which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $284.0 million, and capital expenditures of $145.5 million, partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of assets of $156.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $162.7 million, which was primarily due to $244.9 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of Common Stock related to employee equity-based plans of $77.7 million. Liquidity Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 29, 2014 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. 42 Table of Contents In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 29, 2014, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $258 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

As such, the net carrying value of the 2041 Notes is included within current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The $700 million principal balance of the 2041 Notes has been included in the more than 5 years payment period in the table above, which reflects the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion feature. Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $191 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned 43 Table of Contents inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 29, 2014 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. Long-Term Debt On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes,” and collectively with the “2016 Notes”, the “Notes”). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our Common Stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 15.9128 shares of our Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $62.84 per share of our Common Stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes. In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the “2041 Notes”). The 2041 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock based on a conversion rate of 28.5572 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $35.02 per share of Common Stock. During fiscal year 2014, 2013, and 2012 we made $1.7 million, $2.2 million, and $5.3 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. Revolving Credit Arrangements On March 12, 2014, we entered into a $300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on March 12, 2019. The facility includes an option for us to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $200 million, for a potential total commitment of $500 million. Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) LIBOR plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal, and any accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.5 to 1.0 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments, of no less than $1.0 billion. As of June 29, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2014, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. 44 Table of Contents Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 29, 2014, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $20.6 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 29, 2014, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29, 2014 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as ofJune 29, 2014 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 336,959 $ 336,951 $ 336,716 $ 335,433 $ 333,555 $ 331,677 $ 329,799 US Treasury & Agencies 214,385 214,373 214,018 212,587 210,783 208,980 207,177 Government-Sponsored Enterprises 27,894 27,894 27,850 27,692 27,503 27,315 27,126 Foreign Government Bond 35,928 35,925 35,764 35,467 35,159 34,852 34,546 Corporate Notes and Bonds 1,019,017 1,018,062 1,014,386 1,008,788 1,003,035 997,284 991,533 Mortgage Backed Securities - Residential 27,603 27,421 27,189 26,944 26,703 26,460 26,216 Mortgage Backed Securities - Commercial 113,661 113,210 112,585 111,933 111,281 110,629 109,977 Total $ 1,775,447 $ 1,773,836 $ 1,768,508 $ 1,758,844 $ 1,748,019 $ 1,737,197 $ 1,726,374 45 Table of Contents We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long-Term Debt As of June 29, 2014, we had $1.6 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $2.6 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our Common Stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29, 2014 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decreasein Stock Price Fair Value as ofJune 29, 2014 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increasein Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Mutual Funds $ 16,319 $ 18,494 $ 19,582 $ 21,758 $ 23,934 $ 25,022 $ 27,198 Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) Risk We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on Japanese yen-denominated revenues and euro-denominated expenses. To protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen-and euro-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and 46 Table of Contents liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 29, 2014 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.

707549,LRCX,LAM RESEARCH CORP,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2015 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2015 Form 10-K). Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2015 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management’s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary Lam Research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including cell phones, computers, tablets, storage devices, and networking equipment. Our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster, and more powerful devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. The process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps, and our product offerings in deposition, etch, and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and/or productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand. This cyclicality has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among our customers. With a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for Lam’s equipment and services. The variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. Demand for our products was strong throughout the fiscal year as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. We expect growth in the overall wafer fabrication equipment market in calendar year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 related to leading edge investments by our customers. Technology inflections in our industry, including FinFET transistors, 3D NAND, multiple patterning, and advanced packaging have led to an increase in the deposition and etch market sizes. We believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share. 31 Table of Contents The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 5,259,312 $ 4,607,309 $ 3,598,916 $ 652,003 14.2% $ 1,008,393 28.0% Gross margin $ 2,284,336 $ 2,007,481 $ 1,403,059 $ 276,855 13.8% $ 604,422 43.1% Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 43.4% 43.6% 39.0% -0.2% 4.6% Total operating expenses $ 1,496,297 $ 1,329,812 $ 1,284,988 $ 166,485 12.5% $ 44,824 3.5% Net income $ 655,577 $ 632,289 $ 113,879 $ 23,288 3.7% $ 518,410 455.2% Diluted net income per share $ 3.70 $ 3.62 $ 0.66 $ 0.08 2.2% $ 2.96 448.5% Fiscal year 2015 revenues increased 14% compared to fiscal year 2014, reflecting the steady increase in technology inflections’ spending, as well as incremental market share gains. The small decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily related to continued investments in the next-generation research and development. In fiscal year 2015, we also recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately $79 million related to our single-wafer clean reporting unit. Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of June 28, 2015 compared to $3.2 billion as of June 29, 2014. This increase was primarily the result of $992 million net proceeds from March 2015 Senior Notes issuance. Cash flows provided from operating activities was $786 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $717 million for fiscal year 2014. Cash flows provided from operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily used for $573 million in treasury stock purchases, $116 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $198 million of capital expenditures, and are partially offset by $66 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Shipments for fiscal year 2015 were approximately $5.5 billion and increased by 20% compared to fiscal year 2014. Shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately $4.6 billion and increased by 23% compared to fiscal year 2013. The increase in shipments during fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, as well as the 32 Table of Contents increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 Shipments (in millions) $ 5,472 $ 4,551 $ 3,714 Korea 26% 24% 16% Taiwan 22% 21% 29% United States 15% 15% 20% Japan 14% 13% 11% China 12% 15% 9% Europe 6% 7% 8% Southeast Asia 5% 5% 7% The percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013. Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 Memory 58 % 60 % 36 % Foundry 30 % 30 % 49 % Logic/integrated device manufacturing 12 % 10 % 15 % Our shipments to memory customers remained strong during fiscal year 2015 driven by mobile and enterprise demands. During fiscal year 2014, memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing, stable pricing for memory, and tight industry supply. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 28, 2015 were approximately $880 million and increased from approximately $866 million as of June 29, 2014. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1, “Business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 Revenue (in millions) $ 5,259 $ 4,607 $ 3,599 Korea 27% 24% 17% Taiwan 21% 23% 29% United States 17% 13% 20% Japan 12% 14% 10% China 12% 14% 9% Europe 6% 7% 8% Southeast Asia 5% 5% 7% 33 Table of Contents The revenue increase in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 reflected an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers. The revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance was $518 million as of June 28, 2015 compared to $362 million as of June 29, 2014. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $164 million as of June 28, 2015 compared to $34 million as of June 29, 2014. Gross Margin Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 2,284,336 $ 2,007,481 $ 1,403,059 $ 276,855 13.8% $ 604,422 43.1% Percent of total revenue 43.4% 43.6% 39.0% -0.2% 4.6% The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix. Additionally, the Novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by $78 million and $15 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013. Research and Development Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (“R&D”) $ 825,242 $ 716,471 $ 683,688 $ 108,771 15.2% $ 32,783 4.8% Percent of total revenue 15.7% 15.6% 19.0% 0.1% -3.4% We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a $71 million increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation, a $12 million increase in supplies, a $5 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance, and a $6 million increase in outside services. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a $41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of $7 million in supplies. 34 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) $ 591,611 $ 613,341 $ 601,300 $ (21,730 ) -3.5% $ 12,041 2.0% Percent of total revenue 11.2% 13.3% 16.7% -2.1% -3.4% The decrease in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to an $11 million decrease in integration costs, a $9 million decrease in costs associated with rationalization of product configurations, and an $8 million decrease related to impairment of long lived assets. This decrease is offset by an $8 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of $11 million in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, $20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services, $7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, $8 million of impairment of long lived assets, and a $5 million cost related to the renewal of our Fremont and Livermore buildings’ operating leases. This increase was offset by a $34 million reduction in integration costs and a $10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the Novellus integration. Goodwill Impairment Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a non-cash impairment charge upon our single-wafer clean reporting unit of $79 million, extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit. Uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance. Gain on Sale of Real Estate During fiscal year 2014, we sold our interest in nonessential property in Palo Alto, California, resulting in $135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of $83 million from the transaction. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 (in thousands) Interest income $ 19,268 $ 12,540 $ 14,737 Interest expense (73,682 ) (61,692 ) (60,408 ) Gains on deferred compensation plan related assets, net 9,071 9,559 9,764 Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 2,331 1,529 (6,808 ) Other, net (4,177 ) 668 (8,698 ) $ (47,189 ) $ (37,396 ) $ (51,413 ) The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 as compared with fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the $1 billion Senior Note issuance in the March 2015 quarter. Foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. 35 Table of Contents Other, net expense realized during fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a settlement of matters relating to certain investment transactions. Other, net income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment. Other, net expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the March 2013 quarter. Income Tax Expense (benefit) Year Ended June 28,2015 June 29,2014 June 30,2013 (in thousands, exceptpercentages) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 85,273 $ 91,074 $ (47,221 ) Effective tax rate 11.5% 12.6% -70.8% The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 due to a retroactive reinstatement of the second half of fiscal year 2014 federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014, reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of December 31, 2013, and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters. International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $311 million and $343 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $318 million and $294 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $86 million and $74 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2013-11, an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2015, and convertible debt accretion, offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to amortization of intangible assets. Our fiscal years 2015 and 2014 valuation allowance of $86 million and $74 million primarily relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. As of our fiscal year end of June 28, 2015, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in California. We also continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses. We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. 36 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex, and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers at the physical transfer of the products to the freight carriers. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers occurs at the time of customer acceptance. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated 37 Table of Contents usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and Employee Stock Plans: We recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation expense. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (“RSUs”), excluding market-based performance RSUs, based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. We estimate the fair value of our market-based performance RSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from equity-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of equity-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement rather than through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets: The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available. Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Each component of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. All goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to our reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, March 30, 2015, resulted in the recognition of a $79.4 million goodwill impairment charge on our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit. We did not record any goodwill impairment in fiscal years 2014 or 2013. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor 39 Table of Contents equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, and to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.” The new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. We adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In April 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2014-8 “Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” The new standard re-defines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. In addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. We adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2014-9 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. We are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard. We have not yet selected a transition method, and are in the process of determining the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2015, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2015-3 “Interest — Imputation of Interest.” The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we do not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $4.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared to $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014. This increase was primarily the result of $992 million net proceeds from the March 2015 debt issuances. Approximately $2.2 billion of 40 Table of Contents our total cash and investments as of both June 28, 2015 and June 29, 2014, was held outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which is held in U.S. dollars and, of which substantially all would be subject to tax at U.S. rates if it were to be repatriated. Refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the United States. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $785.5 million during fiscal year 2015 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 655.6 Non-cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 277.9 Equity-based compensation 135.4 Deferred income taxes 6.0 Amortization of note discounts and issuance costs 37.6 Goodwill impairment 79.4 Long-lived asset impairment 10.0 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts (420.9 ) Other 4.5 $ 785.5 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $294.2 million, inventories of $207.5 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $52.5 million, combined with a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $29.5 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $76.6 million and deferred profit of $86.1 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was $1,106.1 million, which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $949.7 million, and capital expenditures of $198.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of business of $41.2 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2015 was $378.5 million, which was primarily due to $992.2 million in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by $573.2 million in treasury stock repurchases and $116.1 million of dividends paid to stockholders. Liquidity Given the historical cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 28, 2015 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in 41 Table of Contents the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 28, 2015, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date. The amounts in the table below exclude $203 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The principal balances of the Converible Notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 14 of our Consolidate Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Convertible Notes and associated conversion features. Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 28, 2015 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, 42 Table of Contents the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. Long-Term Debt In May 2011, we issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) at par. At the same time, we issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) at par. We pay cash interest at an annual rate of 0.5% and 1.25%, respectively, on the 2016 Notes and the 2018 Notes, on a semi-annual basis. The 2016 Notes and 2018 Notes may be converted into our Common Stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 16.0806 shares of our Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $62.19 per share of our Common Stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events, including dividends on our Common Stock. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2016 Notes and 2018 the Notes. In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the “2041 Notes,” and collectively with the 2016 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the “Convertible Notes”). We pay cash interest at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock based on a conversion rate of 28.8585 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $34.65 per share of Common Stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain events, including dividends on our Common Stock. During the quarter-ended June 28, 2015, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the Convertible Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2015. On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” together with the 2020 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). We will pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2015. We may redeem the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (“par”), plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before February 15, 2020, for the 2020 Notes and before December 15, 2024, for the 2025 Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after February 15, 2020 for the 2020 Notes and on or after December 24, 2024 for the 2025 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. During fiscal year 2015, 2014, and 2013, we made $1.5 million, $1.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. Revolving Credit Arrangements On March 12, 2014, we entered into a $300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on March 12, 2019. The facility includes an option for us to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $200 million, for a potential total commitment of $500 million. 43 Table of Contents Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) LIBOR plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal, and any accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.5 to 1.0 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments, of no less than $1.0 billion. As of June 28, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 28, 2015, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 28, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $15.5 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 28, 2015, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “Other income (expense)” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in 44 Table of Contents the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long-Term Debt As of June 28, 2015, we had $3.6 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $3.9 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the Convertible Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 28, 2015 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decreasein Stock Price Fair Value as ofJune 28, 2015 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increasein Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Mutual Funds $ 25,097 $ 28,444 $ 30,117 33,463 $ 36,809 $ 38,482 $ 41,829 45 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) Risk We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on Japanese yen-denominated revenues and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses. To protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 28, 2015 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus-or-minus 10 percent and plus-or-minus 15 percent.
