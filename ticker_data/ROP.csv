882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In August 2003, we changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to December 31 effective as of January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December 31, 2002 being the Transition Period. We filed an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 on November 3, 2003 to restate our Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 2001 and 2002 and for the three years ended October 31, 2002 to reflect the discontinued operations of our Petrotech operation and the realignment of our operations into four new segments. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and instrumentation products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, medical, semiconductor, refrigeration, automotive, and general industry. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both financial bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On December 29, 2003, we acquired NTGH, comprising Neptune Technology, a leader in the meter management market, DAP Technologies, a leading fully rugged computer provider, and DB Microware, providing various software products for utility markets. As these businesses were closed for the year-end holiday period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to these operations in our fiscal 2003 results. However, the assets and liabilities of the operations are consolidated in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. In connection with this acquisition we retired our existing debt, completed a public offering of 4,200,000 shares of our common stock, entered into a new $625 million credit agreement, and issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes. An underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed in January 2004. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, our results of operations benefited from five acquisitions made during the last six months of the fiscal year 2002: 1. Zetec, reported in our Energy Systems and Controls segment 2. AI Qualitek, reported in our Instrumentation segment 3. QImaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment 4. Duncan Technologies, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment 5. Definitive Imaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment Our largest customer is OAO Gazprom. Gazprom has been a customer over the past eleven years through a number of its procurement affiliates. In late 2002, Gazprom assigned a new procurement affiliate to negotiate with us, and during the second calendar quarter of 2003 we secured a new supply agreement. Orders received under this agreement have been received on a delayed basis and at lower levels than initially indicated by the procurement affiliate and consequently have resulted in lower activity levels than in comparative prior year periods. New orders received under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $25.2 million or 3.9% of total new orders. Net sales to Gazprom were $22.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $56.5 million during the year ended October 31, 2002. During the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure. This structure has realigned our operations into four market-focused groups to capture value-creating opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost opportunities. Having recruited and reassigned new managers to lead these realigned groups in the first quarter, we commenced cascading leadership through these segments with the hiring of several key managers from established growth companies to provide enhanced functional and business expertise. Following the segment realignment, we started a number of restructuring activities. We have completed the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated Design business units, the integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit and the integration of production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging segment facilities. In addition, we have opened a new production facility in Mexico as a result of which we closed the U.S. production operations of the Dynamco business unit and commenced the movement of manufacturing of certain other Industrial Technology product lines into this facility. We opened a new production facility in China to better serve customers in that growing market. During the third quarter, we completed our relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and administrative support activities into a new facility. Final actions to be completed in the first half of 2004 include the move of the U.S. production operations of the Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and a restructuring of the Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of Gazprom business. All of these actions are planned to lower costs and enhance margins. In February 2003, we launched a new motion imaging product line in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Extensive development of this product line commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and was completed during February 2003. During the development period our customers deferred ordering our existing products in anticipation of significant benefits from our new technology cameras and systems. The weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2003, particularly against the euro, the Danish krone and the British pound, had a mixed impact on our reported results. Without the currency changes, reported net sales and net orders would have been reduced by $26.2 million and $25.6 million respectively as compared to the prior calendar year. However, the potentially favorable effects on profits from these currency translation efforts were substantially offset by the impact of selling products in the U.S. that we produced in countries with now increased euro-denominated costs. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill analysis. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases, credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $4.5 million, or 3% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and has remained constant as a percent of sales as compared to the October 31, 2002 levels and the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2003, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $23.6 million, or 18% of gross first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has remained constant with both the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $5.0 million or 0.6% of annualized fourth quarter fiscal 2003 sales. This calculation is based upon both Roper’s and NTGH’s annualized fourth quarter 2003 sales. The warranty reserve for the NTGH entities is at a similar level to the existing Roper entities. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2003, October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, we recognized revenue of approximately $31.4 million using this method due primarily to two of our businesses carrying out major energy and water/wastewater projects of a turn-key, longer term nature. No material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2003 approximately $12.6 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During fiscal 2003, our effective income tax rate was reduced to 27.5% as compared to 30% for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002. The primary reasons for the decline for the current fiscal year are the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We are not expecting to incur in 2004 the one-time costs that created this abnormally low tax rate. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 - the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. The evaluation of goodwill under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our annual reviews undertaken during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. SFAS 142 does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption. Therefore, earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change, except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results. Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre-adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented. Goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was largest in the Instrumentation segment. We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. At December 31, 2003, Roper’s total assets included $711.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill was allocated $224.0 million to our Instrumentation segment, $282.8 million to our Industrial Technology segment, $81.5 million to our Energy Systems and Controls segment and $122.9 million to our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Total goodwill was allocated to 25 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $202 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2003 2 monthsendedDecember 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2001 Net sales Instrumentation(1) $ 181,329 $ 28,390 $ 175,490 $ 125,354 Industrial Technology 170,324 21,379 164,160 170,822 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 138,968 12,353 126,709 107,043 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 166,735 21,763 151,103 159,736 Total 657,356 83,885 617,462 562,955 Gross profit: Instrumentation 58.3 % 57.7 % 58.6 % 58.4 % Industrial Technology 45.6 43.9 46.2 46.8 Energy Systems and Controls 52.8 38.7 59.8 62.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 53.6 50.6 52.3 52.8 Total 52.7 49.5 54.1 54.1 Operating profit: Instrumentation 17.5 % 15.9 % 18.7 % 20.8 % Industrial Technology 21.2 14.4 22.8 24.0 Energy Systems and Controls 19.0 (21.2 ) 26.1 26.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 16.8 5.6 17.1 19.1 Total 18.6 7.3 20.9 22.4 Goodwill amortization -- -- -- (2.7 ) Corporate administrative expenses (2.2 ) (1.9 ) (2.2 ) (1.7 ) Restructuring charges(3) -- -- -- (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations 16.4 5.4 18.7 17.9 Interest expense (2.5 ) (3.5 ) (3.0 ) (2.8 ) Euro debt currency exchange loss -- -- (0.7 ) -- Loss on extinguishment of debt (3.8 ) -- -- -- Other income -- 0.2 0.5 0.7 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 10.1 2.1 15.6 15.8 Income taxes (2.8 ) (0.6 ) (4.8 ) (5.6 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes -- -- (4.2 ) -- Net earnings 6.9 % 1.0 % 6.5 % 9.9 % (1)Includes results of Struers and Logitech from September 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented.

(3) Restructuring charges were $180,000, $279,000 and $50,000 in Industrial Technology, Instrumentation, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging, respectively. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2003 (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in compliance with SFAS 146, are included as a reduction of operating profits in the respective segments. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002 Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of $617.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of 6.5%. A significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and QImaging. We had a significant decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7% decline from the prior period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes noted previously. This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy markets, water/wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8 million or 3.3% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002) and strong results from our European-based Struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water/wastewater projects. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $12.3 million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was due to the full-year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002, offset by the expected lower sales levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or 10.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to both the full-year impact of QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products. Our overall gross profit percentage was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.1% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to 58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that is being addressed by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8% in fiscal 2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this segment in the current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 53.6% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, primarily from $5.9 million of restructuring expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower-cost locations and reduce fixed costs. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in the current period. The company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the NTGH transaction. Income taxes were 27.5% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2003, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $6.8 million in the two month period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger non-U.S. currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 178,255 $ 168,350 5.9 % Industrial Technology 168,798 161,632 4.4 Energy Systems and Controls 143,933 123,038 17.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 154,538 153,349 0.8 Total $ 645,524 $ 606,369 6.5 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of Zetec orders and strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full year of QImaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products (sales increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high-end digital cameras. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 17,068 $ 17,751 -3.8% Industrial Technology 58,024 24,122 140.5 Energy Systems and Controls 30,989 23,985 29.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 42,482 40,732 4.3 Total $ 148,563 $ 106,590 39.4 % The increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The decline in the Instrumentation segment backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business. Two Months Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our Logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi-conductor market. Elsewhere softness in oil & gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and semi-conductor businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4% higher at 41.8% due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures. Overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior-year period. In our Industrial Technology segment, net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross margins decreased to 43.9% in the period from 45.0% in the prior-year; however, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions. Net sales in our Energy Systems & Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended December 31, 2002 as sales contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at Zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season. This adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 48.0% in the prior-year period to 59.9% in the current year period. As a result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior-year period to 21.2%. Management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future. Our Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging acquisitions. Gross margins decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 45.0% in the period from 35.6% in the prior-year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating profits margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business. Corporate expenses decreased by $1.0 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9% due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs. Interest expense held constant at $2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the two month period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels. Other income was $0.2 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7 million in the equivalent prior-year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains. Income taxes were 30.0% of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the equivalent prior-year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits. At December 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002, translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material. If the impact of selling European sourced product in the U.S. is also considered, the impact of currency movements was negligible. Net orders, booked for continuing operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to the additional net orders booked of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology segment. Overall, our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as compared to December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9 million in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial Technology segment. Net orders booked for the two months ended December 31, Order backlog as of December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 Instrumentation $ 29,433 $ 28,244 $ 18,873 $ 22,286 Industrial Technology 22,811 26,604 25,574 31,183 Energy Systems & Controls 14,254 6,824 25,902 18,426 Scientific & Industrial Imaging 28,780 26,371 46,999 38,874 $ 95,278 $ 88,043 $ 117,348 $ 110,769 Year Ended October 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 were $617.5 million as compared to sales of $563.0 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of 9.7%. $87.8 million of the sales increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal 2002 (Zetec, QImaging, Duncan Technologies, Definitive Imaging and AI Qualitek) and the full-year impact of acquisitions made during fiscal 2001 (Struers, Logitech, Media Cybernetics and Dynamco). Excluding this impact net sales declined by 2.7%, to $529.7 million primarily attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets. The impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15% increase in sales to Gazprom and an 8% increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products. In our Instrumentation segment, fiscal 2002 net sales increased by $50.1 million or 40% over fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a year-on-year sales increase of $64.6 million from acquisitions (AI Qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and the full-year impact of our fiscal 2001 acquisitions Struers and Logitech). Excluding this impact of acquisitions, net sales declined 0.6% (to $110.9 million) as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment declined by $6.7 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil & gas exploration markets. The full-year impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales increased by $19.7 million or 18.4% with $13.1 million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal 2002 acquisition of Zetec. Excluding the impact of Zetec, net sales increased 6.1% (to $113.6 million) due to gains in sales of oil & gas control system applications, including those sold to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 of $8.6 million or 5.4%. The decrease resulted principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new generation of products that began shipping during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 acquisitions (QImaging, Definitive Imaging and Duncan Technologies) and the full-year increase of a fiscal 2001 acquisition (Media Cybernetics) mitigated the decline by $8.8 million. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions net sales declined by 11.1% (to $139.2 million). Our overall gross profit percentage was 54.1% in fiscal 2002 and the same as in fiscal 2001. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal 2002 at 58.6% as compared to 58.4% in fiscal 2001. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 46.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 46.8% in fiscal 2001 as a result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 59.8% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 62.8% in fiscal 2001, attributable to lower gross margins at Zetec as compared to the segment average. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 52.8% in fiscal 2001 as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant reduction in sales. Excluding the effects from the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges expensed in fiscal 2001 of $15.3 million, selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased to 35.2% of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 33.5% of net sales in fiscal 2001. This increase is attributable to higher SG&A expense levels at newly acquired businesses. SG&A expenses for companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2% in 2002 despite significantly increased R&D and other engineering expenses in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, most notably Redlake MASD. There was also an increase in corporate SG&A due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our four business segments by between 1% and 2%. Interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2002 compared to the year ended October 31, 2001. Average borrowing levels were approximately 36% higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective interest rates were approximately 14% lower during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. A euro debt foreign exchange loss of $4.1 million arose from euro-denominated debt that was carried in the U.S. and the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This debt matured near July 31, 2002 and was replaced with U.S. dollar denominated debt. Income taxes were 31% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with European tax structures. During fiscal 2002, we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under SFAS 142 as of November 1, 2001. This review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value. If an impairment was indicated, the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. This impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle, was a non-cash charge and was related to the Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco units. At October 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $13.7 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002. Approximately $11 million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Fiscal 2002’s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non-U.S. currencies. The benefits were less than 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002’s financial information. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 168,350 $ 118,481 42 % Industrial Technology 161,632 171,550 -6 Energy Systems and Controls 123,038 119,137 3 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 153,349 157,096 -2 Total $ 606,369 $ 566,264 7 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due largely to 2001 and 2002 acquisitions and higher orders for oil and gas desulfurization applications, offset somewhat by lower orders for semiconductor capital equipment markets. Industrial Technology segment net orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the Company’s turbomachinery control systems, as well as the 2002 acquisition of Zetec, with the year-to-year comparison adversely affected by a $20 million supplemental order from Gazprom in 2001. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders fell as the benefit from 2002 and 2001 acquisitions was more than offset by weak semiconductor markets and lower motion imaging product activity. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 17,751 $ 25,155 29 % Industrial Technology 24,122 26,608 -9 Energy Systems and Controls 23,985 21,928 9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 40,732 38,100 7 Total $ 106,590 $ 111,791 -5% A significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at October 31, 2002 compared to October 31, 2001 was the $11.5 million residual one-time supplemental Gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for Energy Systems and Controls. Excluding this order, total Company backlog increased 6% from $100.3 million to $106.6 million. Declines in Instrumentation and Industrial Technology were attributable to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets, respectively. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $71.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, $86.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and $102.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2001. Excluding the one time write-off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company of $24.4 million, net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was $95.7 million, an increase of $8.9 million over fiscal 2002. This increase reflected stronger earnings from operations and reduced inventories. Most of the decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the one-time supplemental order for Gazprom, partially offset by improved cash generation from assets. We expect our net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004 to be higher than the levels experienced in the prior three fiscal years due to the NTGH acquisition completed on December 29, 2003. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows. Financing activities in fiscal 2003 also included replacing our existing $275 million credit agreement and $125 million senior notes with our current $625 million credit agreement and $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $170.4 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $126.7 million at October 31, 2002. We acquired approximately $70.2 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2003. Total debt was $651.1 million at December 31, 2003 (49.8% of total capital) compared to $332.1 million at October 31, 2002 (47% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2003 compared to October 31, 2002 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current fiscal year to fund the NTGH acquisition and replace the previous credit agreement and senior notes. Our principal $625 million credit facility with a group of banks and our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes will provide most of our daily external financing requirements. The credit facility consists of a $400 million term loan with a five year maturity and a $225 million revolving loan with a three year maturity. Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034. At December 31, 2003, our debt consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes, a $400 million term loan and $20 million drawn against the revolver. The Company also had $14.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2003. We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions. Additionally, on January 6, 2004 we received approximately $30 million from the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment in connection with our public offering of common shares. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2003. Capital expenditures of $10.4 million, $7.7 million and $7.4 million were incurred during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 to be slightly higher as a percentage of sales due to the current higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired Neptune Technology business. In November 2003, Roper’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to $0.09625 per share from $0.0875 per share, an increase of 10%. This represents the eleventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Roper’s 1992 initial public offering. Our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2004. Payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors. Description of Certain Indebtedness New Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the NTGH acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2003, we entered into a new $625 million senior secured credit facility. The new credit facility consists of a five-year $400 million term loan and a three-year $225 million revolving loan. Our new credit facility requires us to prepay our term loan and, in certain cases, reduce our commitments under our revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows, unless we meet a consolidated senior leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we also issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. Each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 651,109 $ 21,109 $ 20,000 $ 60,000 $ 40,000 $ 280,000 $ 230,000 Operating Leases 62,300 11,800 9,700 7,100 5,300 4,500 23,900 Total $ 713,409 $ 32,909 $ 29,700 $ 67,100 $ 45,300 $ 284,500 $ 253,900 Other Commercial Commitments Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Total Amount Committed 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 14,546 $ 5,316 $ 9,200 $30 - - - At December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2004 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies; and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Company adopted Statement of Accounting Financial Standard, SFAS No. 143 - “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” as of November 1, 2002. There was no material impact to the company related to this new statement. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45 - “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” as of January 1, 2003. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company has no new guarantees after December 31, 2002 requiring the measurement provisions of this Interpretation. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46(“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” An entity is subject to the consolidation rules of FIN 46 and is referred to as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) if the entity’s equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional financial support. FIN 46 applies immediately to all VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and is effective as of December 31, 2003 for any VIEs deemed to be special purpose entities (“SPEs”) created prior to February 1, 2003. The FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (“FIN 46-R”) in December 2003. FIN 46-R is effective for the interim period ending March 31, 2004 for all new or existing VIEs. The Company is not required to adopt FIN 46 since it has no SPEs. The Company will implement the provisions of FIN 46-R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, and is evaluating the effect this Interpretation will have on the Company’s financial statements. The FASB issued SFAS No. 148 - “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends certain disclosure requirements of Statement 123. Currently, Roper has chosen not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123; however, as permitted by SFAS 123, the Company continues to apply intrinsic value accounting for its stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with some exceptions for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” which modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments. SFAS No. 150 requires that these financial instruments be classified as liabilities and applied immediately for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The new SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans, of which certain disclosures are not required until 2004. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements that were effective for 2003. In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”). SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation (“APBO”). FSP 106-1 allows companies that sponsor affected postretirement benefit plans to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the Act on postretirement benefit expense and on the APBO pursuant to SFAS No. 106. The Company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until 2004. In November 2002, the EITF issued a final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Companies may also elect to apply the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted EITF Issue No. 00-21 prospectively for contracts beginning after June 30, 2003. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” which clarifies existing SEC guidance regarding revenues for contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with EITF Issue No. 00-21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, operations, or cash flows. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the NTGH acquisition. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to integrate the NTGH acquisition businesses into our operations; any unforeseen liabilities associated with the NTGH businesses or future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; reductions in our business with Gazprom; the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; increased product liability and insurance costs; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of our markets; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation; potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government’s delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2003 we had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility. Our $400 million 5-year term note under this credit facility was variable at a spread over LIBOR. Any borrowings under the $225 million revolver have a fixed rate, but the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. Subsequent to year end, we fixed the interest rate at 4.108% on $100 million of the term note for a period of two years. At December 31, 2003, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2003, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility were $420 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $3.2 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during fiscal 2003 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between fiscal 2003’s operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2003 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $1.4 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 resulted in an increase in net assets of $43.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $33.6 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:33.722006
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In August 2003, we changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to December 31 effective as of January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December 31, 2002 being the Transition Period. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite-based communication technologies and related services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency (RF) applications, water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, general industry and 15 other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On June 7, 2004, we purchased the power generation business of R/D Tech which was combined with our existing Zetec business in the area of non-destructive evaluation. On December 13, 2004, we acquired TransCore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification (RFID), satellite-based communication, mobile asset tracking, security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services. In connection with this acquisition we replaced our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and restated $1.055 billion credit agreement. An underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our results of operations benefited from the NTGH acquisition made on December 29, 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004. During the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure. This structure includes four market-focused groups intended to capture value-creating opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels, technologies and common cost opportunities. Following the segment realignment, we started a number of restructuring activities that were completed in the first quarter of 2004. During 2003, we completed the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated Design business units, the integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit, the integration of production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging segment facilities and the relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and administrative support into a new facility. In 2003 we also opened new production facilities in Mexico and China. During 2004 we moved the U.S. production operations of the Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and completed a restructuring of the Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of OAO Gazprom business. All of these actions were planned to lower costs and enhance profit margins. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $7.8 million, or 3.1% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the December 31, 2003 level. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2004, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $25.6 million, or 16.1% of gross first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 18.0% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2004, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $6.4 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003, and October 31, 2002. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2004, we recognized revenue of approximately $16.8 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term energy projects. No material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $31.4 million and $2.4 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004 approximately $58.3 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. We expect a significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8%, which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit, as compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was abnormally low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCore’s higher effective rate. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 – the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in somewhat cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our annual reviews undertaken during 2004 and 2003 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2004 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2003 2 monthsendedDecember 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2002 Net sales Instrumentation $ 213,722 $ 181,329 $ 28,390 $ 175,490 Industrial Technology(1) 396,671 170,324 21,379 164,160 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 156,232 138,968 12,353 126,709 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(3) 187,926 166,735 21,763 151,103 RF Technology(4) 15,213 -- -- -- Total 969,764 657,356 83,885 617,462 Gross profit: Instrumentation 57.8 % 58.3 % 57.7 % 58.6 % Industrial Technology 42.6 45.6 43.9 46.2 Energy Systems and Controls 52.3 52.8 38.7 59.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 55.7 53.6 50.6 52.3 RF Technology 40.4 -- -- -- Total 50.0 52.7 49.5 54.1 Operating profit: Instrumentation 20.2 % 17.5 % 15.9 % 18.7 % Industrial Technology 20.7 21.2 14.4 22.8 Energy Systems and Controls 21.6 19.0 (21.2 ) 26.1 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 17.2 16.8 5.6 17.1 RF Technology (0.1 ) -- -- -- Total 19.7 18.6 7.3 20.9 Corporate administrative expenses (2.0 ) (2.2 ) (1.9 ) (2.2 ) Income from continuing operations 17.7 16.4 5.4 18.7 Interest expense (3.0 ) (2.5 ) (3.5 ) (3.0 ) Euro debt currency exchange loss -- -- -- (0.7 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.8 ) (3.8 ) -- -- Other income/(expense) (0.1 ) -- 0.2 0.5 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 13.8 10.1 2.1 15.6 Income taxes (4.1 ) (2.8 ) (0.6 ) (4.8 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes -- (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes -- -- -- (4.2 ) Net earnings 9.7 % 6.9 % 1.0 % 6.5 % (1) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003.

(3) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (4) Includes results of TransCore from December 13, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily resulted from the NTGH acquisition, and also included stronger sales into industrial, energy, and commercial refrigeration end markets. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3 million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to the partial-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications, substantially offset by lower sales to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003. Our RF Technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December 13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to 58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to 52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non-destructive testing business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in 2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high-performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year. This was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Interest expense increased $12.5 million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition in December 2003. Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million credit related to a R&D study completed during the year. We expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCore’s higher effective rate. At December 31, 2004, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non-U.S. currencies. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 215,821 $ 178,255 21.1 % Industrial Technology 386,488 168,798 129.0 Energy Systems and Controls 170,459 143,933 18.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 182,887 154,538 18.3 RF Technology 15,213 -- n.m. Total $ 970,868 $ 645,524 50.4 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the increase was due to the stronger European and Asian currencies against the dollar. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included in the prior year. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the non-destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of R/D Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year. In addition, there was continued strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 20,310 $ 17,068 19.0 % Industrial Technology 50,004 58,024 -13.8 Energy Systems and Controls 45,076 30,989 45.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 36,835 42,482 -13.3 RF Technology 183,742 -- -- Total $ 335,967 $ 148,563 126.1 % The increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the TransCore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002 Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of $617.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of 6.5%. A significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and QImaging. We had a significant decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7% decline from the prior period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes. This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy markets, water/wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8 million or 3.3% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002) and strong results from our European-based Struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water/wastewater projects. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $12.3 million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was due to the full-year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002, offset by the expected lower sales levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or 10.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to both the full-year impact of QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products. Our overall gross profit percentage was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.1% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to 58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that was addressed by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8% in fiscal 2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this segment in the current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 53.6% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, primarily from $5.9 million of restructuring expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower-cost locations and reduce fixed costs. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in the current period. The company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the NTGH transaction. Income taxes were 27.5% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2003, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $6.8 million in the two month period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger non-U.S. currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 178,255 $ 168,350 5.9 % Industrial Technology 168,798 161,632 4.4 Energy Systems and Controls 143,933 123,038 17.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 154,538 153,349 0.8 Total $ 645,524 $ 606,369 6.5 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of Zetec orders and strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full year of QImaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products (sales increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high-end digital cameras. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 17,068 $ 17,751 -3.8% Industrial Technology 58,024 24,122 140.5 Energy Systems and Controls 30,989 23,985 29.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 42,482 40,732 4.3 Total $ 148,563 $ 106,590 39.4 % The increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The decline in the Instrumentation backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business. Two Months Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our Logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi-conductor market. Elsewhere softness in oil & gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and semi-conductor businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4% higher at 41.8% due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures. Overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior-year period. In our Industrial Technology segment, net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross margins decreased to 43.9% in the period from 45.0% in the prior-year; however, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions. Net sales in our Energy Systems & Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended December 31, 2002 as sales contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at Zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season. This adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 48.0% in the prior-year period to 59.9% in the current year period. As a result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior-year period to 21.2%. Management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future. Our Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging acquisitions. Gross margins decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 45.0% in the period from 35.6% in the prior-year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating profits margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business. Corporate expenses decreased by $1.0 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9% due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs. Interest expense held constant at $2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the two month period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels. Other income was $0.2 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7 million in the equivalent prior-year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains. Income taxes were 30.0% of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the equivalent prior-year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits. At December 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002, translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material. If the impact of selling European sourced product in the U.S. is also considered, the impact of currency movements was negligible. Net orders, booked for continuing operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to the additional net orders booked of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology segment. Overall, our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as compared to December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9 million in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial Technology segment. Net orders booked for the two months ended December 31, Order backlog as of December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 Instrumentation $ 29,433 $ 28,244 $ 18,873 $ 22,286 Industrial Technology 22,811 26,604 25,574 31,183 Energy Systems & Controls 14,254 6,824 25,902 18,426 Scientific & Industrial Imaging 28,780 26,371 46,999 38,874 $ 95,278 $ 88,043 $ 117,348 $ 110,769 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $164.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, $71.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, and $86.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. 2003 results include a $24.4 million write-off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company. The increase in 2004 over 2003 reflected stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of NTGH in 2004, strong internal growth, the non-recurrence of debt extinguishment cash cost and low cash tax payments due to the utilization of certain domestic net operating losses for tax purposes. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $209.7 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $170.4 million at December 31, 2003. We acquired approximately $53.2 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2004. Total debt was $891.9 million at December 31, 2004 (44.4% of total capital) compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2003 (49.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current year to fund the TransCore acquisition and replace the previous credit facility. Our $1.055 billion credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. At December 31, 2004, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, and the $655 million term loan. The Company had $47.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004. $45 million of the letters of credit were issued via the revolving loan, thereby reducing its remaining capacity to $355 million. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2004. Capital expenditures of $12.1 million, $10.4 million and $7.7 million were incurred during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be slightly higher due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired TransCore business. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the TransCore acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 891,891 $ 36,527 $ 34,673 $ 65,500 $ 98,250 $ 426,941 $ 230,000 Operating Leases 89,100 25,700 20,900 14,200 8,600 5,800 13,900 Total $ 980,991 $ 62,227 $ 55,573 $ 79,700 $ 106,850 $ 432,741 $ 243,900 Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountCommitted 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 47,295 $ 46,743 $ 149 $ 134 $ 139 $ 50 $ 80 At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2005 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation. The implementation of FSP 106-1 had no material impact on the Company. The Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 03-6, “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share,” effective for periods ending after March 31, 2004, regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. The Company does not have securities subject to the provisions of EITF 03-6 and, as such, the implementation of EITF 03-6 had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements. The EITF reached final consensus on EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” which would require convertible debt with a market price contingency to be included in diluted EPS calculations. The consensus should be applied to reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. During December 2004, management completed a consent solicitation to modify the conversion provisions on the company’s convertible notes with the effect that they will not be required to be included in diluted EPS calculations pursuant to EITF 04-8. In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, “Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste. The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements. In December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004) effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This standard requires unvested equity awards outstanding at the effective date to continue to be measured and charged to expense over the remaining requisite service (vesting) period as required by FAS 123. The Company will implement this standard effective July 1, 2005 and is currently evaluating the impact of this statement. The FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109-1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified production activities income” FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new FSPs. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the TransCore acquisition. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to integrate the TransCore acquisition businesses into our operations; any unforeseen liabilities associated with the TransCore businesses or future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; reductions in our business with Gazprom; the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; risk of rising interest rates; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of our markets; reduction of business with large customers; risks associated with government contracts; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation; potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government’s delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2004, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, the Company entered into fixed rate swap agreements, including a $100 million agreement expiring January 6, 2006, and, subsequent to year end, a $250 million agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2004, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2004, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $555 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.6 million (before accounting for the $250 million fixed rate swap agreement which we entered into subsequent to year end). Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 36% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during 2004 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between 2004 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2004 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2003 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2004 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.9 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2004 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003 resulted in an increase in net assets of $27.3 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $19.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:31.750826
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite-based communication technologies and related services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency (RF) applications, water, energy, research and medical, and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 25, 2005, we purchased Inovonics, a provider of 900 MHz radio frequency products primarily for security, sub-metering and remote temperature monitoring applications. On June 17, 2005 we purchased CIVCO, a provider of diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in conjunction with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures primarily in urology, radiology and cardiology. On November 30, 2005, we purchased MEDTEC, which designs, develops and distributes enabling technologies essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment for cancer care. MEDTEC products include patient positioning devices, image-guided therapy software, and related products and accessories. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our results of operations benefited from the TransCore acquisition made on December 13, 2004, the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004, and the partial year activities of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC. In conjunction with the acquisition of TransCore, a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification (RFID), satellite-based communication, mobile asset tracking, security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services, we replaced our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and restated $1.055 billion credit agreement. An underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our results of operations benefited from the Neptune Technology Group Holdings, Inc. (“NTGH”) acquisition made on December 29, 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.3 million, for a total of $8.6 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the December 31, 2004 level. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2005, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $24.3 million, or 15.4% of gross first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 16.1% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2005, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $6.6 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, and December 31, 2003. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized revenue of approximately $90.0 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $16.8 million and $31.4 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005 approximately $100.0 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. We expected the significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method and we expect this higher level to continue in the future. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the company does not expect a recurrence of 2005‘s reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2005. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 24 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $416 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 months ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net sales Instrumentation $ 232,916 $ 213,722 $ 181,329 Industrial Technology(1) 430,037 396,671 170,324 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 174,674 156,232 138,968 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(3) 219,530 187,926 166,735 RF Technology(4) 396,574 15,213 -- Total 1,453,731 969,764 657,356 Gross profit: Instrumentation 58.5 % 57.8 % 58.3 % Industrial Technology 44.1 42.6 45.6 Energy Systems and Controls 54.7 52.3 52.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 55.3 55.7 53.6 RF Technology 46.4 40.4 -- Total 50.0 50.0 52.7 Operating profit: Instrumentation 22.5 % 20.2 % 17.5 % Industrial Technology 22.5 20.7 21.2 Energy Systems and Controls 25.7 21.6 19.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 18.0 17.2 16.8 RF Technology 14.8 (0.1 ) -- Total 20.1 19.7 18.6 Corporate administrative expenses (1.9 )% (2.0 )% (2.2 )% Income from continuing operations 18.2 17.7 16.4 Interest expense (3.0 ) (3.0 ) (2.5 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) (0.8 ) (3.8 ) Other income/(expense) 0.2 (0.1 ) -- Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 15.1 13.8 10.1 Income taxes (4.6 ) (4.1 ) (2.8 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes -- -- (0.4 ) Net earnings 10.5 % 9.7 % 6.9 % (1) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003. (2) Includes results of the power generation business of R/D Tech from June 7, 2004. (3) Includes results of CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005, the NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (4) Includes results of Inovonics from February 25, 2005 and TransCore from December 13, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.45 billion as compared to sales of $969.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 49.9%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2005 results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and from TransCore, both acquired during 2004, approximately ten months of sales from the Inovonics acquisition, six months from CIVCO, and one month from MEDTEC. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $71 million of the increase. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $19.2 million or 9.0% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions, increased sales of approximately $4 million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers and increased sales of our non-destructive testing technology into new channels representing approximately $2 million. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $33.4 million or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets, representing approximately $10 million, and increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately $5 million. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $18.4 million or 11.8% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to the full-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $9.4 million. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $31.6 million or 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the partial-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005 which accounted for approximately $22 million of the increase over prior year. The remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $381.4 million over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the full-year results of TransCore, purchased December 13, 2004, and the ten month results of Inovonics. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which remained the same as 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Instrumentation segment gross margins increased to 58.5% as compared to 57.8% in the prior year. The margins improved due to sales mix and leverage from increased sales. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 44.1% as compared to 42.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of inventory step-up costs at Neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $1.5 million. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 54.7% in 2005 as compared to 52.3% in 2004. This was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable, including a product rationalization effort in our non-destructive testing business, better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.3% in 2005 as compared to 55.7% in 2004. This decrease is due totally to inventory step-up costs of approximately $2.1 million at CIVCO and MEDTEC incurred in 2005. Without these charges, there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.4% in 2005 as compared to 40.4% for the 18 day period that TransCore was owned in 2004. Prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $14.5 million, or 50.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the TransCore acquisition in December 2004, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquisitions in 2005. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Company’s stock. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a $8.2 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of TransCore. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2005, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2004. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.9 million in the year period ending December 31, 2005. Approximately $21.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2005, operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2005 2004 change Instrumentation $ 236,121 $ 215,821 9.4 % Industrial Technology 440,908 386,488 14.1 Energy Systems and Controls 178,393 170,459 4.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 230,434 182,887 26.0 RF Technology 408,825 15,213 n/m Total $ 1,494,681 $ 970,868 54.0 % Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of CIVCO and MEDTEC and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers, which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2005 2004 change Instrumentation $ 21,881 $ 20,310 7.7 % Industrial Technology 58,488 50,004 17.0 Energy Systems and Controls 45,489 45,076 0.9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 54,290 36,835 47.4 RF Technology 200,233 183,742 9.0 Total $ 380,381 $ 335,967 13.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $252 million of our 2004 net sales increase over 2003 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $60 million of the increase. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily resulted from the NTGH acquisition, accounting for approximately $206 million of the increase, and also included stronger sales into industrial, energy, and commercial refrigeration end markets. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3 million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to the partial-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $10 million as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications, substantially offset by lower sales to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $20 million of the increase was attributable to the full-year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003. Our RF Technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December 13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to 58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to 52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non-destructive testing business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in 2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high-performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year. This was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Interest expense increased $12.5 million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition in December 2003. Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million credit related to a R&D study completed during the year. At December 31, 2004, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non-U.S. currencies. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 215,821 $ 178,255 21.1 % Industrial Technology 386,488 168,798 129.0 Energy Systems and Controls 170,459 143,933 18.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 182,887 154,538 18.3 RF Technology 15,213 -- n.m. Total $ 970,868 $ 645,524 50.4 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the increase was due to the stronger European and Asian currencies against the dollar. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included in the prior year. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the non-destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of R/D Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year. In addition, there was continued strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 20,310 $ 17,068 19.0 % Industrial Technology 50,004 58,024 -13.8 Energy Systems and Controls 45,076 30,989 45.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 36,835 42,482 -13.3 RF Technology 183,742 -- -- Total $ 335,967 $ 148,563 126.1 % The increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the TransCore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $164.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2003 results include a $24.4 million write-off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company. The 2005 increase reflects stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of TransCore, Inovonics, CIVCO, & MEDTEC in 2005, strong growth from our other operations, and lower cash tax payments due primarily to the utilization of certain U.S. net operating losses for tax purposes. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and common stock issuances in 2004 and 2003. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $212.8 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $209.7 million at December 31, 2004. We acquired approximately $21.7 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2005. Total debt was $894.3 million at December 31, 2005 (41.7% of total capital) compared to $891.9 million at December 31, 2004 (44.4% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was due to borrowings related to our 2005 acquisitions. Our $1.055 billion credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. At December 31, 2005, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, a balance of $616.8 million on the term loan and a balance of $40.1 million on the revolving loan. The Company had $44.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2005, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2005. Capital expenditures of $24.8 million, $12.1 million and $10.4 million were incurred during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of TransCore acquired in December, 2004. We expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2005. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the TransCore acquisition and the common stock offering in December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long-term debt* $ 890,774 $ 271,376 $ 65,502 $ 98,250 $ 455,646 $ -- $ -- Capital leases 3,497 1,937 1,120 368 59 13 -- Operating leases 82,524 20,167 15,788 11,358 8,653 6,140 20,418 Total $ 976,795 $ 293,480 $ 82,410 $ 109,976 $ 464,358 $ 6,153 $ 20,418 *Includes in 2006 $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however, the Company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months. Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountCommitted 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 44,489 $ 40,093 $ 3,347 $ 209 $ 287 $ 553 $ -- At December 31, 2005 the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $118.9 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2006 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, “Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste. The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements. In December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”) which was originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The effective date of this standard has been delayed until annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2005, which was the company’s calendar year 2006 beginning on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R applies to any unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified after the effective date. The remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value of the unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value that the company estimated for purposes of preparing its SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures. The company adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and applied the modified prospective transition method. This method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or modified after the effective date, but does not require restatement of prior periods. In accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, the company anticipates applying the short-cut method for determining its Additional Paid-in Capital Pool, however the company continues to evaluate such implementation. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006, the company estimates it will record expense of approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2006 relating to its stock-based awards. The FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109-1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified production activities income”. FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The Company repatriated approximately $82 million of foreign sourced earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million and is reflected in the Company’s effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” (“FIN 47”) to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 (“SFAS 154”), “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” SFAS 154 requires that, when a company changes its accounting policies, it must apply the change retrospectively to all prior periods presented, unless impracticable, instead of a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change. SFAS 154 may also apply when the FASB issues new rules requiring changes in accounting. However, if the new rule allows cumulative effect treatment, it would take precedence over SFAS 154. This statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections beginning in the company’s calendar year 2006 which began on January 1, 2006. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 143-1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations (“FSP 143-1”), which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the “Directive”), adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the customer replaces the equipment. FSP 143-1 is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the Directive’s adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which the manufacturers have significant operations. The Company adopted FSP 143-1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal 2005. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include: difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; risk of rising interest rates; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of some of our markets; reduction of business with large customers; risks associated with government contracts; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation; potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government's delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading ""Risk Factors."" We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2005, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2005, the prevailing market rates were between 0.75% and 1.75% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2005, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $406.9 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $4.1 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against European and Asian currencies during 2005 and weakened against the Canadian dollar. The difference between 2005 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2005 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.5 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2005 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2004 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $27.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $21.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:28.056107
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research/medical and general industry. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On April 5, 2006, we purchased Sinmed, a maker of medical positioning equipment. On April 26, 2006, we purchased Intellitrans, a provider of asset tracking technology. On July 25, 2006, we purchased Lumenera, a developer and manufacturer of high performance digital cameras for industrial, scientific and security markets. On August 8, 2006, we purchased AC Controls, a provider of chromatographic analyzers for the petrochemical industry. On November 30, 2006, we purchased Dynisco, a provider of highly engineered sensors and software used in testing, measurement and control applications. The results of Sinmed and Lumenera are reported in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, Intellitrans in the RF Technology segment, and AC Controls and Dynisco in the Energy Systems and Controls segment. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our results of operations benefited from the full-year results of the 2005 acquisitions of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC in February, June and November, respectively, as well as the partial year activities of Intellitrans, Sinmed, AC Controls, Lumenera and Dynisco. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our results of operations benefited from the TransCore acquisition made on December 13, 2004, the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004, and the partial year activities of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”),” which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.8 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.2 million, for a total of $9.0 million, or 2.7% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2006 is $0.4 million higher than at December 31, 2005 but has decreased as percent of sales by 0.5% as we continue to reduce our credit risk. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2006, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $26.4 million, or 13.5% of gross first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 15.4% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory and improve our inventory purchasing processes. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2006, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $7.6 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized revenue of approximately $94.8 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $90.0 million and $16.8 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006 approximately $139 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%, which was higher than the 2005 rate of 30.6% which included a one-time $6.6 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2007 to increase to approximately 35.0% to 35.5% as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income tax. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2006. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 22 different reporting units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $447 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Prior period presentations have been revised to conform to the new segments. 12 months ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales Industrial Technology $549,993 $496,060 $458,022 Energy Systems and Controls(1) 343,699 311,199 278,775 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(2) 338,906 249,898 217,754 RF Technology(3) 468,136 396,574 15,213 Total $1,700,734 $1,453,731 $969,764 Gross profit: Industrial Technology 47.9 % 47.4 % 46.3 % Energy Systems and Controls 54.2 54.2 52.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 56.8 55.6 55.7 RF Technology 46.8 46.4 40.4 Total 50.6 50.0 50.0 Operating profit: Industrial Technology 23.4 21.2 19.1 Energy Systems and Controls 26.3 25.9 22.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 21.4 19.2 18.6 RF Technology 17.3 14.8 (0.1 ) Total 21.9 20.1 19.7 Corporate administrative expenses (2.0 )% (1.9 )% (2.0 )% Income from continuing operations 19.9 18.2 17.7 Interest expense (2.6 ) (3.0 ) (3.0 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt -- (0.3 ) (0.8 ) Other income/(expense) -- 0.2 (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 17.3 15.1 13.8 Income taxes (5.9 ) (4.6 ) (4.1 ) Net earnings 11.4 % 10.5 % 9.7 % (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of AC Controls from August 8, 2006, Dynisco from November 30, 2006 and the power generation business of R/D Tech from June 7, 2004. (2) Includes results from the acquisitions of Sinmed from April 5, 2006, Lumenera from July 25, 2006, CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of Intellitrans from April 26, 2006, Inovonics from February 25, 2005 and TransCore from December 13, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.70 billion as compared to sales of $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 17.0%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2006 results included a full year of sales from Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired during 2005, approximately eight months of sales from Sinmed, seven months from Intellitrans, five months from Lumenera and AC Controls, and one month from Dynisco. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $146 million of the increase. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $53.9 million or 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 68% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $32.5 million or 10.4% over the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $19 million, or 6%, of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 4.4%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, offset by weak sales at Zetec in the first half of 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $89.0 million or 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005, and partial year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera in 2006, which accounted for approximately $65 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 9.7%, approximately 50% of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers. Sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $71.6 million or 18.0% over the year ended December 31, 2005. The full-year results of Inovonics, purchased in February 2005, and eight months from the Intellitrans acquisition on April 26, 2006, accounted for approximately $17 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 13.8% due to strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.9% as compared to 47.4% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were unchanged at 54.2% in both 2006 and 2005, however, there was a $1.1 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charge incurred in 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 56.8% in 2006 as compared to 55.6% in 2005. There were purchase accounting inventory step-up charges of $1.3 million in 2006 and $2.1 million in 2005. Excluding these charges, our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.8% in 2006 as compared to 46.4% in 2005. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Dynisco acquisition on November 30, 2006. The average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 created a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Company’s stock. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006. During 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%. In 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6% which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2007 to increase to approximately 35.0% to 35.5% as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income tax . At December 31, 2006, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $23.6 million in the year period ending December 31, 2006. Approximately $20.7 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2006, operating profit increased by 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 589,322 $ 500,479 17.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 346,880 322,038 7.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 341,178 263,339 29.6 RF Technology 511,188 408,825 25.0 Total $ 1,788,568 $ 1,494,681 19.7 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 12.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of Sinmed and Lumenera and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 95,539 $ 54,959 73.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 79,217 63,583 24.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 68,600 61,606 11.4 RF Technology 261,243 200,233 30.5 Total $ 504,599 $ 380,381 32.7 % Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.45 billion as compared to sales of $969.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 49.9%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2005 results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and from TransCore, both acquired during 2004, approximately ten months of sales from the Inovonics acquisition, six months from CIVCO, and one month from MEDTEC. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $71 million of the increase. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $38.0 million or 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets, representing approximately $10 million, increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately $5 million and increased sales of approximately $4 million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $32.4 million or 11.6% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased internal growth in all business units in this segment, along with the full-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $9.4 million. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $32.1 million or 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the partial-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005 which accounted for approximately $22 million of the increase over prior year. The remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $381.4 million over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the full-year results of TransCore, purchased December 13, 2004, and the ten month results of Inovonics. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which remained the same as 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.4% as compared to 46.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of inventory step-up costs at Neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $1.5 million. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 54.2% in 2005 as compared to 52.2% in 2004. This was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable, including a product rationalization effort in our non-destructive testing business, better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.6% in 2005 as compared to 55.7% in 2004. This decrease is due totally to inventory step-up costs of approximately $2.1 million at CIVCO and MEDTEC incurred in 2005. Without these charges, there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.4% in 2005 as compared to 40.4% for the 18 day period that TransCore was owned in 2004. Prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $14.5 million, or 50.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the TransCore acquisition in December 2004, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquisitions in 2005. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Company’s stock. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a $8.2 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of TransCore. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase as the Company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2005, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2004. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.9 million in the year period ending December 31, 2005. Approximately $21.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2005, operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2005 2004 change Industrial Technology 500,479 448,110 11.7 % Energy Systems and Controls 322,038 297,597 8.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 263,339 209,948 25.4 RF Technology 408,825 15,213 n/m Total $ 1,494,681 $ 970,868 54.0 % Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of CIVCO and MEDTEC and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers, which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2005 2004 change Industrial Technology $ 54,959 $ 49,894 10.2 % Energy Systems and Controls 63,583 60,357 5.3 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 61,606 41,974 46.8 RF Technology 200,233 183,742 9.0 Total $ 380,381 $ 335,967 13.2 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $164.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2006 decrease was expected due to higher tax payments in 2006 as net operating losses from previous acquisitions were depleted, and we were required to reclassify cash flows from the tax windfall benefits related to stock awards from operating cash flows to financing cash flows. These benefits were $10.8 million and $4.2 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used by investing activities during 2006, 2005, and 2004 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and a common stock issuance in 2004. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $270.3 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $212.8 million at December 31, 2005. We acquired approximately $21.1 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2006. Total debt was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2006 (40.8% of total capital) compared to $894.3 million at December 31, 2005 (41.7% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was due to borrowings related to our acquisition of Dynisco on November 30, 2006. Our $1.055 billion credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending March 2008 which fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our term notes. The interest rate on the variable portion of our term loan at December 31, 2006 was 6.11%. At December 31, 2006, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, a balance of $588.8 million on the term loan and a balance of $202.0 million on the revolving loan. In addition, we had $6.0 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had $54.2 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2006, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2006. Capital expenditures of $32.2 million, $24.8 million and $12.1 million were incurred during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 was due to the consolidation of several of our businesses in the Energy Systems and Controls segment, including new facilities in Houston, Texas and Snoqualmie, Washington. We also had increased expenditures related to cost saving initiatives at our Neptune facility. We expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2006. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the TransCore acquisition and the common stock offering in December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long-term debt* $ 1,023,485 $ 298,220 $ 98,250 $ 627,015 $ -- $ -- $ -- Capital leases 3,307 1,691 944 483 161 28 -- Operating leases 104,745 25,503 20,439 16,436 12,299 7,602 22,466 Total $ 1,131,537 $ 325,414 $ 119,633 $ 643,934 $ 12,460 $ 7,630 $ 22,466 *Includes in 2007 $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability, however, the Company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months. Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountCommitted 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 54,103 $ 24,499 $ 791 $ 28,198 $ 276 $ 338 $ -- At December 31, 2006 the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $137.5 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2007 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the requirements of FIN 48, the Company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and make a determination as to whether its position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not criterion, then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007. While our analysis of the impact of this Interpretation is not yet complete, we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” This statement requires a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Our adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.” This standard addresses quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) AUG AIR-1 “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities” (FSP AUG AIR-1). FSP AUG AIR-1 amends the guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance activities; specifically it precludes the use of the previously acceptable “accrue in advance” method. FSP AUG AIR-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the provisions of FSP AUG AIR-1 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and do not expect FSP AUG AIR-1 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include: difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; risk of rising interest rates; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of some of our markets; reduction of business with large customers; risks associated with government contracts; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation; potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government's delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading ""Risk Factors."" We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2006, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring March 13, 2008. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the variable portion of the term loans was 6.11% and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding revolver balance was 6.33% at December 31, 2006. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2006, the prevailing market rates were between 1.6% and 2.4% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2006, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $540.8 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.4 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 29% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during 2006, with the exception of the Japanese yen, which weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar. However, the average rates for 2006 and 2005 are very similar, therefore, the difference between 2006 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2006 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 was only 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2006 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $4.2 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2006 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005 resulted in an increase in net assets of $23.6 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $20.7 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:32.490890
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research and medical, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 21, 2007, we purchased JLT, a provider of rugged computers and software for mobile computing. On February 28, 2007, we purchased DJ Instruments, a manufacturer and provider of pressure measurement sensors. On March 22, 2007, we purchased Roda Deaco, a developer and manufacturer of air intake cut-off devices. On June 21, 2007, we purchased Dynamic Instruments, a provider of audio recording, vibration monitoring and process control equipment for commercial and military markets. On September 24, 2007, we purchased Black Diamond, a provider of rugged mobile computers. The results of DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco and Dynamic Instruments are reported in the Energy Systems and Controls segment, JLT in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, and Black Diamond in the RF Technology segment. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our results of operations benefited from the full-year results of the 2006 acquisitions of Intellitrans and Sinmed in April, AC Controls in July, Lumenera in August and Dynisco in November, as well as the partial year activities of JLT, DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, Dynamic Instruments and Black Diamond. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our results of operations benefited from the full-year results of the 2005 acquisitions of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC in February, June and November, respectively, as well as the partial year activities of Intellitrans, Sinmed, AC Controls, Lumenera and Dynisco. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”),” which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). On January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This Interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.6 million, for a total of $11.9 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2007 is $2.9 million higher than at December 31, 2006 and has increased slightly as a percent of sales by .04%. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2007, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $28.4 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost. This percentage has increased from 13.5% at December 31, 2006. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2007, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $8.5 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized revenue of approximately $135.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $94.8 million and $90.0 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, approximately $133.6 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8%, which was higher than the 2006 rate of 34.0%. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 22 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $451 million. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2007. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Results from 2005 have been revised to conform to the current segment presentation.

(2) Includes results from the acquisitions of JLT from February 21, 2007, Sinmed from April 5, 2006, Lumenera from July 25, 2006, CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of Black Diamond from September 24, 2007, Intellitrans from April 26, 2006 and Inovonics from February 25, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2.10 billion as compared to sales of $1.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 23.6%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2007 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of Sinmed, Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls, and Dynisco. These results also included ten months of sales from JLT and DJ Instruments, nine months from Roda Deaco, six months from Dynamic Instruments and three months from Black Diamond, all purchased in 2007. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $158 million of our 2007 net sales increase over 2006 and growth of our other business accounted for $243 million of the increase, or internal growth of 14.5% including a 2% foreign currency exchange impact. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $94.4 million or 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 63% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $172.7 million or 50.3% over the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco, as well as partial year results for DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments. Internal growth was approximately $45 million or 14%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses, which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $37.3 million or 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera acquired in 2006, and partial year impact of JLT in 2007, which accounted for approximately $23 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 4.2%, which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers, offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year. The supplier issues have been resolved and we do not expect an adverse impact from these supplier issues going into 2008. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $96.9 million or 20.7% over the year ended December 31, 2006. The full-year results of Intellitrans, purchased in April, 2006, and four months from the acquisition of Black Diamond on September 24, 2007, accounted for approximately $7 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 19.3% due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business, which benefited in the current year from a large Middle East project which will continue into 2008. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 48.2% as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins decreased to 53.6% in 2007 as compared to 54.2% in 2006, due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin Dynisco business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 54.9% in 2007 as compared to 56.8% in 2006, due primarily to the additional costs related to the DAP touch screen quality issue. Our RF Technology segment gross margins remained constant at 46.8% in both 2007 and 2006. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses.Interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 16.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the November 30, 2006 acquisition of Dynisco, and additional borrowings throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8% versus 34.0% in 2006. This increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential. At December 31, 2007, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $52.3 million in the year period ending December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2007, operating profit increased by approximately 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 639,348 $ 589,322 8.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 525,899 346,880 51.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 377,653 341,178 10.7 RF Technology 575,100 511,188 12.5 Total $ 2,118,000 $ 1,788,568 18.4 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 9.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, which accounted for 38.7% of the increase. In addition, there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing, non-destructive testing and valve and control businesses. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 93,076 $ 95,539 (2.6 )% Energy Systems and Controls 93,102 79,217 17.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 74,834 68,600 9.1 RF Technology 271,305 261,243 3.9 Total $ 532,317 $ 504,599 5.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.70 billion as compared to sales of $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 17.0%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2006 results included a full year of sales from Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired during 2005, approximately eight months of sales from Sinmed, seven months from Intellitrans, five months from Lumenera and AC Controls, and one month from Dynisco. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $146 million of the increase. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $53.9 million or 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 68% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $32.5 million or 10.4% over the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $19 million, or 6%, of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 4.4%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, offset by weak sales at Zetec in the first half of 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $89.0 million or 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005, and partial year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera in 2006, which accounted for approximately $65 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 9.7%, approximately 50% of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers. Sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $71.6 million or 18.0% over the year ended December 31, 2005. The full-year results of Inovonics, purchased in February 2005, and eight months from the Intellitrans acquisition on April 26, 2006, accounted for approximately $17 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 13.8% due to strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.9% as compared to 47.4% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were unchanged at 54.2% in both 2006 and 2005, however, there was a $1.1 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charge incurred in 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 56.8% in 2006 as compared to 55.6% in 2005. There were purchase accounting inventory step-up charges of $1.3 million in 2006 and $2.1 million in 2005. Excluding these charges, our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.8% in 2006 as compared to 46.4% in 2005. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Dynisco acquisition on November 30, 2006. The average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 created a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Company’s stock. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006. During 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%. In 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6% which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. As described above, our tax rate in 2007 increased to 34.9% as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income tax. At December 31, 2006, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $23.6 million in the year period ending December 31, 2006. Approximately $20.7 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2006, operating profit increased by 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 589,322 $ 500,479 17.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 346,880 322,038 7.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 341,178 263,339 29.6 RF Technology 511,188 408,825 25.0 Total $ 1,788,568 $ 1,494,681 19.7 % The increase in sales orders was due to internal growth of 12.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which was also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of Sinmed and Lumenera and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 95,539 $ 54,959 73.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 79,217 63,583 24.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 68,600 61,606 11.4 RF Technology 261,243 200,233 30.5 Total $ 504,599 $ 380,381 32.7 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $343.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2007 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Cash used by investing activities during 2007, 2006, and 2005 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2007 included a $300 million increase to our current $1.055 billion credit agreement by exercise of an accordion feature of the agreement, increasing the total to $1.355 billion. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $305.9 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $270.3 million at December 31, 2006. We acquired approximately $7.5 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2007. Total debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (37.2% of total capital) compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2006 (40.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 was due to borrowings related to the exercise of the accordion feature of the credit facility to increase the Company's liquidity. Our $1.355 billion credit facility consists of a $955 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending on March 13, 2008 which fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our term notes. The weighted average interest rate on the variable portion of our term loan at December 31, 2007 was 5.75%. At December 31, 2007, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 and a balance of $823.7 million on the term loan. In addition, we had $4.8 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had $56.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2007, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures of $30.1 million, $32.2 million and $24.8 million were incurred during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be comparable to 2007. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility In December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility which consisted of a five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan. The credit agreement contained a $300 million term loan accordion which was exercised in December 2007, thereby increasing the term loan balance to $955 million and the credit facility to $1.355 billion. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted.Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Year Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long-term debt* $ 1,054,986 $ 329,491 $ 725,495 $ — $ — $ — $ — Capital leases 3,606 1,612 1,197 657 128 12 — Operating leases 108,115 27,426 21,873 16,884 11,989 7,929 22,014 Total $ 1,166,707 $ 358,529 $ 748,565 $ 17,541 $ 12,117 $ 7,941 $ 22,014 *Includes in 2008 $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability, however, the Company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months.

See Note 8 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $201.6 million. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2008 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, ""Fair Value Measurements,"" which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2 “Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157” (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (sometimes called “minority interests”) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. All changes in the parent’s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include: · difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; · any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions; · limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; · unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; · difficulties associated with exports; · risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; · increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; · risk of rising interest rates; · product liability and insurance risks; · increased warranty exposure; · future competition; · the cyclical nature of some of our markets; · reduction of business with large customers; · risks associated with government contracts; · changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; · environmental compliance costs and liabilities; · risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation; · potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets; · our ability to successfully develop new products; · failure to protect our intellectual property; · economic disruptions caused by terrorist attacks, health crises or other unforeseen events; and · the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2007, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.355 billion senior credit facility contains $955 million in variable rate term loans and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring on March 13, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate was 5.75% on the variable portion of the term loans and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2007, the prevailing market rates were between 1.3% and 2.1% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2007, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.355 billion credit facility were $573.7 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.7 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 68% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during 2007, which resulted in a 2% sales increase due to foreign currency exchange. The difference between 2007 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2007 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2006 was approximately 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2007 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $6.1 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2007 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006 resulted in an increase in net assets of $52.3 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $34.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper's common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:30.741950
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research and medical, education, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 20, 2008, we purchased CBORD Holdings Corp. (“CBORD”), a provider of card systems and integrated security solutions to higher education, healthcare and other markets. On March 20, 2008, we acquired Tech-Pro, Inc. (“Tech-Pro”), a manufacturer of physical testing instruments for the rubber and plastic industries. On June 18, 2008, we purchased Chalwyn Limited (“Chalwyn”), an air shut-off valve provider. On July 17, 2008, we purchased the assets, intellectual property and internet domain names of Getloaded.com, LLC (“Getloaded”), adding new subscribers to our existing freight matching services. On August 27, 2008, we purchased Horizon Software Holdings, Inc. (“Horizon”), a provider of comprehensive software solutions and related services for the K-12 education market. On September 10, 2008 we purchased Technolog Holdings Limited (“Technolog”), an end-to-end solutions provider for network monitoring, pressure management, automatic meter reading and smart metering solutions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). On January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). This Interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $11.2 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.5 million, for a total of $12.7 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2008 is $0.8 million higher than at December 31, 2007 and is unchanged as a percent of sales. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2008, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $30.1 million, or 13.9% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $28.4 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2007. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized revenue of approximately $127.9 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $135.5 million and $94.8 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2008, approximately $206.8 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2008, our effective income tax rate was 34.3%, which was lower than the 2007 rate of 34.8%, due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $502 million. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2008. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales.

(2) Includes results from the acquisitions of JLT from February 21, 2007, Sinmed from April 5, 2006, and Lumenera from July 25, 2006. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of CBORD from February 20, 2008, Getloaded from July 17, 2008, Horizon from August 27, 2008, Technolog from September 10, 2008, Black Diamond from September 24, 2007, and Intellitrans from April 26, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2.31 billion as compared to sales of $2.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 9.7%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and internal growth. Our 2008 results included a full year of sales from our 2007 acquisitions of JLT, DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, Dynamic Instruments and Black Diamond. These results also included ten months of sales from CBORD, nine months from Tech-Pro, six months from Chalwyn, five months from Getloaded, four months from Horizon and three months from Technolog. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $133 million of our 2008 net sales increase over 2007 and growth of our other business accounted for $71 million of the increase, or internal growth of 3.4% including a 1% foreign currency exchange impact. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a $0.6 million or 0.2% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to the year over year impact of the removal of the Redlake motion camera product line. Internal growth for 2008 was 0.8% led by increased sales in our medical businesses, partially offset by slowing sales in our industrial camera businesses. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $31.8 million or 6.2% over the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $18 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2007 acquisitions of DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments, as well as partial year results from the 2008 acquisitions of Tech-Pro and Chalwyn. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 2.8%, led by strength in our protective technology and oil and gas pipeline controls businesses. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $43.2 million or 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due to broad-based moderate growth in all businesses in this segment. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $130.0 million or 23.0% over the year ended December 31, 2007. The partial year results from the acquisitions of CBORD, Getloaded, Horizon, and Technolog and full-year results of 2007 acquisitions accounted for approximately $119 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 1.9% due to growth in our intelligent traffic systems business, offset by anticipated declines in our large Middle East project as it transitions from the design and installation phase to operations and maintenance. Our overall gross profit percentage was 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to operating leverage on increased sales. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were relatively unchanged in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our RF Technology segment gross margins increased to 50.8% in 2008 as compared to 46.8% in 2007, due to the favorable mix within existing businesses and higher gross margins at acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased to 30.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the higher SG&A structure in our education market businesses within the RF Technology segment. In addition, corporate expenses increased due to higher equity compensation costs and the additional costs to the Company due to the increase in Roper’s stock price on the grant dates of stock awards. Interest expense increased $1.5 million, or 2.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2008, offset by lower interest rates on our variable debt throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in the fourth quarter of 2008. These foreign exchange gains were offset by a $3.1 million pre-tax debt restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2008, our effective income tax rate was 34.3% versus 34.8% in 2007. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives. At December 31, 2008, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2007. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $86.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2008. Approximately $59.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2008, operating profit increased by less than 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 656,176 $ 639,348 2.6 % Energy Systems and Controls 541,472 525,899 3.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 383,543 377,653 1.6 RF Technology 722,670 575,100 25.7 Total $ 2,303,861 $ 2,118,000 8.8 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 2.3% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased due to strength in our medical business and camera sales into the security and teleconferencing application markets, offset by decreases in industrial cameras sales. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth for projects in the tolling and traffic control businesses. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 59,128 $ 93,076 (36.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 84,997 93,102 (8.7 ) Scientific and Industrial Imaging 80,020 74,834 6.9 RF Technology 365,669 271,305 34.8 Total $ 589,814 $ 532,317 10.8 % Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2.10 billion as compared to sales of $1.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 23.6%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2007 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of Sinmed, Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls, and Dynisco. These results also included ten months of sales from JLT and DJ Instruments, nine months from Roda Deaco, six months from Dynamic Instruments and three months from Black Diamond, all purchased in 2007. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $158 million of our 2007 net sales increase over 2006 and growth of our other business accounted for $243 million of the increase, or internal growth of 14.5% including a 2% foreign currency exchange impact. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $37.3 million or 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera acquired in 2006, and partial year impact of JLT in 2007, which accounted for approximately $23 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 4.2%, which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers, offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year. The supplier issues were resolved in 2007 and did not impact operations in 2008. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $172.7 million or 50.3% over the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco, as well as partial year results for DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments. Internal growth was approximately $45 million or 14%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses, which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $94.4 million or 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 63% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $96.9 million or 20.7% over the year ended December 31, 2006. The full-year results of Intellitrans, purchased in April, 2006, and four months from the acquisition of Black Diamond on September 24, 2007, accounted for approximately $7 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 19.3% due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business, which benefited in 2007 from a large Middle East project that continued into 2008. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 48.2% as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins decreased to 53.6% in 2007 as compared to 54.2% in 2006, due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin Dynisco business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 54.9% in 2007 as compared to 56.8% in 2006, due primarily to the additional costs related to the DAP touch screen quality issue. Our RF Technology segment gross margins remained constant at 46.8% in both 2007 and 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 16.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the November 30, 2006 acquisition of Dynisco, and additional borrowings throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8% versus 34.0% in 2006. This increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential. At December 31, 2007, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $52.3 million in the year period ending December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2007, operating profit increased by approximately 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 639,348 $ 589,322 8.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 525,899 346,880 51.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 377,653 341,178 10.7 RF Technology 575,100 511,188 12.5 Total $ 2,118,000 $ 1,788,568 18.4 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 9.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, which accounted for 38.7% of the increase. In addition, there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing, non-destructive testing and valve and control businesses. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 93,076 $ 95,539 (2.6 )% Energy Systems and Controls 93,102 79,217 17.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 74,834 68,600 9.1 RF Technology 271,305 261,243 3.9 Total $ 532,317 $ 504,599 5.5 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $434.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $343.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2008 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and improved receivables collection. Cash used by investing activities during 2008, 2007, and 2006 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2008 included replacing our previous $1.355 billion secured credit facility with our current $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our $500 million senior notes. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $294.9 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $305.9 million at December 31, 2007. We acquired approximately $7.9 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2008. Total debt was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 (38.7% of total capital) compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (37.2% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 was due to the replacement of our previous $1.355 billion secured credit facility with our current $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our $500 million senior notes. Our $1.1 billion credit facility consists of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2008 was 1.90%. At December 31, 2008, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, $500 million in senior notes due 2013, the $350 million term loan due 2010 and $179 million on the revolving loan. In addition, we had $8.5 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had $51.1 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2008, of which $47.3 million were covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2008. Capital expenditures of $30.0 million, $30.1 million and $32.2 million were incurred during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be less than 2% of annual sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a new $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaces its $1.355 billion amended and restated secured credit facility, dated as of December 13, 2004. The $1.1 billion facility is composed of a $350 million term loan facility maturing July 7, 2010 and a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes - On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the Notes. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations Total Payments Due in Fiscal Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 1,260,668 $ 231,668 $ 350,000 $ — $ — $ 679,000 $ — Senior Note interest 169,306 34,598 33,585 33,585 33,677 33,861 — Capital leases 6,848 2,159 1,847 1,023 523 340 956 Operating leases 99,862 27,635 21,003 13,726 10,374 8,036 19,088 Total $ 1,536,684 $ 296,060 $ 406,435 $ 48,334 $ 44,574 $ 721,237 $ 20,044 Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 51,082 $ 47,670 $ 1,262 $ 319 $ 85 $ 1,746 $ — We have excluded $26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $239 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2009 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2008, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.1 billion senior credit facility contains $350 million in variable rate term loans and a $750 million variable rate revolver. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate was 1.90% on the variable portion of the term loans and revolver. Our $500 million senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%, and our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2008, the prevailing market rates for long term notes were between 1.8% and 4.7% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2008, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $1.1 billion credit facility were $529 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.3 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 24% of our total sales and 71% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during the first three quarters of 2008 and then strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in a 1% sales increase due to foreign currency exchange. The difference between 2008 operating income for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2008 and operating income translated into U.S. dollars during 2007 was less than 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2008 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 3.5%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2008 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2007 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $86.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $59.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:28.960004
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On October 30, 2009, we purchased the assets of United Toll Systems, LLC (“UTS”), which provides software and in-lane hardware systems for toll and traffic markets. On December 3, 2009, we purchased Verathon, Inc., (“Verathon”) a leading global provider of proprietary medical devices and services. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $9.4 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.8 million, for a total of $11.2 million, or 2.8% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2009 is $1.5 million lower than at December 31, 2008 and is unchanged as a percent of sales. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2009, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $29.0 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $30.1 million, or 13.9% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2008. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized revenue of approximately $142.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $127.9 million and $135.5 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009, approximately $148.1 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2009, our effective income tax rate was 29.5%, which was lower than the 2008 rate of 34.3%, due to certain foreign tax planning initiatives, our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately $1.8 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment using a two-step method on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 24 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $535 million. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2009. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales.

(2) Includes results from the acquisitions of Verathon from December 3, 2009 and JLT from February 21, 2007. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of UTS from October 30, 2009, CBORD from February 20, 2008, Getloaded from July 17, 2008, Horizon from August 27, 2008, Technolog from September 10, 2008, and Black Diamond from September 24, 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.05 billion as compared to sales of $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of 11.1%. This decrease was the result of the worldwide economic slump experienced throughout 2009. Our 2009 results included a full year of sales from our 2008 acquisitions of CBORD, Tech-Pro, Chalwyn, Getloaded, Horizon and Technolog. These results also included two months from UTS and one month from Verathon. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $79 million of additional sales in 2009 over 2008 that was offset by a decrease in sales of our other business of $335 million, or 15%, which includes negative organic growth of 14% and a 1% negative foreign exchange impact. In order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost-control actions during the year ended December 31, 2009. The cost of these actions totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense. As of December 31, 2009, $11.1 million in cash payments have been made, with the remaining $1.3 million reported as accrued liabilities, which are expected to be paid in 2010. We do not expect additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010, although contingency plans are in place should the economy worsen. The impact of these costs on our business segment results is included below. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a $20.8 million or 5.5% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. Organic sales decreased 7.3% due to lower shipments to research and imaging markets and the impact from foreign exchange was negative 1.6%. These declines were slightly offset by one month of sales from Verathon. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $107.3 million or 19.6% over the year ended December 31, 2008. We experienced negative internal growth of approximately $108.5 million or 19.9%, which includes a 2.2% negative foreign exchange impact. The decrease in sales was due to broad-based weakness in the markets serviced by the segment which led to reduced demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $151.4 million or 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due to a generally weak economy, fewer projects for automatic meter reading deployment at Neptune and the slowdown or temporary shutdowns of many customer manufacturing facilities which impacted our materials testing business. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $22.8 million or 3.3% over the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal sales decreased 6.2% due to weakness in security markets and lower hardware and tag sales related to transportation projects. Partial year results from the acquisition of UTS and full-year results of 2008 acquisitions added 9.3%. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $4.1 million in restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold represented 0.2% as a percentage of net sales in 2009, as our restructuring and other cost containment actions at the business unit level nearly offset the negative operating leverage on decreased sales. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced lower gross margins due to the decline in sales as a result of weakness in their end markets. Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins increased primarily due to favorable product mix, lower costs and favorable leverage due to a record fourth quarter sales performance. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable product mix due to higher service revenue and lower hardware shipments in transportation end markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $54.4 million to $647.7 million in 2009 as compared to $702.1 million in 2008, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 30.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is primarily due to negative operating leverage on lower sales. Included in the 2009 expense were restructuring costs of $8.3 million. Interest expense decreased $2.3 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes, which ceased on January 15, 2009. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.5 million, primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset by a $3.1 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2009, our effective income tax rate was 29.5% versus 34.3% in 2008. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives, our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately $1.8 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction. At December 31, 2009, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $42.4 million in the year ending December 31, 2009. Approximately $28.2 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2009, operating profit decreased by approximately 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 528,208 $ 656,176 (19.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 427,003 541,472 (21.1 ) Scientific and Industrial Imaging 349,132 383,543 (9.0 ) RF Technology 719,666 722,670 (0.4 ) Total $ 2,024,009 $ 2,303,861 (12.1 )% The decrease in sales orders is due to overwhelming weaknesses in world markets, however, sales order backlog as of December 31, 2009, only decreased by 4.1% as compared to December 31, 2008. This was due primarily to a fourth quarter order increase in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging and RF Technology segments. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 52,079 $ 59,128 (11.9 )% Energy Systems and Controls 70,901 84,997 (16.6 ) Scientific and Industrial Imaging 73,747 80,020 (7.8 ) RF Technology 368,762 365,669 0.8 Total $ 565,489 $ 589,814 (4.1 )% Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2.31 billion as compared to sales of $2.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 9.7%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and organic growth. Our 2008 results included a full year of sales from our 2007 acquisitions of JLT, DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, Dynamic Instruments and Black Diamond. These results also included ten months of sales from CBORD, nine months from Tech-Pro, six months from Chalwyn, five months from Getloaded, four months from Horizon and three months from Technolog. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $133 million of our 2008 net sales increase over 2007 and growth of our other business accounted for $71 million of the increase, or 3.4% which includes a 0.7% foreign exchange impact. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a $0.6 million or 0.2% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to the year over year impact of the removal of the motion camera product line. Organic growth for 2008 was flat, as increased sales in our medical businesses were offset by slowing sales in our industrial camera businesses. Foreign exchange added 0.7% to sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $31.8 million or 6.2% over the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $18 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2007 acquisitions of DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments, as well as partial year results from the 2008 acquisitions of Tech-Pro and Chalwyn. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 2.8%, which includes 0.7% from foreign exchange. Internal growth was led by strength in our protective technology and oil and gas pipeline controls businesses. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $43.2 million or 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due to broad-based growth in all businesses in this segment, as well as 1.4% from foreign currency exchange. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $130.0 million or 23.0% over the year ended December 31, 2007. The partial year results from the acquisitions of CBORD, Getloaded, Horizon, and Technolog and full-year results of 2007 acquisitions accounted for approximately $119 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 1.9% due to growth in our intelligent traffic systems business, offset by anticipated declines in our large Middle East project as it transitions from the design and installation phase to operations and maintenance. Our overall gross profit percentage was 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to operating leverage on increased sales. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were relatively unchanged in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our RF Technology segment gross margins increased to 50.8% in 2008 as compared to 46.8% in 2007, due to the favorable mix within existing businesses and higher gross margins in acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 30.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the higher SG&A structure in our education market businesses within the RF Technology segment. In addition, corporate expenses increased due to higher equity compensation costs and the additional costs to the Company due to the increase in Roper’s stock price on the grant dates of stock awards. Interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2008, offset by lower interest rates on our variable debt throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in the fourth quarter of 2008. These foreign exchange gains were offset by a $3.1 million pre-tax debt restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2008, our effective income tax rate was 34.3% versus 34.8% in 2007. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives. At December 31, 2008, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2007. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $86.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2008. Approximately $59.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2008, operating profit increased by less than 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 656,176 $ 639,348 2.6 % Energy Systems and Controls 541,472 525,899 3.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 383,543 377,653 1.6 RF Technology 722,670 575,100 25.7 Total $ 2,303,861 $ 2,118,000 8.8 % The increase in sales orders is due to organic growth of 1.7%, foreign exchange of 0.7%, and the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased due to strength in our medical business and camera sales into the security and teleconferencing application markets, offset by decreases in industrial cameras sales. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth for projects in the tolling and traffic control businesses. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 59,128 $ 93,076 (36.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 84,997 93,102 (8.7 ) Scientific and Industrial Imaging 80,020 74,834 6.9 RF Technology 365,669 271,305 34.8 Total $ 589,814 $ 532,317 10.8 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 367.5 $ 434.4 $ 343.8 Investing activities (374.2) (739.3) (142.4) Financing activities (13.6) 187.9 29.5 Operating activities - The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to lower earnings over the prior year and decreased liabilities offset partially by improved inventory management and receivables collection. Investing activities - Cash used by investing activities during 2009, 2008, and 2007 were primarily business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash provided by financing activities during each of these years was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions and in 2009 also included $121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. Cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $337.8 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $294.9 million at December 31, 2008. We acquired approximately $45.8 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2009. Total debt was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009 (32.3% of total capital) compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 (38.7% of total capital). Our decreased debt at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 was due to the use of operating cash flows to repay debt related to 2008 acquisitions, as well a decrease in borrowings related to acquisitions in 2009 over the prior year. Our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan; however, the term loan portion was repaid in September 2009 and cannot be reborrowed. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2009 was 1.52%. At December 31, 2009, our debt consisted of $111 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, $500 million of senior notes due 2013, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, and $40 million outstanding under the revolving loan. In addition, we had $6.4 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had $53.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2009, of which $49.2 million were covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2009. Capital expenditures of $25.9 million, $30.0 million and $30.1 million were incurred during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1% and 2% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is composed of a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013 and, as originally issued, a $350 million term loan facility originally maturing July 7, 2010. The $350 million term loan was repaid early in September 2009. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 - On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009 an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a $3.2 million fair value adjustment. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Since January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been accrued for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. We separately account for the liability and equity components of our 3.75% senior subordinated convertible notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. See Note 9 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Contractual Cash Obligations1 Total Payments Due in Fiscal Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 1,147,404 $ 110,579 $ - $ - $ 536,825 $ - $ 500,000 Senior note interest2 312,500 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 156,250 Capital leases 6,354 2,217 1,473 813 463 358 1,030 Operating leases 102,721 27,694 19,667 15,503 11,663 8,763 19,431 Total $ 1,568,979 $ 171,740 $ 52,390 $ 47,566 $ 580,201 $ 40,371 $ 676,711 Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 53,329 $ 44,378 $ 2,275 $ 294 $ - $ 25 $ 6,357 1. We have excluded $26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the Senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness” above. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding surety bonds of $285 million. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2010 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2009, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate was 1.52% on the outstanding revolver balance of $40 million. Our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $111 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At December 31, 2009, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 0.6% and 2.2% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2009, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were $40 million in revolver borrowings and the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.4 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 23% of our total sales and 68% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies throughout 2009, which resulted in a 1% sales decrease due to foreign currency exchange. The difference between 2009 operating income for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates experienced during 2009 and operating income translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates experienced during 2008 was 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2009 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1.7%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2009 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008 resulted in an increase in net assets of $42.4 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $28.2 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:33.590523
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, medical and scientific imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, food and food services, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 22, 2010, we purchased the assets of Heartscape, Inc., including a technology with the capability to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting heart attacks. On July 27, 2010, we purchased iTradeNetwork, Inc., (“iTrade”) a global provider of software-as–a-service (“SaaS”) based trading network and business intelligence solutions primarily to the perishable food market. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.9 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $10.3 million, or 2.6% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2010 was $0.8 million lower than at December 31, 2009. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the write off of uncollectible receivables. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2010, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $32.5 million, or 15.4% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $29.0 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2009. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized revenue of approximately $131.0 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $142.5 million and $127.9 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, approximately $157.7 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1%, which was lower than the 2009 rate of 29.5% due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment using a two-step method on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $536 million. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment on an annual basis using a one-step fair value based approach. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2010. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales.

(2) Includes results from the acquisition of Verathon from December 3, 2009. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of CBORD from February 20, 2008, Getloaded from July 17, 2008, Horizon from August 27, 2008, Technolog from September 10, 2008, UTS from October 30, 2009 and iTrade from July 27, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2.39 billion as compared to sales of $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was the result of internal sales growth of 7.8% as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of UTS and Verathon and five months of sales from iTrade. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $193.9 million or 54.7% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. Acquisitions added $147.9 million in sales, while organic sales increased 12.5% due to broad-based increases in medical, imaging and handheld computer markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.0%, resulting in internal growth of 13.5%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $63.0 million or 14.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales was due to broad-based recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $71.3 million or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets, strong sales growth in our Neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $8.2 million or 1.1% over the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal sales decreased 3.2% due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding. Partial year results from the acquisition of iTrade and full-year results of UTS added 4.3%. In 2009, in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost-control actions. The cost of these actions during the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense. As of December 31, 2010, $12.0 million in cash payments had been made, with the remaining $0.4 million reported as accrued liabilities, which are expected to be paid in 2011. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010. Our overall gross profit percentage was 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $113.1 million to $760.8 million in 2010 as compared to $647.7 million in 2009, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The full year inclusion of Verathon accounted for $72 million of the increase. In addition, our research and development spending increased $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense increased $8.0 million, or 13.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year, which accounted for approximately $5 million of the increase, and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.5 million, primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in 2009. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. At December 31, 2010, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker, and the Canadian dollar stronger, against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $19.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2010. Approximately $15.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2010, operating profit decreased by less than 0.5% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 669,882 $ 528,208 26.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 538,861 427,003 26.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 578,957 349,132 65.8 RF Technology 748,536 719,666 4.0 Total $ 2,536,236 $ 2,024,009 25.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 15.8%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $195 million. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010, as did our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment which also experienced an increase of $159 million due to 2009 acquisitions. In our RF Technology segment, internal orders decreased by 1.1%, which was more than offset by acquisition growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 113,981 $ 52,079 118.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 104,466 70,901 47.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 103,769 73,747 40.7 RF Technology 463,115 368,762 25.6 Total $ 785,358 $ 565,489 38.9 % Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.05 billion as compared to sales of $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of 11.1%. This decrease was the result of the worldwide economic slump experienced throughout 2009. Our 2009 results included a full year of sales from our 2008 acquisitions of CBORD, Tech-Pro, Chalwyn, Getloaded, Horizon and Technolog. These results also included two months from UTS and one month from Verathon. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $79 million of additional sales in 2009 over 2008 that was offset by a decrease in sales of our other business of $335 million, or 15%, which includes negative organic growth of 14% and a 1% negative foreign exchange impact. In order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost-control actions during the year ended December 31, 2009. The cost of these actions totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense. As of December 31, 2010, $12.0 million in cash payments had been made, with the remaining $0.4 million reported as accrued liabilities, which are expected to be paid in 2011. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010. The impact of these costs on our business segment results is included below. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $20.8 million or 5.5% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. Organic sales decreased 7.3% due to lower shipments to research and imaging markets and the impact from foreign exchange was negative 1.6%. These declines were slightly offset by one month of sales from Verathon. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $107.3 million or 19.6% over the year ended December 31, 2008. We experienced negative internal growth of approximately $108.5 million or 19.9%, which includes a 2.2% negative foreign exchange impact. The decrease in sales was due to broad-based weakness in the markets serviced by the segment which led to reduced demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $151.4 million or 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due to a generally weak economy, fewer projects for automatic meter reading deployment at Neptune and the slowdown or temporary shutdowns of many customer manufacturing facilities which impacted our materials testing business. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $22.8 million or 3.3% over the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal sales decreased 6.2% due to weakness in security markets and lower hardware and tag sales related to transportation projects. Partial year results from the acquisition of UTS and full-year results of 2008 acquisitions added 9.3%. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $4.1 million in restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold represented 0.2% as a percentage of net sales in 2009, as our restructuring and other cost containment actions at the business unit level nearly offset the negative operating leverage on decreased sales. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced lower gross margins due to the decline in sales as a result of weakness in their end markets. Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to favorable product mix, lower costs and favorable leverage due to a record fourth quarter sales performance. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable product mix due to higher service revenue and lower hardware shipments in transportation end markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $54.4 million to $647.7 million in 2009 as compared to $702.1 million in 2008, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 30.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is primarily due to negative operating leverage on lower sales. Included in the 2009 expense were restructuring costs of $8.3 million. Interest expense decreased $2.3 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes, which ceased on January 15, 2009. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.5 million, primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset by a $3.1 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2009, our effective income tax rate was 29.5% versus 34.3% in 2008. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives, our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately $1.8 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction. At December 31, 2009, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $42.4 million in the year ending December 31, 2009. Approximately $28.2 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2009, operating profit decreased by approximately 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 528,208 $ 656,176 (19.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 427,003 541,472 (21.1 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 349,132 383,543 (9.0 ) RF Technology 719,666 722,670 (0.4 ) Total $ 2,024,009 $ 2,303,861 (12.1 )% The decrease in orders is due to overwhelming weaknesses in world markets, however, order backlog as of December 31, 2009, only decreased by 4.1% as compared to December 31, 2008. This was due primarily to a fourth quarter order increase in our Medical and Scientific Imaging and RF Technology segments. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 52,079 $ 59,128 (11.9 )% Energy Systems and Controls 70,901 84,997 (16.6 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 73,747 80,020 (7.8 ) RF Technology 368,762 365,669 0.8 Total $ 565,489 $ 589,814 (4.1 )% Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 499.5 $ 367.5 $ 434.4 Investing activities (563.3 ) (374.2 ) (739.3 ) Financing activities 167.6 (13.6 ) 187.9 Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year, increased compensation-related accruals related to higher income levels in 2010 and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions. Investing activities - Cash used by investing activities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were primarily business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash provided by financing activities during each of these years was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations and in 2009 also included $121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. Cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $281.4 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $337.8 million at December 31, 2009. We acquired negative net working capital of $5.9 million through business acquisitions during 2010. Total debt was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 (32.8% of total capital) compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009 (32.3% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was due to borrowings for 2010 acquisitions, partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. Our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan; however, the term loan portion was repaid in September 2009 and cannot be reborrowed. The weighted average interest rate on the revolver borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2010 was 1.56%. At December 31, 2010, our debt consisted of $91 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, $500 million of senior notes due 2013, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, and $230 million outstanding under the revolving loan. In addition, we had $6.0 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had $55.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2010, of which $51.9 million were covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2010. Capital expenditures of $28.6 million, $25.9 million and $30.0 million were incurred during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is composed of a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013 and, as originally issued, a $350 million term loan facility originally maturing July 7, 2010. The $350 million term loan was repaid early in September 2009. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 - On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. During 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges , which effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a $14.1 million fair value adjustment at December 31, 2010 and $(3.2) million at December 31, 2009. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest will not be paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Since January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2010 (in thousands).

We have excluded $29 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the Senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness” above. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding surety bonds of $317 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2011 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2010, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate was 1.56% on the outstanding revolver balance of $230 million. Our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $91 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At December 31, 2010, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 1.5% and 4.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2010, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were $230 million in revolver borrowings and the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $7.3 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 64% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies and weakened against the Canadian dollar throughout 2010, which resulted in an increase in sales of less than 1% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2010 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 3.2%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2010 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $19.8 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $15.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:30.303706
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, medical and scientific imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, software-as-a-service (""SaaS"")-based information networks, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. On June 3, 2011, we purchased the assets of NDI Holding Corp. (“Northern Digital”), a provider of 3-D measurement technology for medical applications in computer-assisted surgery and computer-assisted therapy. On September 26, 2011, we purchased the shares of United Controls Group, Inc. (“UCG”), a manufacturer of control systems in the oil and gas industry. On December 1, 2011, we purchased the shares of Trinity Integrated Systems Ltd. (“Trinity”), a specialist provider of requirements capture, safety lifecycle management and engineering software tools, and safety and control system solutions to the oil and gas, industrial process and control markets. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $8.2 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $10.6 million, or 2.4% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2011 was $0.3 million higher than at December 31, 2010. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the write-off of uncollectible receivables. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2011, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $35.2 million, or 14.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $32.5 million, or 15.4% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2010. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized revenue of approximately $151.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $131.0 million and $142.5 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, $132.1 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2011, our effective income tax rate was 29.4%, which was higher than the 2010 rate of 28.1% due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two-step process. The first step of the process utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed in order to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market methodologies are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows, discount rates, and the earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. Total goodwill includes 26 reporting units with individual amounts ranging from zero to $536 million. We concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of December 31, 2011, and thus no goodwill impairment was identified. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment annually using a one-step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is below its carrying value. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2011. Roper evaluates whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

(3) Includes results from the acquisitions of UTS from October 30, 2009 and iTrade from July 27, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.78 billion as compared to sales of $2.39 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 17.2%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 12.7%, favorable effect from foreign exchange of 1.4% and 3.1% from acquisitions. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $61.9 million or 11.3% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. Acquisitions added $26.1 million in sales, while organic sales increased 5.1% due to increased sales in our electron microscopy and medical businesses. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.4%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $93.9 million or 18.6% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 15.9% while acquisitions added $4 million, or 0.8%. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process end markets and growth in our diesel engine safety systems. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 2.0%. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $129.8 million or 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to broad-based growth in all businesses in the segment, with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses, as well as a positive 1.8% impact from foreign exchange. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $125.4 million or 17.3% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 10.3% due to strength in sales to colleges and universities, growth in our water and gas network monitoring products and growth in our toll and traffic solutions. Foreign exchange added 0.7% to revenue and acquisitions added 6.3%. Our overall gross profit percentage was 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our Industrial Technology segment gross margins decreased slightly due to product mix. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $94.2 million to $855.0 million in 2011 as compared to $760.8 million in 2010, while decreasing as a percentage of net sales to 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in percentage of net sales is due to operating leverage on higher sales volume, offset in part by increased research and development spending of $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and higher interest income throughout 2011. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.1 million, which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2011, our effective income tax rate was 29.4% versus 28.1% in 2010. This increase was due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the functional currencies of our Canadian and most of our European subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $11.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2011. Approximately $5.1 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2011, operating profit increased by 1.4% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 767,020 $ 669,882 14.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 608,538 538,861 12.9 Medical and Scientific Imaging 612,787 578,957 5.8 RF Technology 834,903 748,536 11.5 Total $ 2,823,248 $ 2,536,236 11.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 8.3%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $78 million. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2011. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced moderate internal growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 141,836 $ 113,981 24.4 % Energy Systems and Controls 120,497 104,466 15.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 118,609 103,796 14.3 RF Technology 447,355 463,115 (3.4 ) Total $ 828,297 $ 785,358 5.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2.39 billion as compared to sales of $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was the result of internal sales growth of 7.8% as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of UTS and Verathon and five months of sales from iTrade. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $193.9 million or 54.7% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. Acquisitions added $147.9 million in sales, while organic sales increased 12.5% due to broad-based increases in medical, imaging and handheld computer markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.0%, resulting in internal growth of 13.5%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $63.0 million or 14.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales was due to broad-based recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $71.3 million or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets, strong sales growth in our Neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $8.2 million or 1.1% over the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal sales decreased 3.2% due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding. Partial year results from the acquisition of iTrade and full-year results of UTS added 4.3%. In 2009, in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost-control actions. The cost of these actions during the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as SG&A expense. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 or 2011. Our overall gross profit percentage was 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $113.1 million to $760.8 million in 2010 as compared to $647.7 million in 2009, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The full year inclusion of Verathon accounted for $72 million of the increase. In addition, our research and development spending increased $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense increased $8.0 million, or 13.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year, which accounted for approximately $5 million of the increase, and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.5 million, primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in 2009. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. At December 31, 2010, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker, and the Canadian dollar stronger, against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $19.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2010. Approximately $15.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2010, operating profit decreased by less than 0.5% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 669,882 $ 528,208 26.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 538,861 427,003 26.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 578,957 349,132 65.8 RF Technology 748,536 719,666 4.0 Total $ 2,536,236 $ 2,024,009 25.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 15.8%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $195 million. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010, as did our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment which also experienced an increase of $159 million due to 2009 acquisitions. In our RF Technology segment, internal orders decreased by 1.1%, which was more than offset by acquisition growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 113,981 $ 52,079 118.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 104,466 70,901 47.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 103,796 73,747 40.7 RF Technology 463,115 368,762 25.6 Total $ 785,358 $ 565,489 38.9 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 601.6 $ 499.5 $ 367.5 Investing activities (275.7 ) (563.3 ) (374.2 ) Financing activities (256.7 ) 167.6 (13.6 ) Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions, offset partially by higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable balances at year end. Investing activities - Cash used by investing activities during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was primarily for business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 and 2009 was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations, and in 2009 also included $121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $293.1 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $281.4 million at December 31, 2010. We acquired net working capital of $5.2 million through business acquisitions during 2011. Total debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 (25.4% of total capital) compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 (32.8% of total capital). Our decreased debt at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 was due to debt payments made using cash from operations. Our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan; however, the term loan portion was repaid in September 2009 and cannot be reborrowed. At December 31, 2011, our debt consisted of $67.2 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034, $500 million of senior notes due 2013 and $500 million of senior notes due 2019. In addition, we had $6.1 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $49.6 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2011, of which $43.5 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. The cash and short-term investments at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 totaled $164 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect that cash flows from existing business combined with our available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2011. Capital expenditures of $40.7 million, $28.6 million and $25.9 million were incurred during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 7, 2008, we entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is composed of a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013 and, as originally issued, a $350 million term loan facility originally maturing July 7, 2010. The $350 million term loan was repaid early in September 2009. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 - On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. During 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, which effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of an $11.7 million fair value adjustment at December 31, 2011 and $14.1 million at December 31, 2010. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semi-annually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. As of January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at our option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2011 (in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations1 Total Payments Due in Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 1,079,916 $ 67,975 $ 511,719 $ 67 $ 67 $ 53 $ 500,035 Senior note interest2 239,583 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 83,333 Capital leases 5,100 1,931 1,312 721 489 440 207 Operating leases 126,126 33,262 26,525 22,454 17,314 12,590 13,981 Total $ 1,450,725 $ 134,418 $ 570,806 $ 54,492 $ 49,120 $ 44,333 $ 597,556 Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 49,608 $ 36,765 $ 7,330 $ 542 $ 731 $ 826 $ 3,414 1. We have excluded $19.6 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness” above. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding surety bonds of $313 million. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2012 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2011, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver; however, there were no outstanding revolver borrowings at December 31, 2011. Our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $67 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At December 31, 2011, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 2.5% and 5.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2011, our outstanding variable-rate borrowing was the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.0 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 63% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar was weaker against most currencies throughout most of 2011 as compared to 2010, which resulted in an increase in sales of 1.4% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2011 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.7%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $11.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $5.1 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:33.163860
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, medical and scientific imaging products and software, industrial technology products and RF products, services and application software. We market these products and services to a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, software-as-a-service (""SaaS"")-based information networks, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. On August 22, 2012, we acquired 100% of the shares of Sunquest Information Systems, Inc. (""Sunquest""), a leading provider of diagnostic and laboratory software solutions to healthcare providers, in a $1.416 billion all-cash transaction. We acquired Sunquest in order to complement and expand our medical platform. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2012, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $12.5 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.5 million, for a total of $16.0 million, or 3.0% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2012 was $5.4 million higher than at December 31, 2011. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2012, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $42.0 million, or 18.0% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $35.2 million, or 14.7% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2011. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized revenue of $145.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. We recognized $151.5 million and $131.0 million of revenue using this method during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2012, $190.4 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2012, our effective income tax rate was 29.6%, which was slightly higher than the 2011 rate of 29.4% due primarily to a decrease in research and development (""R&D"") deductions. On January 2, 2013, subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2012, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended certain tax provisions, including the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. As a result, the Company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit, which is estimated to be approximately $3 million. The ATRA also reinstated and extended the exclusion from U.S. federal taxable income of certain interest, dividends, rents and royalty income of foreign affiliates, as well as the tax benefits of the credits associated with that income. This provision is retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012 and, as a result, the Company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which is estimated to be approximately $3 million. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two-step process. The first step of the process utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed in order to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market methodologies are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows, discount rates, and the earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. Total goodwill includes 27 reporting units with individual amounts ranging from zero to $992 million. We concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of December 31, 2012. However, negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life and are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2012; however, the fair value of the trade names of one of our reporting units in the RF Technology segment could have fallen below the carrying value at December 31, 2012, had the assumed sales growth been less than that used in the assessment. The reporting unit is a relatively recent acquisition, therefore we do not believe that impairment is probable; however, it is possible that the trade name could become impaired in the future, at which point we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying level of the trade names at the reporting unit. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

(3) Includes results from the acquisition of iTradeNetwork, Inc. from July 27, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $2.99 billion as compared to sales of $2.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 7%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 4%, contributions from acquisitions of 4% and an unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of 1%. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $93.2 million or 15% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 over the year ended December 31, 2011. Acquisitions added $94.3 million in sales, while organic sales increased 1% due to increased sales in our medical and electron microscopy businesses, offset by declines in sales of scientific imaging products. The impact from foreign exchange was a negative 1%. Gross margins increased to 64.4% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 63.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") as a percentage of net sales decreased to 37.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 39.0% in the year ended December 31, 2011 due to investments in new products in the medical businesses in 2011 that did not recur in 2012. Operating margins were 26.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 24.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $48.3 million or 8% over the year ended December 31, 2011. Organic sales increased 7% while acquisitions added $18.8 million, or 3%. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process and nuclear plant inspection end markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a negative 2%. Gross margins were 56.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 55.5% in the year ended December 31, 2011, due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.4% as compared to 29.1% in the prior year due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. Operating margins were 27.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 26.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $57.9 million or 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012 over the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was due to broad-based growth in nearly all businesses in the segment, with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses, offset in part by a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Gross margins were 51.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2011 due to operating leverage on higher sales volume as well as a $5.5 million one-time reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses. This reduction is due to the cumulative effect of an accounting system error which caused the cost of goods sold to be overstated for several years by quarterly and annually immaterial amounts. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 20.8%, as compared to 21.5% in the prior year, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating profit margins were 30.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $3.0 million over the year ended December 31, 2011. Organic sales were flat as growth in toll and traffic systems was offset by a large installation project in gas network monitoring during 2011 that has since been completed. Gross margins were 52.4% in 2012 as compared to 50.6% in the prior year due to product mix. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2012 was 26.1%, a decrease from 26.8% in the prior year due to lower spending, particularly in selling expense related to toll projects. Operating profit margins were 26.3% in 2012 as compared to 23.8% in 2011. Corporate expenses increased by $20.6 million to $77.5 million, or 2.6% of sales, in 2012 as compared to $56.9 million, or 2.0% of sales, in 2011. The increase was due to $6.5 million of acquisition expense related to the Sunquest acquisition, higher equity compensation (as a result of higher stock prices) and other compensation related costs. Interest expense increased $3.9 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2012. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2.3 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.1 million, which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note. During 2012, our effective income tax rate was 29.6% versus 29.4% in 2011. This increase was due to a decrease in R&D deductions. At December 31, 2012, the functional currencies of our Canadian and most of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $24.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Approximately $12.7 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2012, operating profit decreased by 1.3% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2012 2011 change Industrial Technology $ 783,362 $ 767,020 2.1 % Energy Systems and Controls 634,051 608,538 4.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 703,034 612,787 14.7 RF Technology 871,225 834,903 4.4 Total $ 2,991,672 $ 2,823,248 6.0 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 2%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $124 million. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2012. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced negative internal growth, offset by bookings from recent acquisitions. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2012 2011 change Industrial Technology $ 131,621 $ 141,836 (7.2 )% Energy Systems and Controls 109,885 120,497 (8.8 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 234,526 118,609 97.7 RF Technology 471,185 447,355 5.3 Total $ 947,217 $ 828,297 14.4 % Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.80 billion as compared to sales of $2.39 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 17%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 13%, favorable effect from foreign exchange of 1% and 3% from acquisitions. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $61.9 million or 11.3% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. Acquisitions added $26.1 million in sales, while organic sales increased 5.1% due to increased sales in our electron microscopy and medical businesses. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.4%. Gross margins increased to 63.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011 from 61.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 39.0% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010 due to investments in new products, primarily in the medical businesses. Operating margins were 24.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2010. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $93.9 million or 19% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 16% while acquisitions added $4 million, or 1%. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process end markets and growth in our diesel engine safety systems. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 2%. Gross margins were 55.5% in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 53.7% in the year ended December 31, 2010, due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.1% as compared to 29.8% in the prior year due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. Operating margins were 26.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011as compared to 23.9% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $129.8 million or 21% for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to broad-based growth in all businesses in the segment, with particular strength in our materials testing and fluid handling businesses, as well as a positive 2% impact from foreign exchange. Gross margins decreased slightly to 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 51.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010 due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 21.5%, as compared to 24.3% in the prior year, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating profit margins were 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 26.7% in the year ended December 31, 2010. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $125.4 million or 17% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 10% due to strength in sales to colleges and universities, growth in our water and gas network monitoring products and growth in our toll and traffic solutions. Foreign exchange added 1% to sales and acquisitions added 6%. Gross margins were 50.6% in 2011as compared to 49.4% in the prior year due to product mix. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2011 was 26.8%, a decrease from 28.7% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating profit margins were 23.8% in 2011 as compared to 20.8% in 2010. Corporate expenses increased by $7.5 million to $56.9 million, or 2.0% of sales, in 2011 as compared to $49.4 million, or 2.1% of sales, in 2010. The dollar increase is due to higher equity compensation costs and higher salaries and wages. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and higher interest income throughout 2011. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.1 million, which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2011, our effective income tax rate was 29.4% versus 28.1% in 2010. This increase was due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the functional currencies of our Canadian and most of our European subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $11.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2011. Approximately $5.1 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2011, operating profit increased by 1.4% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 767,020 $ 669,882 14.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 608,538 538,861 12.9 Medical and Scientific Imaging 612,787 578,957 5.8 RF Technology 834,903 748,536 11.5 Total $ 2,823,248 $ 2,536,236 11.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 8%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $78 million. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2011. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced moderate internal growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 141,836 $ 113,981 24.4 % Energy Systems and Controls 120,497 104,466 15.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 118,609 103,796 14.3 RF Technology 447,355 463,115 (3.4 ) Total $ 828,297 $ 785,358 5.5 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 677.9 $ 601.6 $ 499.5 Investing activities (1,505.6 ) (275.7 ) (563.3 ) Financing activities 853.9 (256.7 ) 167.6 Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year, increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions and lower inventory levels at year end, offset partially by higher tax payments in 2012. Investing activities - Cash used by investing activities during 2012, 2011, and 2010 was primarily for business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash used by financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during all periods presented was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $307.8 million at December 31, 2012 compared to $293.1 million at December 31, 2011. We acquired net working capital of negative $1.9 million through business acquisitions during 2012. Total debt was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2012 (35.4% of total capital) compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 (25.4% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 was due to debt borrowings for acquisitions, partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. On July 27, 2012, we entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the ""2012 Facility"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, as more fully described below under the heading ""Description of Certain Indebtedness-Senior Unsecured Credit Facility."" At December 31, 2012, there were $100 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Facility, $500 million of senior notes due 2013, $400 million of senior notes due 2017, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, $500 million of senior notes due 2022 and $11.6 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034. In addition, we had $5.4 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $42.7 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2012, of which $36.8 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. On November 21, 2012, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.850% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2017 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2022. The terms of the notes are described below under the headings ""Description of Certain Indebtedness-Senior Notes due 2017"" and ""Descriptions of Certain Indebtedness-Senior Notes due 2022."" The cash and short-term investments at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 totaled $295 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect that cash flows from existing business combined with our available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2012. Capital expenditures of $38.4 million, $40.7 million and $28.6 million were incurred during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 27, 2012, we entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the ""2012 Facility"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of July 7, 2008 (the ""2008 Facility""). The 2012 Facility is composed of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We recorded a $1.0 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2012 related to the early termination of the 2008 Facility. This charge reflects the unamortized fees associated with the 2008 Facility and was reported as other expense. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. At December 31, 2012, there were $100 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Facility. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2017 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.850% senior unsecured notes due November 2017. Net proceeds of $397.2 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.850% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2022 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes due November 2022. Net proceeds of $496.4 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under the 2008 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 - On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. During 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, which effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable-rate obligation at a weighted-average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a $5.1 million fair value adjustment at December 31, 2012 and $11.7 million at December 31, 2011. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semi-annually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. As of January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at our option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long-term to short-term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2012 (in thousands).

We have excluded $24.9 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable-rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See ""Description of Certain Indebtedness"" above. At December 31, 2012, we had outstanding surety bonds of $402 million. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2013 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2012, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $1.5 billion variable-rate revolver with outstanding borrowings of $100 million at December 31, 2012. Our $400 million senior notes due 2017, $500 million senior notes due 2019 and $500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1.850%, 3.125% and 6.250%, respectively, and our $12 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted-average variable-rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At December 31, 2012, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.3% higher and 4.5% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2012, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were the $100 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $6.0 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales in 2012 and 60% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar was stronger against most currencies throughout most of 2012 as compared to 2011, which resulted in a decrease in sales of 1.0% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2012 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.5%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2012 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011 resulted in a pre-tax increase in net assets of $23.6 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $12.7 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:31.962329
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes medical and scientific imaging products and software, radio frequency (""RF"") products, services and application software, industrial technology products and energy systems and controls products and solutions. We market these products and services to a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, software-as-a-service (""SaaS"")-based information networks, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. On May 1, 2013, we purchased the shares of Managed Health Care Associates, Inc. (""MHA""), a leading provider of services and technologies to support the diverse and complex needs of alternate site health care providers who deliver services outside of an acute care hospital setting. The acquisition of MHA complements and expands our medical software and services platform. On October 4, 2013, we acquired the shares of Advanced Sensors, Ltd. (""Advanced Sensors""), which manufactures oil-in-water analyzers for the oil and gas industries. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2013, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $11.4 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.6 million, for a total of $15.0 million, or 2.8% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2013 was $1.0 million lower than at December 31, 2012. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2013, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $43.5 million, or 17.5% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $42.0 million, or 18.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2012. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized revenue of $205.0 million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application products. We recognized $145.5 million and $151.5 million of revenue using this method during the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2013, $222.1 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2013, our effective income tax rate was 28.6%, which was slightly lower than the 2012 rate of 29.6% due in part to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""ATRA"") on January 2, 2013 which retroactively reinstated and extended certain tax provisions to January 1, 2012. As a result, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 included discrete tax benefits totaling $6 million. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the non-recurrence of the $6 million tax benefit taken in 2013. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two-step process. The first step utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. We have 28 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $988 million. We concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of December 31, 2013. However, the fair value of one of our reporting units in the RF Technology segment was less than 5% above its carrying value at December 31, 2013 using the discounted cash flow methodology. The decrease from the prior year's results was due to lower growth assumptions in the current year's testing. The weighted average cost of capital utilized in 2013 was consistent with the prior year's testing. We believe the market value of this unit to be significantly in excess of its carrying value based upon observed market data. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2013; however, the fair value of the trade names of one of our reporting units in the RF Technology segment could have fallen below the carrying value at December 31, 2013, had the assumed sales growth been less than that used in the assessment. We do not believe that impairment is probable; however, it is possible that the trade name could become impaired in the future, at which point we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying level of the trade name at the reporting unit. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

(2) Includes results from the acquisitions of NDI Holding Corp. from June 3, 2011, Sunquest Information Systems, Inc. from August 22, 2012 and MHA from May 1, 2013. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $3.24 billion as compared to sales of $2.99 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 8%. The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 7% and organic sales growth of 1%. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $198 million or 28% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 over the year ended December 31, 2012. Acquisitions added $208 million in sales, while organic sales decreased 1% due to a $20 million decrease in camera sales which was offset in part by increased sales in our medical businesses of $15 million. Gross margin increased to 69.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 64.4% in the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 39.5% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 37.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 due to higher SG&A expense structures at our medical businesses as well as SG&A expenses at MHA in which the corresponding revenues were not recognizable under GAAP (See Note 2 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Operating margin was 29.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 26.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $56 million or 7% over the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic, university card systems and security solutions businesses. Gross margin was 53.7% in 2013 as compared to 52.4% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2013 were 25.6%, a decrease from 26.1% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating profit margin was 28.0% in 2013 as compared to 26.3% in 2012. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $16 million or 2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 over the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was due primarily to the loss of a customer at our water metering business and lower sales at our materials testing business. Gross margin was 51.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 51.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012 due to negative operating leverage on lower sales volume as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a one-time $5.5 million reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 22.5%, as compared to 20.8% in the prior year, due primarily to a $9.1 million pretax charge for warranty expense at one of our subsidiaries, Hansen Technologies, to provide its customers with replacements for refrigeration valves that included a vendor-supplied component that did not meet Roper quality standards. The resulting operating profit margin was 28.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 30.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $6 million or 1% over the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to acquisitions. Organic sales were impacted by lower sales of non-destructive testing systems for nuclear plants and pressure sensors for industrial applications, offset by increased demand for control systems for oil and gas applications. Gross margin was 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 56.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012, due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.2% as compared to 28.4% in the prior year due to product mix. Operating profit margin was 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 27.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012. Corporate expenses increased by $8.6 million to $86.1 million, or 2.7% of sales, in 2013 as compared to $77.5 million, or 2.6% of sales, in 2012. The increase was due to higher equity compensation (primarily as a result of higher stock prices), offset in part by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses. Interest expense increased $20.5 million, or 30.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2013. Other expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was composed of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2.3 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2013, our effective income tax rate was 28.6% versus 29.6% in 2012. The reduction was due to $6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""ATRA""), as well as a $6 million benefit from the correction of an out of period adjustment of tax balances which were immaterial to any covered period, offset in part by increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the United States. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the non-recurrence of the $6 million tax benefit taken in 2013. At December 31, 2013, the functional currencies of most of our European subsidiaries were stronger and our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2012. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $17.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Approximately $9.5 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2013, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2013 2012 change Industrial Technology $ 772,337 $ 783,362 (1.4 )% Energy Systems and Controls 673,569 634,051 6.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 958,830 703,034 36.4 RF Technology 943,757 871,225 8.3 Total $ 3,348,493 $ 2,991,672 11.9 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 4%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added 8%. Our Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2013. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced internal growth of 3%, as well as orders from recent acquisitions. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2013 2012 change Industrial Technology $ 121,943 $ 131,621 (7.4 )% Energy Systems and Controls 131,799 109,885 19.9 Medical and Scientific Imaging 290,435 234,526 23.8 RF Technology 510,553 471,185 8.4 Total $ 1,054,730 $ 947,217 11.4 % Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $2.99 billion as compared to sales of $2.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 7%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 4%, contributions from acquisitions of 4% and an unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of 1%. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $93 million or 15% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 over the year ended December 31, 2011. Acquisitions added $94 million in sales, while organic sales increased 1% due to increased sales in our medical and electron microscopy businesses, offset by declines in sales of scientific imaging products. The impact from foreign exchange was a negative 1%. Gross margin increased to 64.4% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 63.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") as a percentage of net sales decreased to 37.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 39.0% in the year ended December 31, 2011 due to investments in new products in the medical businesses in 2011 that did not recur in 2012. Operating margin was 26.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 24.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $48 million or 8% over the year ended December 31, 2011. Organic sales increased 7% while acquisitions added $19 million, or 3%. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process and nuclear plant inspection end markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a negative 2%. Gross margin was 56.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 55.5% in the year ended December 31, 2011, due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.4% as compared to 29.1% in the prior year due to operating leverage from higher sales volume. Operating margin was 27.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 26.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $58 million or 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012 over the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was due to broad-based growth in nearly all businesses in the segment, with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses, offset in part by a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Gross margin was 51.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2011 due to operating leverage on higher sales volume as well as a $5.5 million one-time reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses. This reduction is due to the cumulative effect of an accounting system error which caused the cost of goods sold to be overstated for several years by quarterly and annually immaterial amounts. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 20.8%, as compared to 21.5% in the prior year, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating profit margin was 30.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $3 million over the year ended December 31, 2011. Organic sales were flat as growth in toll and traffic systems was offset by a large installation project in gas network monitoring during 2011 that has since been completed. Gross margin was 52.4% in 2012 as compared to 50.6% in the prior year due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2012 were 26.1%, a decrease from 26.8% in the prior year due to lower spending, particularly in selling expense related to toll projects. Operating profit margin was 26.3% in 2012 as compared to 23.8% in 2011. Corporate expenses increased by $20.6 million to $77.5 million, or 2.6% of sales, in 2012 as compared to $56.9 million, or 2.0% of sales, in 2011. The increase was due to $6.5 million of acquisition expense related to the Sunquest acquisition, higher equity compensation (as a result of higher stock prices) and other compensation related costs. Interest expense increased $3.9 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2012. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2.3 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.1 million, which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note. During 2012, our effective income tax rate was 29.6% versus 29.4% in 2011. This increase was due to a decrease in R&D credits. At December 31, 2012, the functional currencies of our Canadian and most of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $24.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Approximately $12.7 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2012, operating profit decreased by 1.3% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2012 2011 change Industrial Technology $ 783,362 $ 767,020 2.1 % Energy Systems and Controls 634,051 608,538 4.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 703,034 612,787 14.7 RF Technology 871,225 834,903 4.4 Total $ 2,991,672 $ 2,823,248 6.0 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 2%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $124 million. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2012. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced negative internal growth, offset by bookings from recent acquisitions. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2012 2011 change Industrial Technology $ 131,621 $ 141,836 (7.2 )% Energy Systems and Controls 109,885 120,497 (8.8 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 234,526 118,609 97.7 RF Technology 471,185 447,355 5.3 Total $ 947,217 $ 828,297 14.4 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 802.6 $ 677.9 $ 601.6 Investing activities (1,115.9 ) (1,505.6 ) (275.7 ) Financing activities 403.6 853.9 (256.7 ) Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions and improved receivables collection. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was primarily for business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during all periods presented was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $282 million at December 31, 2013 compared to $308 million at December 31, 2012. We acquired net working capital of $12 million through business acquisitions during 2013. Total debt was $2.5 billion at December 31, 2013 (36.9% of total capital) compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2012 (35.4% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 was due to debt borrowings for acquisitions, partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. At December 31, 2013, we had $250 million of outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, $400 million of senior notes due 2017, $800 million of senior notes due 2018, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, $500 million of senior notes due 2022 and $8 million of senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034. In addition, we had $6.5 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $41.0 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2013, of which $36.0 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. On June 6, 2013, we completed a public offering of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.050% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2018. The notes were issued at 99.791% of their principal amount. The terms of the notes are described below under the heading ""Description of Certain Indebtedness-Senior Notes due 2018."" The net proceeds were used to pay a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under our revolving credit facility. On August 15, 2013, our $500 million of senior notes due 2013 matured, and were repaid using borrowings from our revolving credit facility. Cash and short-term investments at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 totaled $386 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, our unsecured credit facility, as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2013. Capital expenditures of $42.5 million, $38.4 million and $40.7 million were incurred during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 27, 2012, we entered into a new unsecured credit facility (the ""2012 Facility""), composed of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The 2012 Facility replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of July 7, 2008 (the ""2008 Facility""). Due to the early termination of the 2008 Facility, we recorded a $1.0 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge, reported as other expense, in the third quarter of 2012 reflecting the unamortized fees associated with the 2008 Facility. At December 31, 2013, there were $250 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Facility. The 2012 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes – Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2018 – On June 6, 2013, we completed a public offering of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.050% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2018. The notes were issued at 99.791% of their principal amount. Net proceeds of $793.5 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.050% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2017 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.850% senior unsecured notes due November 2017. Net proceeds of $397.2 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.850% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2022 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes due November 2022. Net proceeds of $496.4 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under the 2008 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2013 - On August 15, 2013, our $500 million of senior notes due 2013 matured, and were repaid using revolver borrowings from the 2012 Facility. On August 15, 2013 an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2009 expired. The swaps had been designated as fair value hedges which had effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 to a variable-rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the 3 month London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""). Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semi-annually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. As of January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at our option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long-term to short-term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. We include in our diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2013 (in thousands).

We have excluded $26.9 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term portion of the liability. See Note 7 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding surety bonds of $410 million. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2014 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2013, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $1.5 billion variable-rate revolver with outstanding borrowings of $250 million at December 31, 2013. Our $400 million senior notes due 2017, $800 million senior notes due 2018, $500 million senior notes due 2019 and $500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1.850%, 2.050%, 3.125% and 6.250%, respectively, and our $8 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2013, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 1.5% higher and 1.6% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2013, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were $250 million of outstanding revolver borrowings; an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $2.5 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 24% of our total sales in 2013 and 61% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar was stronger against most of our non-U.S. subsidiary currencies throughout most of 2013 as compared to 2012, which resulted in a decrease in sales of less than 1.0% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2013 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.1%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2013 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2012 resulted in a pre-tax decrease in net assets of $17.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $9.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.",2023-12-30 21:34:28.043375
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2015,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets; including healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education and academic research. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms. In the third quarter of 2014, we acquired the shares of Foodlink Holdings, Inc. (""Foodlink""), Innovative Product Achievements, LLC (""IPA"") and Strategic Healthcare Programs Holdings, LLC (""SHP"") which expand upon our existing supply chain and medical platforms. 14 Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.8 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.9 million, for a total of $13.7 million, or 2.6% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2014 was $1.3 million lower than at December 31, 2013. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2014, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $38.9 million, or 16.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $43.5 million, or 17.5% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2013. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we recognized revenue of $266 million, $205 million and $146 million, respectively, using this method. Percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects. At December 31, 2014, $225 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. 15 Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2014, our effective income tax rate was 29.9%, which was higher than the 2013 rate of 28.6% due to an increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the non-recurrence of $6 million in tax benefits recognized in 2013 related in part to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""ATRA"") on January 2, 2013. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2015 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter, (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two-step process. The first step utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. We have 29 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $994 million. We concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of December 31, 2014. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. In 2013, we reported that the fair value of one of our reporting units in the RF Technology segment was less than 5% above its carrying value at December 31, 2013 using the discounted cash flow methodology, but that we believed that the market value of the unit to be significantly in excess of its carrying value based upon observed market data. The test performed in December, 2014 indicated that the fair value of this unit at December 31, 2014 exceeded the carrying value by more than 20%. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2014. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required. 16 Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

(3) Includes results from the acquisition of Foodlink from July 2, 2014. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $3.55 billion as compared to sales of $3.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 10%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 7% and contributions from acquisitions of 3%. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $178 million or 20% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the year ended December 31, 2013. Acquisitions added $91 million in sales, and organic sales increased 10% due to increased sales in our medical businesses. Gross margin increased to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 69.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 37.4% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 39.5% in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 34.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 29.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013. 17 In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $46 million or 5% over the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic, university card systems and security solutions businesses. Gross margin was 52.8% in 2014 as compared to 53.7% in the prior year due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 were 24.3%, a decrease from 25.6% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 28.5% in 2014 as compared to 28.0% in 2013. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $48 million or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the year ended December 31, 2013. Organic growth was 7%, and there was a negative 1% impact from foreign currency exchange. The organic growth was due primarily to increased sales in our water meter, fluid handling and materials testing businesses. Gross margin was 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 51.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 20.5%, as compared to 22.5% in the prior year, due primarily to the non-recurrence of a $9.1 million pretax charge for warranty expense in 2013. The resulting operating margin was 29.9% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 28.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $40 million or 6% over the year ended December 31, 2013. Organic sales increased by 5% due to sales of new instruments for refinery applications and increased sales in the fluid properties testing equipment market. Gross margin was 58.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2013, due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.9% as compared to 29.2% in the prior year due to product mix. Operating margin was 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2013. Corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014 as compared to $86.1 million, or 2.7% of sales, in 2013. The increase was due to higher compensation costs, including increased equity compensation (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Interest expense decreased $9.4 million, or 10.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates throughout 2014. Other income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement. During 2014, our effective income tax rate was 29.9% versus 28.6% in 2013. The increase was due to one-time discrete tax benefits in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 as well as increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2015 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. At December 31, 2014, the functional currencies of most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2013. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $118.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Approximately $50.5 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2014, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2014 2013 change Industrial Technology $ 808,921 $ 772,337 4.7 % Energy Systems and Controls 692,136 673,569 2.8 Medical and Scientific Imaging 1,081,190 958,830 12.8 RF Technology 955,831 943,757 1.3 Total $ 3,538,078 $ 3,348,493 5.7 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 3% and orders from acquisitions which added 3%.

We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2014 2013 change Industrial Technology $ 97,507 $ 121,943 (20.0 )% Energy Systems and Controls 126,838 131,799 (3.8 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 296,098 290,435 1.9 RF Technology 520,727 510,553 2.0 Total $ 1,041,170 $ 1,054,730 (1.3 )% 18 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $3.24 billion as compared to sales of $2.99 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 8%. The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 7% and organic sales growth of 1%. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $198 million or 28% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 over the year ended December 31, 2012. Acquisitions added $208 million in sales, while organic sales decreased 1% due to a $20 million decrease in camera sales which was offset in part by increased sales in our medical businesses of $15 million. Gross margin increased to 69.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 64.4% in the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 39.5% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 37.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 due to higher SG&A expense structures at our medical businesses as well as SG&A expenses at MHA in which the corresponding revenues were not recognizable under GAAP (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Operating margin was 29.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 26.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $56 million or 7% over the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic, university card systems and security solutions businesses. Gross margin was 53.7% in 2013 as compared to 52.4% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2013 were 25.6%, a decrease from 26.1% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 28.0% in 2013 as compared to 26.3% in 2012. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $16 million or 2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 over the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was due primarily to the loss of a customer at our water metering business and lower sales at our materials testing business. Gross margin was 51.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 51.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012 due to negative operating leverage on lower sales volume as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a one-time $5.5 million reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 22.5%, as compared to 20.8% in the prior year, due primarily to a $9.1 million pretax charge for warranty expense at one of our subsidiaries, Hansen Technologies, to provide its customers with replacements for refrigeration valves that included a vendor-supplied component that did not meet Roper quality standards. The resulting operating margin was 28.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 30.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $6 million or 1% over the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to acquisitions. Organic sales were impacted by lower sales of non-destructive testing systems for nuclear plants and pressure sensors for industrial applications, offset by increased demand for control systems for oil and gas applications. Gross margin was 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 56.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012, due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.2% as compared to 28.4% in the prior year due to product mix. Operating margin was 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 27.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012. Corporate expenses increased by $8.6 million to $86.1 million, or 2.7% of sales, in 2013 as compared to $77.5 million, or 2.6% of sales, in 2012. The increase was due to higher equity compensation (primarily as a result of higher stock prices), offset in part by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses. Interest expense increased $20.5 million, or 30.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2013. Other expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was composed of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2.3 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. During 2013, our effective income tax rate was 28.6% versus 29.6% in 2012. The reduction was due to $6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""ATRA""), as well as a $6 million benefit from the correction of an out of period adjustment of tax balances which were immaterial to any covered period, offset in part by increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the non-recurrence of the $6 million tax benefit recognized in 2013. At December 31, 2013, the functional currencies of most of our European subsidiaries were stronger and our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2012. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $17.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Approximately $9.5 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2013, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. 19 The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2013 2012 change Industrial Technology $ 772,337 $ 783,362 (1.4 )% Energy Systems and Controls 673,569 634,051 6.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 958,830 703,034 36.4 RF Technology 943,757 871,225 8.3 Total $ 3,348,493 $ 2,991,672 11.9 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 4%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added 8%. Our Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2013. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced internal growth of 3%, as well as orders from recent acquisitions. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2013 2012 change Industrial Technology $ 121,943 $ 131,621 (7.4 )% Energy Systems and Controls 131,799 109,885 19.9 Medical and Scientific Imaging 290,435 234,526 23.8 RF Technology 510,553 471,185 8.4 Total $ 1,054,730 $ 947,217 11.4 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 are as follows (in millions): 2014 2013 2012 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 840.4 $ 802.6 $ 677.9 Investing activities (348.1 ) (1,115.9 ) (1,505.5 ) Financing activities (298.1 ) 403.6 853.9 Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions offset in part by tax payments. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2014, 2013, and 2012 was primarily for business acquisitions. Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during all periods presented was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $285 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $282 million at December 31, 2013. We acquired net working capital of $0.2 million through business acquisitions during 2014. Total debt was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2014 (31.8% of total capital) compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2013 (36.9% of total capital). Our decreased debt at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 was due to debt payments made using cash from operations. At December 31, 2014, we had $400 million of senior notes due 2017, $800 million of senior notes due 2018, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, $500 million of senior notes due 2022 and $8 million of senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034. In addition, we had $6.1 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $48.9 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2014, of which $43.7 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately. Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 totaled $535 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, our unsecured credit facility, as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 20 We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the year ended December 31, 2014. Capital expenditures of $37.6 million, $42.5 million and $38.4 million were incurred during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility - On July 27, 2012, we entered into a new unsecured credit facility (the ""2012 Facility""), composed of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The 2012 Facility replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of July 7, 2008 (the ""2008 Facility""). Due to the early termination of the 2008 Facility, we recorded a $1.0 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge, reported as other expense, in the third quarter of 2012 reflecting the unamortized fees associated with the 2008 Facility. At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Facility. The 2012 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes – Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2018 – On June 6, 2013, we completed a public offering of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.050% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2018. The notes were issued at 99.791% of their principal amount. Net proceeds of $793.5 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.050% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2017 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.850% senior unsecured notes due November 2017. Net proceeds of $397.2 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.850% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2022 - In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes due November 2022. Net proceeds of $496.4 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under the 2012 Facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2013. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Notes due 2019 - In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under the 2008 Facility. 21 The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes - In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semi-annually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. As of January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at our option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long-term to short-term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. We include in our diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2014 (in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Year Contractual Cash Obligations1 Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 2,208,003 $ 8,003 $ - $ 400,000 $ 800,000 $ 500,000 $ 500,000 Senior note interest 346,872 70,675 70,675 69,750 54,392 36,458 44,922 Capital leases 6,120 3,089 2,332 630 66 3 - Operating leases 122,494 40,169 31,852 21,426 11,928 6,070 11,049 Total $ 2,683,489 $ 121,936 $ 104,859 $ 491,806 $ 866,386 $ 542,531 $ 555,971 22 Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 48,934 $ 26,846 $ 1,950 $ 816 $ 113 $ 3,088 $ 16,121 1 We have excluded $29 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term portion of the liability. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2014, we had $428 million of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2014 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2014, we had $2.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings. Our $400 million senior notes due 2017, $800 million senior notes due 2018, $500 million senior notes due 2019 and $500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1.850%, 2.050%, 3.125% and 6.250%, respectively, and our $8 million senior subordinated convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2014, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.8% higher and 2.8% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $1.5 billion variable-rate revolver with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2014. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 23% of our total sales in 2014 and 61% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar was stronger against most of our non-U.S. subsidiary currencies throughout most of 2014 as compared to 2013, which resulted in a decrease in sales of less than 1.0% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2014 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1.7%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2014 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2013 resulted in a pre-tax decrease in net assets of $118.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $50.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 23",2023-12-30 21:34:21.716018
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets; including healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education and academic research. 16 We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms. In 2015, we acquired Strata Decision Technologies LLC (""Strata""), Softwriters Inc., Data Innovations LLC, On Center Software LLC (""On Center""), RF IDeas, Inc., Atlantic Health Partners LLC (""AHP""), Aderant Holdings, Inc. (""Aderant""), and Atlas Database Software Corp. (""Atlas""). The acquisitions both expanded and complemented our existing technologies. We also divested Abel Pumps and Black Diamond Advanced Technologies in the current year. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.0 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $12.4 million, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2015 was $1.3 million lower than at December 31, 2014. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2015, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $34.0 million, or 15.2% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $38.9 million, or 16.7% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2014. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. 17 Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recognized revenue of $253 million, $266 million and $205 million, respectively, using this method. Percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects. At December 31, 2015, $276 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2015, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 29.9%. The taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points, and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters. We expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2016 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter, (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. 18 We have 32 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $1.2 billion. In 2015, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. We conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. We determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 29 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units. For the remaining three reporting units we performed our quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these three reporting units was in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of December 31, 2015. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative review using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth. The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2015. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required. 19 Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.58 billion as compared to sales of $3.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 1%. The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 4%, negative organic growth of 0.3% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 3%. 20 Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $135 million or 12.5% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the year ended December 31, 2014. Acquisitions contributed 11.5%, organic sales increased 3.8% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 2.8%. The increase in organic sales was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by Verathon and Managed Health Care Associates (""MHA""). Gross margin increased to 74.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively unchanged at 37.7% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 37.4% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin was 36.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 34.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $84 million or 9% over the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales increased by 6%, acquisitions along with the divestiture of the Black Diamond Advanced Technology business added 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic sales was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic and freight matching businesses. Gross margin was 53.4% in 2015 as compared to 52.8% in the prior year due to leverage on higher sales volume and product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 were 23.3%, a decrease from 24.3% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 30.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.5% in 2014. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $82 million or 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales decreased by 4%, the negative foreign exhange impact was 4% and the divestiture of the Abel Pumps business accounted for a negative 2%. The decrease in organic sales was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets. Gross margin decreased to 49.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 50.5% in the year ended December 31, 2014 due to negative leverage on lower sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 21.0%, as compared to 20.5% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 28.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 29.9% in the year ended December 31, 2014. In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $104 million or 15% from the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales decreased by 10% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 5%. Gross margin was relatively unchanged at 58.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 58.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 30.5% as compared to 28.9% in the prior year due negative leverage on lower sales volume. Operating margin was 27.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Corporate expenses increased by $4.6 million to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of sales, in 2015 as compared to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014. The increase was due primarily to increased costs related to acquisitions. Interest expense increased $5.6 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2015. Other income of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of Abel Pumps (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment. Other income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals. During 2015, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 29.9%. The taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points, and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters. At December 31, 2015, the functional currencies of most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $146 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $62 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2015, operating profit decreased by approximately 2% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. 21 The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2015 2014 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 1,235,143 $ 1,081,190 14.2 % RF Technology 1,024,999 955,831 7.2 Industrial Technology 731,810 808,921 (9.5 ) Energy Systems & Controls 555,672 692,136 (19.7 ) Total $ 3,547,624 $ 3,538,078 0.3 % The increase in orders was due to orders from acquisitions which added 5%, offset by negative organic growth of 2% and a 3% negative foreign exchange impact.

The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 7% and contributions from acquisitions of 3%. Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $178 million or 20% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the year ended December 31, 2013. Acquisitions added $91 million in sales, and organic sales increased 10% due to increased sales in our medical businesses. Gross margin increased to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 69.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 37.4% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 39.5% in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 34.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 29.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $46 million or 5% over the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic, university card systems and security solutions businesses. Gross margin was 52.8% in 2014 as compared to 53.7% in the prior year due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 were 24.3%, a decrease from 25.6% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 28.5% in 2014 as compared to 28.0% in 2013. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $48 million or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the year ended December 31, 2013. Organic growth was 7%, and there was a negative 1% impact from foreign currency exchange. The organic growth was due primarily to increased sales in our water meter, fluid handling and materials testing businesses. Gross margin was 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 51.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 20.5%, as compared to 22.5% in the prior year, due primarily to the non-recurrence of a $9.1 million pretax charge for warranty expense in 2013. The resulting operating margin was 29.9% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 28.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013. In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $40 million or 6% over the year ended December 31, 2013. Organic sales increased by 5% due to sales of new instruments for refinery applications and increased sales in the fluid properties testing equipment market. Gross margin was 58.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2013, due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.9% as compared to 29.2% in the prior year due to product mix. Operating margin was 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 28.2% in the year ended December 31, 2013. 22 Corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014 as compared to $86.1 million, or 2.7% of sales, in 2013. The increase was due to higher compensation costs, including increased equity compensation (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Interest expense decreased $9.4 million, or 10.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates throughout 2014. Other income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million due to foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement. During 2014, our effective income tax rate was 29.9% versus 28.6% in 2013. The increase was due to one-time discrete tax benefits in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 as well as increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. At December 31, 2014, the functional currencies of most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2013. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $118.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Approximately $50.5 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2014, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2014 2013 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 1,081,190 $ 958,830 12.8 % RF Technology 955,831 943,757 1.3 Industrial Technology 808,921 772,337 4.7 Energy Systems & Controls 692,136 673,569 2.8 Total $ 3,538,078 $ 3,348,493 5.7 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 3% and orders from acquisitions which added 3%.

We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2014 2013 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 296,098 $ 290,435 1.9 % RF Technology 520,727 510,553 2.0 Industrial Technology 97,507 121,943 (20.0 ) Energy Systems & Controls 126,838 131,799 (3.8 ) Total $ 1,041,170 $ 1,054,730 (1.3 )% Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in millions): 2015 2014 2013 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 928.8 $ 840.4 $ 802.6 Investing activities (1,698.3 ) (348.1 ) (1,115.9 ) Financing activities 996.2 (298.1 ) 403.6 23 Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions and the collection of $49 million of receivables due from the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, offset in part by higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions offset in part by tax payments. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily for business acquisitions. Cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the Abel Pumps business. Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily from the issuance of $900 million of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions. Cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was primarily revolving debt borrowing for acquisitions, offset in part by debt payments made using cash from operations. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $126 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $285 million at December 31, 2014, due primarily to a net reduction in net working capital of $50 million due to the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) and a $49 million decrease in receivables related to the collection of amounts due from the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority. We acquired negative net working capital of $13 million through business acquisitions during 2015. The negative acquired working capital was due primarily to $69 million in deferred revenue balances. Total debt was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2015 (38.3% of total capital) compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2014 (31.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 was due to debt borrowings for 2015 acquisitions. On December 7, 2015, we completed a public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2020, issued at 99.962% of their principal amount, and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2025, issued at 99.362% of their principal amount. Net proceeds of $894 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility. The senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% and 3.85% per year, respectively, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2016. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. At December 31, 2015, we had $3.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $180 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and $4 million of senior subordinated convertible notes. In addition, we had $4 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $43 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2015, of which $39 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding our credit facility, senior notes and senior subordinated convertible notes. 24 Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 totaled $688 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, our unsecured credit facility, as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures of $36.3 million, $37.6 million and $42.5 million were incurred during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2015 (in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Year Contractual Cash Obligations1 Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 3,284,196 $ 4,196 $ 580,000 $ 800,000 $ 500,000 $ 600,000 $ 800,000 Senior note interest 485,249 100,225 99,300 88,725 66,008 44,425 86,566 Capital leases 4,418 2,609 1,296 460 53 - - Operating leases 157,172 41,045 34,210 22,375 15,053 11,897 32,592 Total $ 3,931,035 $ 148,075 $ 714,806 $ 911,560 $ 581,114 $ 656,322 $ 919,158 Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 43,314 $ 23,940 $ 3,170 $ 422 $ 201 $ 54 $ 15,527 1 We have excluded $26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term portion of the liability. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2015, we had $505 million of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2016 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 25 Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2015, we had $3.1 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 1.85% to 6.25%. At December 31, 2015, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 1.4% higher and 2.4% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $1.85 billion variable-rate revolver with $180 million of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 20% of our total sales in 2015 and 61% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2015 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1.6%. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 26",2023-12-30 21:34:32.555596
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets; including healthcare, transportation, commercial construction, food, energy, water, education and academic research. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms. In 2016, we acquired CliniSys Group Ltd. (""CliniSys""), PCI Medical Inc., GeneInsight Inc., iSqFt Holdings Inc. (d/b/a ConstructConnect) (""ConstructConnect""), UNIConnect LC, and Project Diamond Holdings Corp. (d/b/a Deltek Inc). The acquisitions both expanded and complemented our existing technologies. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting. 18 Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $12.2 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.3 million, for a total of $14.5 million, or 2.3% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2016 was $2.1 million higher than at December 31, 2015. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2016, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $37.2 million, or 17.0% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $34.0 million, or 15.2% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2015. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recognized revenue of $241 million, $253 million and $266 million, respectively, using this method. Percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects. At December 31, 2016, $260 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2016, our effective income tax rate was 30.0%, which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 30.6%, The decrease was due to the recognition of $15.3 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an accounting standards update related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as the non-recurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015. We expect the effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 30%. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter, (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). 19 When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. We have 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.2 billion. In 2016, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units, excluding those acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016. We conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. We determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 28 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units. For the remaining five reporting units we performed our quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these five reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of December 31, 2016. Recently acquired reporting units generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative review using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth. 20 The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2016. We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required. 21 Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 6.8%, negative organic growth of 0.3% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 0.7%. Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $147 million or 12% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 over the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisitions contributed 9%, organic sales increased 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic sales was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by NDI and Verathon. Gross margin decreased to 73.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 74.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to product mix. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 37.7% in the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a higher SG&A structure in our medical businesses. Operating margin was 35.0% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 36.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $176 million or 17% over the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisitions net of the divestiture of the Black Diamond Advanced Technology business added 15%, organic sales increased by 3%, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic sales was due primarily to increased sales in our software businesses offset in part by the completion of large service contracts in our toll and traffic businesses in 2015. Gross margin was 56.7% in 2016 as compared to 53.4% in the prior year due to product mix in our toll and traffic businesses as well as an increased percentage of sales at our software businesses which have a higher gross margin. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to 25.9%, as compared to 23.3% in the prior year due primarily to an increased percentage of sales at our software businesses which have a higher SG&A structure. Operating margin was 30.8% in 2016 as compared to 30.2% in 2015. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $39 million or 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. The divestiture of the Abel Pumps business in 2015 accounted for a negative 3.1%, organic sales decreased by 1.5% and the negative foreign exhange impact was 0.6%. The decrease in organic sales was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets, offset in part by increased sales in our water metering business. Gross margin increased to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 21.9%, as compared to 21.0% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 28.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 28.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015. In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $78 million or 13% from the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales decreased by 12% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. Gross margin decreased to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 58.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.7% as compared to 30.5% in the prior year, both of which were due negative leverage on lower sales volume. Operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 27.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Corporate expenses increased by $24.7 million to $127.5 million, or 3.4% of sales, in 2016 as compared to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of sales, in 2015. The increase was due primarily to increased equity compensation costs as a result of both an increase in the number of shares granted in the current year and increases in our common stock price and increased costs related to acquisitions. Interest expense increased $27.3 million, or 32.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund current year acquisitions as well as higher average interest rates throughout 2016. Other expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by royalty income. Other income of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of Abel Pumps (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment. 23 During 2016, our effective income tax rate was 30.0%, which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 30.6%. The decrease was due to the recognition of $15.3 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an ASU related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as the non-recurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015. At December 31, 2016, the functional currencies of most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were weaker, and the Canadian dollar was stronger, against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2015. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $115 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $52 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2016, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2016 2015 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 1,399,007 $ 1,235,143 13.3 % RF Technology 1,278,246 1,024,999 24.7 Industrial Technology 704,622 731,810 (3.7 ) Energy Systems & Controls 514,300 555,672 (7.4 ) Total $ 3,896,175 $ 3,547,624 9.8 % The increase in orders was due to orders from acquisitions which added 8%, organic growth of 3% and a 1% negative foreign exchange impact. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months.

The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 4%, negative organic growth of 0.3% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 3%. Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $135 million or 12.5% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the year ended December 31, 2014. Acquisitions contributed 11.5%, organic sales increased 3.8% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 2.8%. The increase in organic sales was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by Verathon and Managed Health Care Associates (""MHA""). Gross margin increased to 74.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively unchanged at 37.7% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 37.4% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin was 36.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 34.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014. 24 In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $84 million or 9% over the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales increased by 6%, acquisitions net of the divestiture of the Black Diamond Advanced Technology business added 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic sales was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic and freight matching businesses. Gross margin was 53.4% in 2015 as compared to 52.8% in the prior year due to leverage on higher sales volume and product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 were 23.3%, a decrease from 24.3% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. Operating margin was 30.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.5% in 2014. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $82 million or 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales decreased by 4%, the negative foreign exhange impact was 4% and the divestiture of the Abel Pumps business accounted for a negative 2%. The decrease in organic sales was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets. Gross margin decreased to 49.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 50.5% in the year ended December 31, 2014 due to negative leverage on lower sales volume. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 21.0%, as compared to 20.5% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 28.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 29.9% in the year ended December 31, 2014. In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $104 million or 15% from the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales decreased by 10% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 5%. Gross margin was relatively unchanged at 58.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 58.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 30.5% as compared to 28.9% in the prior year due negative leverage on lower sales volume. Operating margin was 27.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Corporate expenses increased by $4.6 million to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of sales, in 2015 as compared to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014. The increase was due primarily to increased costs related to acquisitions. Interest expense increased $5.6 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2015. Other income of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of Abel Pumps (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment. Other income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals. During 2015, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 29.9%. The taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points, and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters. At December 31, 2015, the functional currencies of most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014. The net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $146 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $62 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2015, operating profit decreased by approximately 2% due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies. 25 The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2015 2014 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 1,235,143 $ 1,081,190 14.2 % RF Technology 1,024,999 955,831 7.2 Industrial Technology 731,810 808,921 (9.5 ) Energy Systems & Controls 555,672 692,136 (19.7 ) Total $ 3,547,624 $ 3,538,078 0.3 % The increase in orders was due to orders from acquisitions which added 5%, offset by negative organic growth of 2% and a 3% negative foreign exchange impact. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2015 2014 change Medical & Scientific Imaging $ 373,213 $ 296,098 26.0 % RF Technology 538,877 520,727 3.5 Industrial Technology 68,002 97,507 (30.3 ) Energy Systems & Controls 90,365 126,838 (28.8 ) Total $ 1,070,457 $ 1,041,170 2.8 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 964 $ 929 $ 840 Investing activities (3,753 ) (1,698 ) (348 ) Financing activities 2,805 996 (298 ) Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash charges and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products, offset in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the Abel Pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions, the collection of $49 million of receivables due from the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was primarily for business acquisitions. Cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the Abel Pumps business. Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions. Cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily the issuance of $900 million of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions. 26 Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was a negative $25 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $126 million at December 31, 2015, due primarily to increases in deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products. We acquired negative net working capital of $128 million through business acquisitions during 2016. The negative acquired working capital was due primarily to $203 million in deferred revenue balances. Total debt was $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 (51.8% of total capital) compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2015 (38.3% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was due to debt borrowings for 2016 acquisitions. On December 19, 2016, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.80% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2021, issued at 99.843% of their principal amount, and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2026, issued at 99.984% of their principal amount. Net proceeds of $1.19 billion were used in the acquisition of Deltek (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.80% and 3.80% per year, respectively, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2017. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. On September 23, 2016, we entered into a new five-year unsecured credit facility (the ""2016 Facility"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of July 27, 2012, as amended as of October 28, 2015 (the ""2012 Facility""). The 2016 Facility comprises a five year $2.50 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 million for letters of credit. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500 million. We recorded as other expense a $0.9 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge in the fourth quarter related to the early termination of the 2012 Facility, which represented the unamortized fees associated with the 2012 Facility. The 2016 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1. On December 2, 2016, we amended the 2016 Facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.0 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment, 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquistion (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, we had $4.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and $1.93 billion of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $3.0 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $74.1 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2016, of which $34.8 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. 27 See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes. Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 totaled $557 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our U.S. operations, our unsecured credit facility, as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures of $37.3 million, $36.3 million and $37.6 million were incurred during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016 (in thousands).

See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2016, we had $521 million of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2017 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. 28 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2016, we had $4.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 1.85% to 6.25%. At December 31, 2016, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.9% higher and 2.9% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $1.93 billion of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2016. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 20% of our total sales in 2016 and 61% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2016 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2%. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 29",2023-12-30 21:34:31.619559
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with ""Selected Financial Data"" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. OverviewWe are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms.Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $12.7 million, or 1.9% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $14.5 million, or 2.3% of total gross accounts receivable, at December 31, 2016. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2017, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $38.1 million, or 15.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $37.2 million, or 17.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 182016. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.Most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.Revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recognized revenue of $249 million, $241 million and $253 million, respectively, using this method. Percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects. At December 31, 2017, $253 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2017, our effective income tax rate was 6.1%, as compared to the 2016 rate of 30.0%. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a $215 million net income tax benefit related to the Tax Act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 21% and 23%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.We have 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.3 billion. In 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. We conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. We determined that 19impairment of goodwill was not likely in 31 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units. For the remaining two reporting units, the Company performed its quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2017. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative review using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2017.We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.20Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 16.3%, organic growth of 5.3% and no impact from foreign exchange.In our RF Technology segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $651.9 million or 54% over the year ended December 31, 2016. Acquisitions accounted for 51% and organic revenues increased by 3%. The increase in organic revenues was due primarily to growth in our software businesses. Gross margin was 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 56.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 35.3%, as compared to 25.9% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher SG&A structure, including amortization of acquired intangibles. The resulting operating margin was 25.7% in 2017 as compared to 30.8% in 2016.Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $47.5 million or 3% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the year ended December 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our medical products businesses, led by NDI, and our alternate site healthcare businesses. Gross margin decreased to 72.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 73.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix at both our software and medical products businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales. The resulting operating margin was 34.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 35.0% in the year ended December 31, 2016.Net revenues for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $77.1 million or 11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. The growth in organic revenues was broad-based, due primarily to our fluid handling, water meter technology and materials testing businesses. Gross margin was consistent at 50.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 20.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 28.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016.In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $41.1 million or 8% from the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased by 7% and the benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions totaled 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in pressure sensors and valves businesses serving energy markets as well as businesses serving industrial end markets. Gross margin increased to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 31.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. As a result, operating margin was 27.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2016.Corporate expenses increased by $14.3 million to $141.8 million, or 3.1% of revenues, in 2017 as compared to $127.5 million, or 3.4% of revenues, in 2016. The dollar increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional services.Interest expense increased $69.0 million, or 61.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund acquisitions at the end of 2016.Other income, net, of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was composed primarily of a $9.4 million gain on sale of a product line in our Energy Systems & Controls segment, offset in part by a $1.8 million charge on a minority investment and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by royalty income. During 2017, our effective income tax rate was 6.1% as compared to our 2016 rate of 30.0%. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a $215 million net income tax benefit related to the Tax Act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016.The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 22 2017 2016 changeRF Technology$991,382 $991,212 —%Medical & Scientific Imaging467,836 423,616 10.4Industrial Technology110,841 65,259 69.8Energy Systems & Controls102,293 92,309 10.8Total$1,672,352 $1,572,396 6.4%Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.79 billion as compared to $3.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 5.8%. The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 6.8%, negative organic growth of 0.3% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 0.7%.In our RF Technology segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $176 million or 17% over the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisitions net of the divestiture of the Black Diamond Advanced Technology business added 15%, organic revenues increased by 3%, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our software businesses, offset in part by the completion of large service contracts in our toll and traffic businesses in 2015. Gross margin was 56.7% in 2016 as compared to 53.4% in the prior year due to product mix in our toll and traffic businesses as well as an increased percentage of revenues at our software businesses which have a higher gross margin. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to 25.9%, as compared to 23.3% in the prior year due primarily to an increased percentage of net revenues at our software businesses which have a higher SG&A structure. Operating margin was 30.8% in 2016 as compared to 30.2% in 2015.Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $147 million or 12% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 over the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisitions contributed 9%, organic revenues increased 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The increase in organic revenues was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by NDI and Verathon. Gross margin decreased to 73.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 74.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 37.7% in the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a higher SG&A structure in our medical businesses. Operating margin was 35.0% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 36.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015.Net revenues for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $39 million or 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. The divestiture of the Abel Pumps business in 2015 accounted for a negative 3.1%, organic revenues decreased by 1.5% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 0.6%. The decrease in organic revenues was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets, offset in part by increased sales in our water metering business. Gross margin increased to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 49.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 21.9%, as compared to 21.0% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 28.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 28.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015.In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $78 million or 13% from the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic revenues decreased by 12% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. Gross margin decreased to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 58.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 31.7% as compared to 30.5% in the prior year, both of which were due to negative leverage on lower sales volume. Operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 27.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015.Corporate expenses increased by $24.7 million to $127.5 million, or 3.4% of net revenues, in 2016 as compared to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of net revenues, in 2015. The increase was due primarily to increased equity compensation costs as a result of both an increase in the number of shares granted in the current year and increases in our common stock price and increased costs related to acquisitions.Interest expense increased $27.3 million, or 32.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund current year acquisitions as well as higher average interest rates throughout 2016.23Other expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by royalty income. Other income of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of Abel Pumps (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment. During 2016, our effective income tax rate was 30.0%, which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 30.6%. The decrease was due to the recognition of $15.3 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an ASU related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), as well as the non-recurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of Abel Pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015.The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands). We include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. 2016 2015 changeRF Technology$991,212 $538,877 83.9 %Medical & Scientific Imaging423,616 373,213 13.5 %Industrial Technology65,259 68,002 (4.0)%Energy Systems & Controls92,309 90,365 2.2 %Total$1,572,396 $1,070,457 46.9 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities$1,234 $964 $929Investing activities(210) (3,753) (1,698)Financing activities(1,170) 2,805 996Operating activities - The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 and in 2016 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash expenses and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was offset in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the Abel Pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was primarily for business acquisitions. Cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the Abel Pumps business.Financing activities - Cash used in/provided by financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments/borrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $660 million and the repayment of $400 million of senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions.Cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $59 million as compared to decreases during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $38 million and $59 million, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the strengthening of functional currencies of our European subsidiaries against the U.S. dollar, while the decreases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to the weakening of functional currencies of our European subsidiaries against the U.S. dollar. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was a negative $140 million at December 31, 2017 compared to negative $25 million at December 31, 2016, due primarily to increased deferred revenues. This deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services along with the impact of fair value purchase accounting resulting from 2016 acquisitions.24Total debt was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2017 (43.0% of total capital) compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 (51.8% of total capital). Our decreased debt at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was due primarily to the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $660 million and the repayment of $400 million of senior notes.On September 23, 2016, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit facility (the ""2016 Facility"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of July 27, 2012, as amended as of October 28, 2015 (the ""2012 Facility""). The 2016 Facility comprises a five year $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150 million for letters of credit. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500 million. The 2016 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1.On December 2, 2016, we amended the 2016 Facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.0 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment, 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquistion (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017.At December 31, 2017, we had $3.9 billion of senior unsecured notes and $1.3 billion of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $3.1 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $75.9 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2017, of which $33.1 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 totaled $592 million. The Tax Act included a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax on all undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in a charge of $110.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company will elect to pay the liability over 8 years. In addition, the introduction of a modified territorial taxation system resulted in a one-time estimated charge of $28.7 million due to the Company’s change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion on foreign earnings. The Company now intends to distribute all historical earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax and has provided for deferred taxes related to the future state and foreign tax cost to repatriate. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.Capital expenditures of $48.8 million, $37.3 million and $36.3 million were incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $10.8 million, $2.8 million and $2.4 million were incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to our 2016 acquisitions. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.25Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2017 (in thousands).

See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.As of December 31, 2017, we had $573.4 million of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2018 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.26ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2017, we had $3.9 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.05% to 6.25%. At December 31, 2017, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.05% higher and 3.85% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $1.27 billion of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2017.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 17% of our total revenues in 2017 and 68% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2017 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.27",2023-12-30 21:34:34.528215

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. OverviewWe are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses.Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition, income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2018, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $17.3 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $5.8, for a total of $23.1, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $12.7, or 1.9% of total gross accounts receivable, at December 31, 2017. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2018, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 18$30.3, or 13.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $38.1, or 15.7% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2017. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.Most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.Revenues from our project-based businesses, including toll and traffic systems, control systems and installations of large software application projects, are generally recognized over time using the input method, primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs, as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of $245.9, $249.3 and $241.3 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, using this method. At December 31, 2018, $241.6 of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2018, our effective income tax rate was 21.2%, as compared to the 2017 rate of 6.1%. The increase was due primarily to the recognition of a $215.4 net income tax benefit related to the Tax Act in 2017, partially offset by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. We expect the effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 21% and 23%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.Roper has 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.4 billion. In 2018, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and 19assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 30 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units. For the remaining three reporting units, the Company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of each of these three reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2018. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.The Company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of four of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2018. Of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis, one, associated with our lab software business, had a fair value that approximated its carrying value, which was $100.4 as of October 1, 2018. Holding other assumptions constant, for the specific trade name associated with our lab software business, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $6.8 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an $11.7 impairment.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2018.The most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.20Results of OperationsAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are net of revenuesPercentages may not sum due to rounding.The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The increase was the result of organic growth of 9.4%, a net effect from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.9%, and foreign exchange benefit of 0.4%.In our RF Technology segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $306.3 or 16% over the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic revenues increased by 9% and acquisitions accounted for 7% of our growth. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based strength across our software businesses and the non-recurrence of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our 2016 Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions. Gross margin was 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have higher gross margins, including the net reduction of purchase accounting adjustments. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 35.6%, as compared to 35.3% in the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher SG&A structure, including amortization of acquired intangibles. The resulting operating margin was 28.3% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 25.7% in the year ended December 31, 2017.Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $112.0 or 8% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 over the year ended December 31, 2017, all of which was attributable to organic growth. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based growth in our imaging and medical products businesses. Gross margin decreased to 71.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 72.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to growth in our lower margin imaging businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 37.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenues at our imaging businesses. The resulting operating margin was 34.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 34.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017.Net revenues for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $116.3 or 15% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic revenues increased 14% and the foreign exchange benefit was 1%. The growth in organic revenues was broad-based, due primarily to our fluid handling and water meter technology. Gross margin increased to 50.9% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 50.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 19.3% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 20.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, both of which were due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 31.6% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017.In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $49.1 or 9% from the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic sales increased by 7% and the foreign exchange benefit was 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based growth in our businesses serving energy and industrial end markets. Gross margin increased to 58.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 28.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. As a result, operating margin was 30.1% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 27.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017.Corporate expenses increased by $61.7 to $203.5, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2018 as compared to $141.8, or 3.1% of revenues, in 2017. The increase was due primarily to (i) $35.0 of accelerated vesting associated with the passing of our former executive chairman, (ii) increased equity compensation as a result of increases in our common stock price and (iii) acquisition-related expenses.Interest expense, net, increased $1.5, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by lower weighted average debt balances.Loss on debt extinguishment of $15.9 for the for the year ended December 31, 2018, incurred in connection with the redemption of the 2019 Notes (as defined below), was composed of the early redemption premium and remaining unamortized deferred financing costs.Other income, net, of $0.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 was composed primarily of royalty income, offset entirely by various other immaterial expenses. Other income, net of $5.1 for the year ended December 31, 2017 was composed primarily of a $9.4 gain on sale of a product line in our Energy Systems & Controls segment, offset in part by a $1.8 charge on a minority investment and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. 22During 2018, our effective income tax rate was 21.2% as compared to our 2017 rate of 6.1%. The increase was due primarily to the recognition of a $215.4 net income tax benefit related to the Tax Act in 2017, partially offset by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2018 2017 changeRF Technology$1,005.9 $991.4 1.5 %Medical & Scientific Imaging468.0 467.8 —Industrial Technology119.2 110.9 7.5Energy Systems & Controls99.7 102.3 (2.5)Total$1,692.8 $1,672.4 1.2 %Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4.61 billion as compared to $3.79 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 21.6%. The increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 16.3%, organic growth of 5.3% and no impact from foreign exchange.In our RF Technology segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $651.9 or 54% over the year ended December 31, 2016. Acquisitions accounted for 51% and organic revenues increased by 3%. The increase in organic revenues was due primarily to growth in our software businesses. Gross margin was 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 56.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher gross margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 35.3%, as compared to 25.9% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher SG&A structure, including amortization of acquired intangibles. The resulting operating margin was 25.7% in 2017 as compared to 30.8% in 2016.Our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment reported a $47.5 or 3% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the year ended December 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our medical products businesses, led by NDI, and our alternate site healthcare businesses. Gross margin decreased to 72.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 73.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix at both our software and medical products businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales. The resulting operating margin was 34.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 35.0% in the year ended December 31, 2016.Net revenues for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $77.1 or 11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. The growth in organic revenues was broad-based, due primarily to our fluid handling, water meter technology and materials testing businesses. Gross margin was consistent at 50.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 20.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 28.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016.In our Energy Systems & Controls segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $41.1 or 8% from the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased by 7% and the benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions totaled 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in pressure sensors and valves businesses serving energy markets as well as businesses serving industrial end markets. Gross margin increased to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 30.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 31.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. As a result, operating margin was 27.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2016.23Corporate expenses increased by $14.3 to $141.8, or 3.1% of revenues, in 2017 as compared to $127.5, or 3.4% of revenues, in 2016. The dollar increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional services.Interest expense increased $69.0, or 61.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund acquisitions at the end of 2016.Other income, net, of $5.1 for the year ended December 31, 2017 was composed primarily of a $9.4 gain on sale of a product line in our Energy Systems & Controls segment, offset in part by a $1.8 charge on a minority investment and foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies. Other expense of $1.5 for the year ended December 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based companies, offset in part by royalty income. During 2017, our effective income tax rate was 6.1% as compared to our 2016 rate of 30.0%. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a $215.4 net income tax benefit related to the Tax Act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2017 2016 changeRF Technology$991.4 $991.2 —%Medical & Scientific Imaging467.8 423.6 10.4%Industrial Technology110.9 65.3 69.8%Energy Systems & Controls102.3 92.3 10.8%Total$1,672.4 $1,572.4 6.4% Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2018 2017 2016Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities$1,430.1 $1,234.5 $963.8Investing activities(1,335.1) (209.6) (3,752.9)Financing activities(388.1) (1,170.0) 2,805.3Operating activities - The growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 and in 2017 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash expenses. In addition, the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 over 2016 was increased in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the Abel Pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably PowerPlan, and to a much lesser extent capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Deltek.Financing activities - Cash provided by/(used in) financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments/borrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $405, partially offset by the net issuance of senior notes of $200 and dividends paid to shareholders. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $660 and the repayment of $400 of senior notes. Cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions.Cash and cash equivalents decreased as a result of the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2018 by $13.8 as compared to an increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $59.2 and a decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $37.5. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to the weakening 24of functional currencies of our Canadian and certain European subsidiaries against the U.S. dollar, while the increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the strengthening of functional currencies of our European subsidiaries against the U.S. dollar. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to the weakening of functional currencies of our European subsidiaries against the U.S. dollar. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was a negative $200 at December 31, 2018 compared to negative $140 at December 31, 2017, due primarily to increased deferred revenue and accrued compensation, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. This deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services.Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018 (39.1% of total capital) compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2017 (43.0% of total capital). Our decreased total debt at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $405, the repayment at maturity of $800 of outstanding 2.05% senior unsecured notes and the redemption of $500 of outstanding 6.25% senior unsecured notes, partially offset by the issuance of $700 of 3.65% senior unsecured notes and $800 of 4.20% senior unsecured notes.On September 23, 2016, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of July 27, 2012, as amended as of October 28, 2015 (the “2012 Facility”). The 2016 Facility comprises a five year $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150 for letters of credit. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500. The 2016 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1.On December 2, 2016, we amended the 2016 Facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.0 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment, 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquisition (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017.At December 31, 2018, we had $4.1 billion of senior unsecured notes and $865 of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $3 of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $79 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2018, of which $37 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of our senior secured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 totaled $339 as compared to $592 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of 42.7%. The decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $472 during the year, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. The Company intends to distribute all historical unremitted earnings up to the amount of foreign cash and cash equivalents, as well as all future foreign earnings that can be repatriated without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. Any remaining outside basis differences relating to the Company’s investments in foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.Capital expenditures of $49.1, $48.8 and $37.3 were incurred during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $9.5, $10.8 and $2.8 were incurred during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditures and capitalized 25software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to our 2016 acquisitions. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesAll currency amounts are in millionsThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2018.

See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.As of December 31, 2018, we had $582.6 of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2019 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.26ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2018, we had $4.1 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.8% to 4.2%. At December 31, 2018, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.1% and 0.7% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $865 of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 17% of our total revenues in 2018 and 68% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2018 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.27",2023-12-30 21:34:34.649063
882835,ROP,ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC,2020,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017 relating to any sections which remain unchanged. OverviewWe are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and SaaS) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses.Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition, income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. These issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $16.9 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.4, for a total of $20.3, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $23.1, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable, at December 31, 2018. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. 17We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2019, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $33.4, or 14.4% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $30.3, or 13.7% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2018. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.Most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Revenues from our project-based businesses, including toll and traffic systems, control systems and installations of large software application projects, are generally recognized over time using the input method, primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs, as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of $247.8, $245.9 and $249.3 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, using this method. There was $401.6 and $241.6 of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The primary driver in the increase was due to our TransCore business that was awarded the contract for the New York Central Business District Tolling Program.Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2019, our effective income tax rate was 20.6%, as compared to the 2018 rate of 21.2%. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of $10.0 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of Gatan's book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the Imaging and Gatan gains. We expect the effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 21% and 23%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.18Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.Roper has 35 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.5 billion. In 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 33 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units. For the remaining two reporting units, the Company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2019. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.The Company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2019. Of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis, one, associated with our lab software business, had a fair value that approximated its carrying value, which was $100.4 as of October 1, 2019. Holding other assumptions constant, for the specific trade name associated with our lab software business, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $5.5 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an $9.7 impairment.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2019.The most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.19Results of OperationsAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are net of revenuesPercentages may not sum due to rounding.The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The increase was the result of organic growth of 2.8% and a net effect from acquisitions and divestitures of 1.4%, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 0.8%.In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $135.3 or 9% over the year ended December 31, 2018. Organic revenues increased by 5% and acquisitions accounted for 5% of our growth, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based revenue growth across the segment, led by businesses serving government contracting, professional services, legal and healthcare markets. Gross margin remained relatively flat at 67.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased to 41.5%, as compared to 42.3% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues. The resulting operating margin was 25.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 24.6% in the year ended December 31, 2018.Our Network Software & Systems segment reported a $184.3 or 14% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 over the year ended December 31, 2018. Organic revenues increased by 5% and acquisitions accounted for 8% of our growth. The growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our network software businesses serving the transportation, healthcare and food markets. Gross margin increased to 69.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 34.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 32.3% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the acquisitions completed in 2019, including amortization of acquired intangibles. The resulting operating margin was 35.2% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 36.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018.Net revenues for our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment decreased by $109.2 or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from the year ended December 31, 2018. Organic revenues increased 2%, more than offset by a decrease in revenue of 8% attributable to the disposal of the Imaging businesses and Gatan as discussed above, and a negative foreign exchange impact of 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to our medical products and water meter technology businesses, partially offset by industrial business declines. Gross margin decreased to 58.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 58.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 27.9% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues and the sale of the Imaging businesses. The resulting operating margin was 31.4% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 30.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018.In our Process Technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $34.8 or 5% from the year ended December 31, 2018. Organic sales decreased by 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. The decrease in organic revenues was due primarily to lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets. Gross margin increased to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 56.4% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 22.3% in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 22.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to lower costs that are generally variable with revenue. As a result, operating margin was 34.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 34.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018.Corporate expenses decreased by $31.1 to $172.4, or 3.2% of revenues, in 2019 as compared to $203.5, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2018. The decrease was due primarily to $35.0 of accelerated vesting associated with the passing of our former executive chairman incurred in 2018, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses.Interest expense, net, increased $4.5, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by lower weighted average debt balances.Loss on debt extinguishment of $15.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, incurred in connection with the early redemption of the $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2019, was composed of the early redemption premium and remaining unamortized deferred financing costs.Other expense, net, of $5.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries, partially offset by royalty income. Other income, net, of $0.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 was composed primarily of royalty income, offset entirely by various other immaterial expenses. 21Gain on disposal of businesses, resulted in a pretax gain of $920.7 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recognized $119.6 on the sale of the Imaging businesses, which closed February 5, 2019, and $801.1 on the sale of Gatan, which closed October 29, 2019.During 2019, our effective income tax rate was 20.6% as compared to our 2018 rate of 21.2%. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of $10.0 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of Gatan's book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the Imaging and Gatan gains.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2019 2018 changeApplication Software$834.6 $756.4 10.3 %Network Software & Systems848.5 501.0 69.4Measurement & Analytical Solutions188.5 305.6 (38.3)Process Technologies113.8 129.8 (12.3)Total$1,985.4 $1,692.8 17.3 %Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $5.19 billion as compared to $4.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 12.7%. The increase was the result of organic growth of 9.4%, a net effect from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.9%, and foreign exchange benefit of 0.4%.In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $230.5 or 19% over the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic revenues increased by 9% and acquisitions accounted for 9%. The growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based revenue growth across the segment, led by businesses serving government contracting, professional services, legal and healthcare markets, and the non-recurrence of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our 2016 Deltek acquisition. Gross margin was 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenues. SG&A expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of revenues at 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 42.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The resulting operating margin was 24.6% in 2018 as compared to 22.8% in 2017.In our Network Software & Systems segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $91.1 or 7% over the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic revenues increased by 6% and acquisitions accounted for 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our network software businesses serving the transportation markets and the non-recurrence of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our 2016 ConstructConnect acquisition. Gross margin increased to 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenues. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 32.3% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 31.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the acquisitions completed in 2018, including amortization of acquired intangibles. The resulting operating margin was 36.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 35.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017.In our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $174.3 or 11% over the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic revenues increased by 11% and the foreign exchange benefit was 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our scientific imaging, water meter technology and medical products businesses. Gross margin increased to 58.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 58.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 27.9% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. The resulting operating margin was 30.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 29.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017.22In our Process Technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $87.8 or 15% from the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic sales increased by 14% and the benefit from foreign exchange was 1%. The growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based growth in our businesses serving energy and industrial end markets. Gross margin increased to 56.4% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 56.3% in the year ended December 31, 2017 and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 22.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 24.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. As a result, operating margin was 34.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 31.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2018 2017 changeApplication Software$756.4 $679.8 11.3 %Network Software & Systems501.0 550.6 (9.0)%Measurement & Analytical Solutions305.6 313.2 (2.4)%Process Technologies129.8 128.8 0.8 %Total$1,692.8 $1,672.4 1.2 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities$1,461.8 $1,430.1 $1,234.5Investing activities(1,296.0) (1,335.1) (209.6)Financing activities177.0 (388.1) (1,170.0)Operating activities - The growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 and in 2018 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash expenses, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2019, most notably cash taxes paid on the gain on sale of the Imaging businesses. Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably iPipeline and Foundry, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the Gatan business and the Imaging businesses. Cash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably PowerPlan. Financing activities - Cash provided by/(used in) financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments/borrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes partially offset by $865.0 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $405.0, partially offset by the net issuance of senior notes of $200.0 and dividends paid to shareholders.Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative $505.4 at December 31, 2019 compared to negative $200.4 at December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased income taxes payable, deferred revenue, and the adoption of ASC 842, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. The increase in income taxes payable is due primarily to the approximately $200.0 of taxes incurred on the gain associated with the divestiture of Gatan. We expect to pay these taxes in the second quarter of 2020. The deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services.Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019 (35.9% of total capital) compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018 (39.1% of total capital). Our increased total debt at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 was due primarily to the issuance of $500.0 of 2.35% senior unsecured notes and $700.0 of 2.95% senior unsecured notes, partially offset by the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $865.0.23On September 23, 2016, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit facility, as amended as of December 2, 2016 (the “2016 Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of July 27, 2012, as amended as of October 28, 2015 (the “2012 Facility”). The 2016 Facility comprises a five year $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0. The 2016 Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1.The 2016 Facility provides that the consolidated total leverage ratio may be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.00 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquisition in December of 2016, we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017.At December 31, 2019, we had $5.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and $0.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $7.7 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $74.0 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2019, of which $35.8 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of our senior secured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 totaled $291.8 as compared to $339.0 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of 13.9%. The decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $290.6 during the year and cash used in the acquisition of Foundry, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax.Capital expenditures of $52.7, $49.1 and $48.8 were incurred during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $10.2, $9.5 and $10.8 were incurred during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.24Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesAll currency amounts are in millionsThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2019.

See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.As of December 31, 2019, we had $732.7 of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2020 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.25ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2019, we had $5.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.35% to 4.20%. At December 31, 2019, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.1% and 1.5% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $0 of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 16% of our total revenues in 2019 and 70% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2019 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.26",2023-12-30 21:34:33.146583

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedA detailed discussion of the fiscal 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of fiscal 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. OverviewWe are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and SaaS) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses.Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition, income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. Estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given after the customer obtains control over the promised products or services, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, changes to customer creditworthiness and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions based on an analysis of historical credit memos and is treated as a reduction in revenue. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $25.3 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.8, for a total of $29.1, or 3.3% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $20.3, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable, at December 31, 2019. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use 20historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2020, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $40.4, or 16.9% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $33.4, or 14.4% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2019. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost is influenced by specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.Most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.Revenues from our project-based businesses, including toll and traffic systems, control systems and installations of large software application projects, are generally recognized over time using the input method, primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs, as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of $345.0, $247.8 and $245.9 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using this method. There was $363.9 and $401.6 of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to revenue recognized at our TransCore business related to the contract for the New York Central Business District Tolling Program during 2020.Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2020, our effective income tax rate was 21.5%, as compared to the 2019 rate of 20.6%. The increase was due primarily to the following non-recurring items in 2019, (i) recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses, and (ii) the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of Gatan's book basis over tax basis in the shares of $10.0 in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the Imaging and Gatan gains during 2019. We expect the effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21% to 22%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates, future operating margins, discount rates, terminal values and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.21Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.Roper has 36 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $3,228.7. In 2020, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 35 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units. For the remaining reporting unit, the Company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2020. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates, projected revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal values. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.The Company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of October 1, 2020. Of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis, one, associated with our lab software business, had a fair value approximately 20% in excess of its carrying value, as compared to 2019 when the fair value approximated its carrying value. The primary driver of the increase in the fair value from 2019 to 2020 was a decrease in the discount rate, primarily due to a reduced risk-free interest rate. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $2.8 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in a fair value that approximates its carrying value.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2020.The most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates, projected customer revenue growth rates, margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.22Results of OperationsAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are net of revenuesPercentages may not sum due to rounding.The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The increase was the result of net acquisition/divestiture contribution of 3.9% and a foreign exchange benefit of 0.1%, partially offset by an organic decline of 1.0%.In our Application Software segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $211.9 or 13% over the year ended December 31, 2019. Organic revenues increased by 1% and acquisitions accounted for 13% of our growth. The growth in organic revenues was primarily due to businesses serving healthcare and government contracting markets. Gross margin increased to 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 67.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues and revenue mix. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 42.2%, as compared to 41.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2020. The resulting operating margin was 26.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 25.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019.Our Network Software & Systems segment reported a $209.1 or 14% increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the year ended December 31, 2019. Organic revenues increased by 4% and acquisitions accounted for 10% of our growth. The growth in organic revenues was led by our higher project activity at our toll and traffic business and subscription growth at our SaaS businesses. Gross margin decreased to 67.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 69.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 35.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 34.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2019. The resulting operating margin was 31.6% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 35.2% in the year ended December 31, 2019.Net revenues for our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment decreased by $126.5 or 8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Organic revenues increased 1%, more than offset by a decrease in revenue of 9% attributable to the disposal of Gatan and the Imaging businesses. The growth in organic revenues was due to accelerated adoption of Verathon’s video-assisted intubation products that aid in reducing COVID transmission to healthcare workers, partially offset by declines in our water meter technology business, due to restricted access to indoor meters located in the Northeast United States and Canada, and industrial business declines. Gross margin increased to 59.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 58.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat at 27.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The resulting operating margin was 32.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 31.4% in the year ended December 31, 2019.In our Process Technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $134.2 or 21% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, all of which was organic. The decrease in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue declines across the segment led by lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets resulting from lower energy prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin decreased to 53.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to lower revenues. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 28.1% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 22.3% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to $13.6 of restructuring charges for structural cost reduction actions taken at certain of our businesses and lower operating leverage on organic revenue declines. As a result, operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 34.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019.Corporate expenses increased by $20.1 to $192.5, or 3.5% of revenues, in 2020 as compared to $172.4, or 3.2% of revenues, in 2019. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock compensation expense and professional services.Interest expense, net, increased $32.3, or 17.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to (i) higher weighted average debt balances, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates, and (ii) $7.2 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the Vertafore acquisition.Other expense, net, of $2.9 and $5.1 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries, partially offset by royalty income. 24Gain on disposal of businesses, resulted in a pretax gain of $920.7 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recognized $119.6 on the sale of the Imaging businesses, which closed February 5, 2019, and $801.1 on the sale of Gatan, which closed October 29, 2019.During 2020, our effective income tax rate was 21.5% as compared to our 2019 rate of 20.6%. The increase was due primarily to the following non-recurring items in 2019, (i) recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses, and (ii) the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of Gatan's book basis over tax basis in the shares of $10.0 in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the Imaging and Gatan gains during 2019.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 27% to $2,516.1 at December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,985.4 at December 31, 2019, organic growth was 3% and acquisitions contributed 24%. 20202019changeApplication Software$1,366.9 $834.6 63.8 %Network Software & Systems802.9 848.5 (5.4)Measurement & Analytical Solutions228.8 188.5 21.4 Process Technologies117.5 113.8 3.3 Total$2,516.1 $1,985.4 26.7 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 are as follows: 20202019Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities$1,525.1 $1,461.8 Investing activities(6,073.9)(1,296.0)Financing activities4,136.9 177.0 Operating activities - The growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and in 2019 was primarily due to improvement in working capital, lower cash taxes paid excluding the tax associated with gain on disposal of businesses, and $43.7 of employer social security payroll taxes deferred during the year ended December 31, 2020, that are payable in installments in 2021 and 2022 under the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid of $201.9 on the disposal of Gatan paid in 2020 as compared to $39.4 of cash taxes paid on the disposal of the Imaging businesses in 2019.Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Vertafore and EPSI. Cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably iPipeline and Foundry, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the Gatan business and the Imaging businesses.Financing activities - Cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of $3,300.0 of senior notes and $1,620.0 of net borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by $600.0 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments. Cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of $1,200.0 of senior notes partially offset by $865.0 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments.Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative $498.4 at December 31, 2020 compared to negative $505.4 at December 31, 2019, due primarily to lower income taxes payable and increased accounts receivable, partially offset by increased deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities. The decrease in income taxes payable is due primarily to the $201.9 income tax cash payment associated with the divestiture of Gatan. The deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services. Consistent negative net working capital demonstrates Roper’s continued evolution and focus on asset-light business models.25Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $9,626.2 at December 31, 2020 (47.9% of total capital) compared to $5,307.7 at December 31, 2019 (35.9% of total capital). Our increased total debt at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was due primarily to the issuance of $3,300.0 senior unsecured notes and $1,620.0 of revolving debt borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of $600.0 of outstanding 3.00% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used primarily to fund the purchase price of the acquisition of Vertafore.On September 2, 2020, the Company entered into a new three-year unsecured credit facility among Roper, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agents, and MUFG Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., PNC Bank, National Association, Truist Bank and TD Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agents, which replaced its existing $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility, dated as of September 23, 2016, as amended. The new facility comprises a three-year $3,000.0 revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. Loans under the facility will be available in dollars, and letters of credit will be available in dollars and other currencies to be agreed. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0.The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Total Debt to Total Capital Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Roper’s option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty.We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.At December 31, 2020, we had $8,000.0 of senior unsecured notes and $1,620.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $6.2 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $67.1 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020, of which $29.0 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 totaled $259.1 as compared to $291.8 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of 11.2%. The decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $373.4 during the year, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings.Capital expenditures of $31.2, $52.7 and $49.1 were incurred during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $17.7, $10.2 and $9.5 were incurred during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.26Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesAll currency amounts are in millionsThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2020.

See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.As of December 31, 2020, we had $716.9 of outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. Although we maintain an active acquisition program we are committed to reducing debt. Future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines, future cash flows from operations, future divestitures, the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods, the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally.We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2021 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions, the financial performance of our existing companies and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business prospects and the financial markets generally. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.27ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2020, we had $8,000.0 of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 0.45% to 4.20%. At December 31, 2020, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 3.2% lower and 0.1% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $3,000.0 variable-rate revolver with $1,620.0 of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 16% of our total revenues in 2020 and 74% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2020 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.28",2023-12-30 21:34:23.064953

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedOverviewWe are a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and SaaS) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses that offer high value-added software, services, engineered products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets. Discontinued OperationsDuring 2021, Roper signed definitive agreements to divest its TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Roper has completed the divestitures of Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, in the first quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively, and expects the TransCore transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The financial results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Information regarding discontinued operations is included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of revenue recognition, income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. Estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to have a material financial impact from period-to-period. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. If there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the 19tax law changes are unfavorable, then we could be required to recognize valuation allowances against deferred tax balances, resulting in an increase to income tax expense and the effective tax rate. During 2021, our effective income tax rate was 22.7%, as compared to the 2020 rate of 21.5%. The increase was due primarily to a non-recurring item related to a UK tax rate change, which had a $21.7 unfavorable impact in 2021. We expect the effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 21% to 22%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes an equal weighted income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates, future operating margins, discount rates, terminal values and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.Roper has 34 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $3,245.3. In 2021, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in any of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units as of October 1, 2021. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates, projected revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal values. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of 20impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined the use of the Sunquest trade name would be discontinued given the strategic action to merge the Sunquest business into our CliniSys business, both of which are reported in our Application Software reportable segment. Considering the planned merger and updated market comparisons, the royalty rate utilized in the quantitative impairment assessment of the trade name was 0.5% as compared to a royalty rate of 3.5% used in the prior year. The royalty rate reduction was the significant assumption that resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $94.4 recognized as a component of “Impairment of intangible assets” within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.The most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates, projected customer revenue growth rates, margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.During the fourth quarter of 2021, Sunquest also recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $5.1 representing the unamortized balance related primarily to a software intangible asset that will be discontinued in 2022. This impairment charge is included as a component of “Impairment of intangible assets” within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.21Results of OperationsAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are net of revenuesPercentages may not sum due to rounding.The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The growth of 8.2% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the government contracting, healthcare and legal markets. Gross margin increased to 69.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquisition of Vertafore and operating leverage on higher organic revenues. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 42.6%, as compared to 42.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the Vertafore and EPSi acquisitions, partially offset by operating leverage on higher organic revenues. The resulting operating margin was 26.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 26.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020.In our Network Software & Systems segment, net revenues were $1,338.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1,173.7 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth of 11.2% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our network software businesses serving the spot freight, post-acute care and construction markets. Gross margin increased to 82.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 81.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 43.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 46.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic sales. The resulting operating margin was 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 35.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020.In our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment, net revenues were $1,559.6 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1,425.6 the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth of 8.2% in organic revenues was broad-based led by our industrial, water meter technology, and medical products businesses excluding Verathon, which declined due to unprecedented demand for their products used in the treatment of COVID-19 during 2020. Gross margin decreased to 57.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 59.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to revenue mix, reduced operating leverage associated with Verathon’s normalized 2021 revenues and costs associated with navigating the widespread supply chain challenges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 26.8% in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to revenue mix. The resulting operating margin was 30.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 32.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020.In our Process Technologies segment, net revenues were $499.2 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $455.0 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth of 8.3% in organic revenues was due to broad-based across the segment as energy and industrial markets continue to recover from the reduction in demand caused by the pandemic. Gross margin increased to 54.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 53.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to increased operating leverage on higher organic revenues partially offset by costs associated with navigating the widespread supply chain challenges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 23.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 28.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to $13.6 of restructuring charges for structural cost reduction actions taken at certain of our businesses during the second quarter of 2020 and operating leverage on higher organic revenues. As a result, operating margin was 30.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020.Corporate expenses increased by $15.6 to $203.3, or 3.5% of revenues, in 2021 as compared to $187.7, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2020. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher compensation related expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition related expenses.23Impairment of intangible assets was $99.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to the strategic action to merge the Sunquest business into our CliniSys business resulting in impairment of a trade name and other amortizable intangible assets. Interest expense, net, increased $15.6, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher weighted average debt balances, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates and $7.2 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the Vertafore acquisition in 2020.Other income, net, of $24.9 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was composed primarily of a gain on sale of minority investment of $27.1. Other expense, net of $3.6 for the year ended December 31, 2020, was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. During 2021, our effective income tax rate was 22.7% as compared to our 2020 rate of 21.5%. The increase was due primarily to a non-recurring item related to a UK tax rate change, which had a $21.7 unfavorable impact in 2021.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 24.2% to $2,560.8 at December 31, 2021 as compared to $2,061.8 at December 31, 2020, with the increase driven primarily by organic growth. 20212020ChangeApplication Software$1,541.9 $1,366.9 12.8 %Network Software & Systems468.1 363.5 28.8 Measurement & Analytical Solutions400.6 224.0 78.8 Process Technologies150.2 107.4 39.9 Total$2,560.8 $2,061.8 24.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $4,854.2 as compared to $4,727.7 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2.7%.

The growth of 0.6% in organic revenues was primarily due to businesses serving healthcare and government contracting markets. Gross margin increased to 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 67.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues and revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 42.2%, as compared to 41.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2020. The resulting operating margin was 26.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 25.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019.24In our Network Software & Systems segment, net revenues were $1,173.7 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,004.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The growth of 1.6% in organic revenues was due to subscription growth at our SaaS businesses led by our business serving the spot freight market in the United States. Gross margin decreased to 81.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 83.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 46.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 44.2% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2019. The resulting operating margin was 35.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 38.7% in the year ended December 31, 2019.In our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment, net revenues were $1,425.6 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,544.3 the year ended December 31, 2019. The growth of 2.0% in organic revenues was due to accelerated adoption of Verathon’s video-assisted intubation products that aid in reducing COVID transmission to healthcare workers, partially offset by declines in our water meter technology business, due to restricted access to indoor meters located in the Northeast United States and Canada, and industrial business declines. Gross margin increased to 59.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 58.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at 26.8% in both the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The resulting operating margin was 32.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 31.8% in the year ended December 31, 2019.In our Process Technologies segment, net revenues were $455.0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $591.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of 23.1% in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue declines across the segment led by lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets resulting from lower energy prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin decreased to 53.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 57.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to lower revenues. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 28.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 21.3% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to $13.6 of restructuring charges for structural cost reduction actions taken at certain of our businesses and lower operating leverage on organic revenue declines. As a result, operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 35.8% in the year ended December 31, 2019.Corporate expenses increased by $18.7 to $187.7, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2020 as compared to $169.0, or 3.6% of revenues, in 2019. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock compensation expense and professional services. Interest expense, net, increased $32.3, or 17.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to (i) higher weighted average debt balances, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates, and (ii) $7.2 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the Vertafore acquisition in 2020.Other expense, net, of $3.6 and $5.4 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. Gain on disposal of businesses, resulted in a pretax gain of $920.7 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recognized $119.6 on the sale of the Imaging businesses, which closed February 5, 2019, and $801.1 on the sale of Gatan, which closed October 29, 2019.During 2020, our effective income tax rate was 21.5% as compared to our 2019 rate of 20.3%. The increase was due primarily to the following non-recurring items in 2019, (i) recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses, and (ii) the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of Gatan's book basis over tax basis in the shares of $10.0 in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the Imaging and Gatan gains during 2019.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 40.3% to $2,061.8 at December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,469.7 at December 31, 2019, acquisitions contributed approximately 33% and organic growth was 7%.25 20202019ChangeApplication Software$1,366.9 $834.6 63.8 %Network Software & Systems363.5 346.7 4.8 %Measurement & Analytical Solutions224.0 184.9 21.1 %Process Technologies107.4 103.5 3.8 %Total$2,061.8 $1,469.7 40.3 %Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows.

These increases were partially offset by lower cash provided by working capital as compared to the prior year.Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities during 2021 was primarily for business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from the sale of CIVCO Radiotherapy. Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Vertafore and EPSi.Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to net repayments of $1,150.0 on our unsecured credit facility, $500.0 of repayments for our senior notes and dividend payments. Cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of $3,300.0 of senior notes and $1,620.0 of net borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by $600.0 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments. Net working capital (total current assets, excluding cash and current assets held for sale, less total current liabilities, excluding debt and current liabilities held for sale) was negative $882.5 at December 31, 2021 compared to negative $704.4 at December 31, 2020, due primarily to increased balances of deferred revenue and income taxes payable partially offset by increased accounts receivable. Consistent negative net working capital demonstrates Roper’s focus on asset-light business models. Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $7,970.3 at December 31, 2021 (40.8% of total capital) compared to $9,620.5 at December 31, 2020 (47.9% of total capital). Our total debt decreased at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, due primarily to $1,150.0 of revolving debt repayments and the redemption of $500.0 of outstanding 2.80% senior unsecured notes.On September 2, 2020, the Company entered into a three-year unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agents, and MUFG Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., PNC Bank, National Association, Truist Bank and TD Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agents, which replaced its previous $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility, dated as of September 23, 2016, as amended. The facility comprises a three-year $3,000.0 revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0.The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Total Debt to Total Capital Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Roper’s option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty.26We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.At December 31, 2021, we had $7,500.0 of senior unsecured notes and $470.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. We had $84.9 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2021, of which $28.2 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2021 totaled $310.8 as compared to $259.1 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 20.0%. The increase was due primarily due to cash generated from foreign operations, partially offset by the repatriation of $329.3 during the year. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings.Capital expenditures of $32.9, $28.3 and $43.0 were incurred during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $29.7, $17.7 and $10.2 were incurred during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2019. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesAll currency amounts are in millionsThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2021.

Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines, future cash flows from operations, future divestitures, the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods, the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally.27We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2022 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions, the financial performance of our existing companies and the financial markets generally. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.28ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2021, we had $7,500.0 of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 0.45% to 4.20%. At December 31, 2021, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 2.6% lower and 0.7% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $3,000.0 variable-rate revolver with $470.0 of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 17% of our total revenues in 2021 and 77% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a European functional currency. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2021 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.29",2023-12-30 21:34:22.183217

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedOverviewRoper Technologies is a diversified technology company. Roper has a proven, long-term, successful track record of compounding cash flow and shareholder value. We operate market leading businesses that design and develop vertical software and technology enabled products for a variety of defensible niche markets.We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow by enabling continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other businesses that offer high value-added software, services, technology-enabled products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. Discontinued OperationsOn November 22, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of a majority 51% equity stake in its industrial businesses, including its entire historical Process Technologies reportable segment and the industrial businesses within its historical Measurement & Analytical Solutions reportable segment, to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC. The businesses included in this transaction were Alpha, AMOT, CCC, Cornell, Dynisco, FTI, Hansen, Hardy, Logitech, Metrix, PAC, Roper Pump, Struers, Technolog, Uson, and Viatran (collectively “Indicor”). Following the sale of the majority stake, the Company retained an initial 49% minority equity interest in the new standalone parent company, Indicor, LLC. This transaction is referred to herein as the “Indicor Transaction.”During 2021, Roper entered into definitive agreements to divest our TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses (“2021 Divestitures”). As of March 31, 2022, Roper had completed the 2021 Divestitures. The aggregate of the 2021 Divestitures and the Indicor Transaction have greatly reduced the cyclicality and asset intensity of the Company. In addition, the Company has an increased mix of recurring revenue and a higher margin profile. The financial results for Indicor and the 2021 Divestitures are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relate to continuing operations. Information regarding discontinued operations is included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Update to Segment Reporting StructureDuring the second quarter of 2022, we updated our reportable segment structure following the announcement of the Indicor Transaction. The Company’s new reporting segment structure is classified based on business model and delivery of performance obligations. The three updated reportable segments (and businesses within each; including changes due to acquisitions since the realignment) are as follows:–Application Software - Aderant, CBORD/Horizon, CliniSys, Data Innovations, Deltek, Frontline Education, IntelliTrans, PowerPlan, Strata, Vertafore–Network Software - ConstructConnect, DAT, Foundry, iPipeline, iTradeNetwork, Loadlink, MHA, SHP, SoftWriters–Technology Enabled Products - CIVCO Medical Solutions, FMI, Inovonics, IPA, Neptune, Northern Digital, rf IDEAS, VerathonFollowing the Indicor Transaction and the realignment of our reportable segments, the day-to-day operations of our businesses, our organizational structure, and our strategy remain unchanged. All prior periods have been recast to reflect the changes noted above. Financial information about our reportable segments is presented in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.20Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report.GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses, and valuation of our initial 49% equity interest in Indicor. Estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to have a material financial impact from period-to-period. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. If there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax law changes are unfavorable there could be a resulting increase to income tax expense and the effective tax rate. During 2022, our effective income tax rate was 23.1%, as compared to the 2021 rate of 22.0%. The rate was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a net tax expense associated with an internal restructuring plan associated with the Indicor Transaction. We expect the effective tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 21% to 22%.We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes an equal weighted income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no 21further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.Key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates, future operating margins, discount rates, terminal values and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.As of the annual impairment test, the Company has 21 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from $17.5 to $3,363.1. In 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in any of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units as of October 1, 2022. Trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates, projected revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal values. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined the use of the Sunquest trade name would be discontinued given the strategic action to merge the Sunquest business into our CliniSys business, both of which are reported in our Application Software reportable segment. Considering the planned merger and updated market comparisons, the royalty rate utilized in the quantitative impairment assessment of the trade name was 0.5% as compared to a royalty rate of 3.5% used in the prior year. The royalty rate reduction was the significant assumption that resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $94.4 recognized as a component of “Impairment of intangible assets” within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.The most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates, projected customer revenue growth rates, margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.22We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.The Company has an initial 49% minority equity interest in Indicor which provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We elected to apply the fair value option as we believe this is the most reasonable method to value the equity investment. This investment is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as valuation of the investment at future dates will reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Any changes to the valuation estimates or assumptions as described further in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements could produce significantly different results.23Results of OperationsAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are net of revenuesPercentages may not sum due to rounding.The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated.

The growth of 7.5% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the property and casualty insurance, acute healthcare, and government contracting markets. Gross margin decreased to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 69.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to increased headcount to support growth, and a higher mix of SaaS and professional service revenue across a number of businesses. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 41.8%, as compared to 42.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to improved operating leverage on higher organic revenues partially offset by higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisition of Frontline Education. The resulting operating margin was 27.1% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 26.8% in the year ended December 31, 2021.In our Network Software segment, net revenues were $1,378.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $1,223.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The growth of 12.7% in organic revenues was led by our network software businesses serving the freight match, life insurance, and media and entertainment markets. Gross margin increased to 84.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 84.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to favorable revenue mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 43.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 45.1% in the year ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic sales. The resulting operating margin was 41.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 39.0% in the year ended December 31, 2021.In our Technology Enabled Products segment, net revenues were $1,353.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $1,243.3 the year ended December 31, 2021. The growth of 9.8% in organic revenues was primarily due to our water meter technology business and medical products businesses. Gross margin decreased to 56.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 59.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to higher material, component and freight costs as our businesses navigate the widespread global supply chain challenges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 25.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to improved operating leverage on higher organic sales. The resulting operating margin was 33.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 33.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021.Corporate expenses increased by $19.3 to $209.2, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2022 as compared to $189.9, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2021. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher professional service and acquisition related expenses partially offset by lower compensation expense.Impairment of intangible assets was $94.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to the strategic action to merge the Sunquest business into our CliniSys business resulting in impairment of the Sunquest trade name. Interest expense, net, decreased $41.5, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to lower weighted average debt balances and higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.Other expense, net, of $50.1 for the year ended December 31, 2022 was composed primarily of a legal settlement expense of $45.0 related to the Berall v. Verathon patent litigation matter. Other income, net of $24.6 for the year ended December 31, 2021, was composed primarily of a gain on sale of minority investment of $27.1. 25During 2022, our effective income tax rate was 23.1% as compared to our 2021 rate of 22.0%. The rate was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a net tax expense associated with an internal restructuring plan related to the Indicor Transaction.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 25.3% to $2,912.6 at December 31, 2022 as compared to $2,325.1 at December 31, 2021.

Gross margin increased to 69.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 68.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquisition of Vertafore and operating leverage on higher organic revenues. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 42.7%, as compared to 42.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the Vertafore and EPSi acquisitions, partially offset by operating leverage on higher organic revenues. The resulting operating margin was 26.8% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 26.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020.In our Network Software segment, net revenues were $1,223.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1,069.4 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based led by our water meter technology, and medical products businesses excluding Verathon, which declined due to unprecedented demand for their products used in the treatment of COVID-19 during 2020. Gross margin decreased to 59.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 61.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to reduced operating leverage associated with Verathon’s normalized 2021 revenues and costs associated with navigating the widespread supply chain challenges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 25.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 26.2% in 26the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to revenue mix. The resulting operating margin was 33.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 35.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020.Corporate expenses increased by $10.1 to $189.9, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2021 as compared to $179.8, or 4.5% of revenues, in 2020. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher compensation related expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition related expenses.Interest expense, net, increased $15.4, or 7.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher weighted average debt balances, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates and $7.2 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the Vertafore acquisition in 2020.Other income, net, of $24.6 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was composed primarily of a gain on sale of minority investment of $27.1. Other expense, net of $3.1 for the year ended December 31, 2020, was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. During 2021, our effective income tax rate was 22.0% as compared to our 2020 rate of 21.8%. The increase was due primarily to a non-recurring item related to a UK tax rate change, which had a $20.4 unfavorable impact in 2021.Order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 22.0% to $2,325.1 at December 31, 2021 as compared to $1,905.5 at December 31, 2020, with the increase driven primarily by organic growth. 20212020ChangeApplication Software$1,541.9 $1,366.9 12.8 %Network Software448.3 361.4 24.0 Technology Enabled Products334.9 177.2 89.0 Total$2,325.1 $1,905.5 22.0 %Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAll currency amounts are in millions unless specifiedSelected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows. 202220212020Cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations from:Operating activities$606.6 $1,655.8 $1,123.2 Investing activities(4,351.8)(249.2)(6,067.6)Financing activities(1,453.9)(1,807.1)4,138.7 Cash provided by discontinued operations5,677.9 456.0 393.8 Operating activities - The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2022 as compared to 2021 was due primarily to (i) the non-recurrence of $953.8 of cash taxes paid in connection with the 2021 Divestitures and the Indicor Transaction, (ii) $97.8 of higher cash taxes associated with changes to Internal Revenue Code Section 174 and (iii) less cash provided by working capital. These cash outflows were partially offset by higher net income from continuing operations net of non-cash expenses.The increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2021 as compared to 2020 was due primarily to higher net income net of non-cash expenses and the non-recurrence of $201.9 of cash taxes paid on the disposal of Gatan in 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower cash provided by working capital as compared to 2020.Investing activities - Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during 2022 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Frontline Education, viDesktop and MGA Systems. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during 2021 was primarily for business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a minority investment. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Vertafore and EPSi.27Financing activities - Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during 2022 was primarily due to repayments of $800.0 for our senior notes, net repayments of $470.0 on our unsecured credit facility and dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during 2021 was primarily due to net repayments of $1,150.0 on our unsecured credit facility, $500.0 of repayments for our senior notes and dividend payments. Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of $3,300.0 of senior notes and $1,620.0 of net borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by $600.0 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments.Discontinued operations - Cash provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of the majority stake in Indicor, TransCore and Zetec, slightly offset by less cash provided by operating cash flows from discontinued operations which was impacted by the timing of our divestiture activity. Cash provided by discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the sale of CIVCO Radiotherapy. Cash provided by discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities.Net working capital (total current assets, excluding cash and current assets held for sale, less total current liabilities, excluding debt and current liabilities held for sale) was negative $1,053.7 at December 31, 2022 compared to negative $990.9 at December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased deferred revenue, partially offset by movements in income tax-related balances and greater inventory build associated with mitigating supply chain challenges. Consistent negative net working capital demonstrates Roper’s focus on asset-light business models. Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $6,700.3 at December 31, 2022 (29.5% of total capital) compared to $7,970.3 at December 31, 2021 (40.8% of total capital). Our total debt decreased at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, due primarily to repayments of $800.0 for our senior notes and net repayments of $470.0 on our unsecured credit facility.On July 21, 2022, the Company entered into a new five-year unsecured credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) among Roper, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as syndication agents, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd., MUFG Bank, Ltd., PNC Bank, National Association, TD Bank, N.A., Truist Bank and U.S Bank, National Association, as documentation agents, which replaced the existing $3,000.0 unsecured credit facility, dated as of September 2, 2020, as amended. The new facility comprises a five-year $3,500.0 revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. Loans under the facility will be available in dollars, and letters of credit will be available in dollars and other currencies to be agreed. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0.The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Total Debt to Total Capital Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Roper’s option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty.We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.At December 31, 2022, we had $6,700.0 of senior unsecured notes and no outstanding revolver borrowings. We had $19.0 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2022, of which $18.3 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.We may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities.See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 totaled $234.0 as compared to $310.8 at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 24.7%. The decrease was due primarily due to repatriation of $285.6 and cash divested in connection with the Indicor Transaction partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings.28Capital expenditures of $40.1, $28.5 and $24.7 were incurred during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capitalized software expenditures of $30.2, $29.7 and $17.7 were incurred during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 2020. In the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and ContingenciesAll currency amounts are in millionsThe following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2022.

Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines, future cash flows from operations, future divestitures, the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods, the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally.We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2023 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions, the financial performance of our existing companies and the financial markets generally. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.29ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.At December 31, 2022, we had $6,700.0 of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 1.00% to 4.20%. At December 31, 2022, the prevailing market rates for each of our long-term notes was at least 0.7% but no more than 4.1% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. Our credit facility contains a $3,500.0 variable-rate revolver with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022.Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars or British pounds. Net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 11% of our total revenues in 2022 and 89% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a functional currency that was either the euro, Canadian dollar or British pound. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2022 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%.The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. In addition, the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. The quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.30",2023-12-30 21:34:29.215395

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Roper’s Consolidated Financial Statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Results of Operations General The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Amounts are dollars in thousands and percentages are of net sales.

(2) Operating profit excludes unallocated corporate administrative costs. Such costs were $6,373, $7,117 and $5,908 for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. (3) Includes results of Abel Pump from May 2000 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (4) Includes results of Photometrics from April 1998, the fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisitions from June 1999, MASD from November 1999, Antek Instruments from August 2000 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. 13 Year Ended October 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1999 Net sales for fiscal 2000 of $503.8 million, a 24% increase compared to the prior year, was the eighth consecutive year Roper established a record high. Excluding net sales to RAO Gazprom (“Gazprom”), a large Russian natural gas company, net sales increased 26% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999. Net sales for fiscal 2000 were 1% less than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999 (assuming fiscal 2000 acquisitions occurred at the same time in fiscal 1999). Net sales for Roper’s Analytical Instrumentation segment increased 50%, mostly the result of business acquisitions (Petroleum Analyzer, MASD, Antek Instruments and other smaller businesses). This segment’s net sales were 2% less than the prior year’s pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid properties test equipment markets. Net sales for Roper’s Fluid Handling segment increased 23%, mostly the result of business acquisitions (Flowdata, Cybor and Abel Pump) and a very strong fiscal 2000 for this segment’s semiconductor-related business. This segment’s net sales were 6% higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999. Fluid Handling’s historical semiconductor business increased its net sales in fiscal 2000 by 81% (partly from favorable comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of fiscal 1999) and its recently-acquired business increased its net sales by 51% compared to the same period in the prior year. Fiscal 2000 net sales for this segment’s centrifugal pump business decreased 19% compared to the prior year due to weak agricultural and water/wastewater markets. Agricultural markets were adversely impacted by widespread drought conditions and low commodity prices in the United States. Roper believes the municipal water and wastewater markets were adversely affected by resources diverted to minimize Y2K exposures early in the fiscal year, and its centrifugal pump business had increased exposure to these markets as it developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative projects. Fluid Handling’s piston metering pumps business’ net sales were also down 15% compared to fiscal 1999 as this company’s largest customer reduced its purchases until it resolves an FDA compliance problem unrelated to this company’s products. This company does not expect shipments to this customer to return to previous levels in the near future. Net sales for Roper’s Industrial Controls segment decreased less than 1% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 net sales were 3% less than pro forma fiscal 1999 net sales. The timing of this segment’s primary fiscal 2000 acquisition (Hansen Technologies) was such that it did not significantly affect fiscal 2000 results. This segment was significantly influenced by conditions in the exploration and production sectors of the oil & gas industry. Roper believes several large oil & gas business combinations early in the year delayed capital spending programs, and spending had yet to recover from the effects of relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of fiscal 1999. Throughout fiscal 2000, net sales each quarter (excluding sales to Gazprom) improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal 1999. Whereas these first quarter net sales were down 22% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter net sales (also excluding Hansen Technologies) were up 13%. Net sales to Gazprom of $33.9 million in fiscal 2000 were comparable to fiscal 1999 net sales of $35.0 million. 14 The gross profit percentage for the Analytical Instrumentation segment decreased to 54.4% in fiscal 2000 compared to 56.3% in fiscal 1999. This decrease arose mostly from the inclusion of MASD for most of fiscal 2000. If MASD’s results were excluded from the segment’s results in fiscal 2000, the segment’s gross profit percentage was 55.9%. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 are presented in the following table. 2000 1999 Total Excl.goodwillamort. Total Excl.goodwillamort Analytical Instrumentation 38 % 34 % 38 % 34 % Fluid Handling 24 22 21 19 Industrial Controls 31 30 31 29 Corporate 1 1 2 2 Total 34 % 31 % 33 % 30 % SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for Roper as a whole because of the increased costs in the Fluid Handling segment and the increased size of the Analytical Instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of SG&A expenses compared to Roper’s other business segments. SG&A expenses for the Fluid Handling segment increased as a percentage of net sales mostly due to relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions, particularly Abel Pump and Flowdata. Roper expects to bring these cost structures more in line with the segment’s other businesses. Another significant reason for this segment’s increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was the adverse leverage associated with the decline in the segment’s centrifugal pump business combined with the added costs of this business moving into a larger facility early in fiscal 2000. Interest expense was $13.5 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $7.3 million in fiscal 1999. Interest expense was higher in fiscal 2000 due primarily to the borrowings associated with the numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal 1999 and especially during fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of approximately $200 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with cash provided by Roper’s then-existing credit facilities. The provision for income taxes was 35.1% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to 34.5% in fiscal 1999. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to several of the recent acquisitions located in relatively high income tax rate jurisdictions and the amortization of some of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired (“goodwill”) which was not deductible for income tax purposes. Roper’s other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2000 were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in Euros, British pounds or Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal 2000, but especially against the Euro and particularly during Roper’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000, Roper’s consolidated net assets decreased $6.7 million ($4.1 million in the fourth quarter) due to foreign currency translation adjustments. Roper’s goodwill denominated in non-U.S. currencies also decreased by $6.7 million due to currency translation adjustments. Therefore, the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments during fiscal 2000 on Roper’s future cash flows is expected to be immaterial to Roper’s future cash flows. 15 The following table summarizes Roper’s net sales orders and sales order backlog information (in thousands). The pro forma amounts include comparable time periods for those companies acquired during fiscal 2000. Net sales ordersYear ended October 31, Sales order backlogOctober 31, 2000 1999 2000 1999 Actual Pro forma Actual Actual Pro forma Actual Analytical Instrumentation $239,903 $228,000 $148,478 $ 54,550 $41,693 $30,000 Fluid Handling 128,925 117,125 100,600 26,073 19,103 14,375 Industrial Controls 160,136 157,596 150,604 29,246 30,405 29,286 $528,964 $502,721 $399,682 $109,869 $91,201 $73,661 The increase in Analytical Instrumentation’s net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an 8% increase in the segment’s digital imaging businesses and a 20% increase in its spectroscopy business (which was influenced by the strong semiconductor industry). The increase in Fluid Handling’s net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in the segment’s semiconductor-related businesses, whose net sales orders increased 68%. Year Ended October 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1998 Net sales for fiscal 1999 of $407.3 million represented the seventh consecutive year that Roper established a record high. Net sales, excluding sales to Gazprom, increased 7% for the year ended October 31, 1999 compared to the year ended October 31, 1998. Total Industrial Controls net sales decreased 10% due mostly to difficult market conditions throughout the oil & gas industry as oil and natural gas prices were at historical lows in the early part of fiscal 1999, and consolidation within the industry. Each of these factors caused reductions in capital spending by Roper’s customers during fiscal 1999. Net sales to Gazprom were $35.0 million for the year ended October 31, 1999, down 16% from fiscal 1998, as a result of dropping certain low margin, pass-through products from the contract. Total Analytical Instrumentation net sales increased 32% due to full-year contributions from the fiscal 1998 acquisitions of Acton Research (February 1998) and Photometrics (March 1998), the partial-year contribution from the fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisitions (June 1999) and improved market conditions for the segment’s digital imaging business. On a pro forma basis, Analytical Instrumentation net sales increased 11% in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. Total Fluid Handling net sales decreased 1% in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. Poor semiconductor equipment industry conditions that affected the Fluid Handling segment primarily in the first half of fiscal 1999 offset the strength in the segment’s centrifugal pump business as several new product offerings were very well received by the market. 16 Industrial Controls’ gross profit percentage increased 1.7 points in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. The major reason for the increase was the elimination of certain low-margin business with Gazprom in fiscal 1999. Analytical Instrumentation’s gross profit also increased 1.7 points in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. The major contributors to this increase were a $1.9 million inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the realization of cost structure improvements at those businesses acquired over the past two years and volume leverage. Fluid Handling’s gross profit increased 3.1 points in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. This gain resulted from a number of factors, including improved product mix in fiscal 1999 from larger diameter centrifugal pumps, an improved power generation market, the leverage of improved semiconductor industry conditions in the second half of fiscal 1999, and improved cost structures throughout the segment. Every one of this segment’s businesses improved gross margins in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. In addition, the improved consolidated gross profit percentage of 2.6 points in fiscal 1999 was due mostly to increased higher-margin Analytical Instrumentation sales. SG&A expenses increased 6% in fiscal 1999 compared to the year ended October 31, 1998 mostly due to the partial year costs associated with Petroleum Analyzer. As a percentage of sales, these costs were 33% in fiscal 1999 compared to 32% in fiscal 1998. This increase was attributed mostly to the increased size of the Analytical Instrumentation segment, whose businesses typically have higher engineering and amortization costs compared to Roper’s other business segments. Analytical Instrumentation’s SG&A costs were 38% and 40% of sales in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively. Comparative percentages for the Industrial Controls and Fluid Handling segments were each within 1 point for these years. Excluding $3.8 million of Russian-related reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 in the Industrial Controls segment, this segment’s SG&A costs were about the same in fiscal 1999 as in fiscal 1998. Interest expense was 8% lower during the year ended October 31, 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, with lower interest rates throughout most of fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998. The German revolving credit facility opened in June 1999 also accrued interest at a relatively low rate compared to U.S. borrowings. Average debt levels were about 4% higher in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. The effective income tax rate was 34.5% for the year ended October 31, 1999 and 34.1% for the year ended October 31, 1998. The differences between the statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for these years were not considered significant. Average outstanding shares were less in fiscal 1999 than fiscal 1998 as a result of the repurchase of 1.2 million shares by Roper during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 through the second quarter of fiscal 1999. The buy-back program was terminated in May 1999. 17 Other components of comprehensive earnings represented the change in cumulative translation adjustments related to the net assets of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. The net change during each of fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 was related to Roper’s subsidiaries in Europe and Japan. Net cash provided by operating activities declined by $24.7 million, or 31%, primarily as a result of a $10.6 million increase in accounts receivable as compared to a $12.7 million decrease in the fiscal years ended October 31, 1999 and October 31, 1998, respectively. The reduction in 1998 was attributable to exceptional Gazprom cash receipts and the increase in 1999 arose primarily at Roper Scientific and Integrated Designs largely as a result of increased fourth quarter business levels. The following table summarizes net sales orders and sales order backlog information (dollars in thousands): Net sales ordersYear ended October 31, Sales order backlogOctober 31, 1999 1998 1999 1998 Actual Pro forma Actual Actual Pro forma Actual Analytical Instrumentation $148,478 $137,190 $111,637 $30,000 $32,153 $28,898 Fluid Handling 100,600 95,886 94,470 14,375 12,746 12,746 Industrial Controls 150,604 178,396 176,228 29,286 39,035 39,035 $399,682 $411,472 $382,335 $73,661 $83,934 $80,679 On a pro forma basis to include fiscal 1999 acquisitions for the comparable prior year period, Analytical Instrumentation’s net sales orders and sales order backlog were up 8% and down 7%, respectively, in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. Consolidated pro forma net sales orders and sales order backlog were down 3% and down 12%, respectively. Actual compared to pro forma results were about the same for the Fluid Handling and Industrial Controls segments. The 33% increase in Analytical Instrumentation’s net sales orders was due to the full-year contributions of Acton Research and Photometrics, the partial-year contribution of Petroleum Analyzer and strengthened digital imaging markets in fiscal 1999 (which also accounts for the pro forma increase). Fluid Handling’s net sales orders increased from its stronger centrifugal pump business and the increased sales order backlog reflected much better semiconductor industry conditions. Decreased Industrial Controls’ net sales orders reflected weak oil & gas industry conditions. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital was $129.5 million at October 31, 2000 compared to $89.6 million at October 31, 1999. Total debt was $241.3 million at October 31, 2000 (47% of total capital) compared to $130.5 million at October 31, 1999 (36% of total capital). Roper’s increased financial leverage at October 31, 2000 compared to the prior year was due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2000 business acquisitions. 18 Roper’s principal $275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of its daily external financing requirements, consisting of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit. This facility also provides that up to $75 million of borrowings may be denominated in designated non-U.S. currencies. At October 31, 2000, $79.0 million of U.S. denominated borrowings and the equivalent of $28.6 million of non-U.S. denominated borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Total unused availability under this facility was $166.6 million at October 31, 2000. This facility matures May 2005. Roper’s outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2000 also included $125 million of term notes. One set of notes totaling $40 million bears interest at 7.58% and matures May 2007. The other set of notes totaling $85 million bears interest at 7.68% and matures May 2010. Neither set of notes requires sinking fund payments. Roper’s other outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2000 totaled $8.7 million. $6.4 million of this amount was with Japanese banks to fund normal business requirements of its Japanese operations. Most of the increase in working capital at October 31, 2000 compared to October 31, 1999 resulted from the working capital of the businesses acquired during fiscal 2000. Approximately $28 million of working capital, excluding cash, was acquired with these businesses. Another large increase in working capital resulted from refinancing the short-term German revolving credit facility borrowings of $15.9 million that existed at October 31, 1999. This agreement was replaced by the non-U.S. borrowing capabilities of the $275 million credit facility. Roper had significant capital expenditures of $15.2 million during the year ended October 31, 2000 in order to expand or move to larger facilities at Roper Pump, Cornell Pump and Compressor Controls. Research and development-related capital expenditures were also significant at Gatan and Roper Scientific, two of Roper’s digital imaging businesses. Roper anticipates capital expenditures will decline in fiscal 2001. In November 2000, Roper’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock from $0.07 per share to $0.075 per share, an increase of 7%. This represents the eighth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Roper’s 1992 initial public offering. There are no plans for further dividend increases during fiscal 2001. Roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under its various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although Roper maintains an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on Roper’s activities, financial condition and results of operations. Roper may also explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources. 19 Roper anticipates that its recently acquired companies as well as its other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which Roper historically has experienced. However, the rate at which Roper can reduce its debt during fiscal 2001 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 133 – “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (and subsequently amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138) that will be applicable to Roper in its first quarter of fiscal 2001. Once adopted, this standard is not expected to significantly affect Roper’s financial position, operating results or disclosures. See Note 1 to Roper’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this pronouncement. The Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 101 – “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” that will be applicable to Roper in its first quarter of fiscal 2001. SAB 101 reflects the basic principles of revenue recognition in existing generally accepted accounting principles and does not supersede any existing authoritative literature. SAB 101 represents the interpretations and practices of the Securities and Exchange Commission in administering the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. Once adopted, these guidelines are not expected to significantly affect Roper’s revenue recognition practices. See Note 1 to Roper’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this pronouncement. Other accounting pronouncements have also been released whose effective dates were not yet applicable to Roper’s fiscal 2000 financial statements. However, none of these other standards are expected to significantly affect Roper’s future financial statements. Outlook Fiscal 2001 is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings. Fiscal 2001 is expected to benefit from the full-year contributions from all of the acquisitions completed during fiscal 2000. Whereas the oil & gas industry has been a difficult market for Roper during the past two fiscal years, Roper’s Industrial Controls segment (the segment most dependent on this industry) had its highest level of sales and sales order bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 than in any other quarter during this period. Roper is hopeful that this trend will continue. As announced previously, Roper has extended its long-term supply agreement with Gazprom whereby Gazprom will be supplied with an additional $150 million of equipment over and above the original agreement through December 2007. Roper expects that this extension will result in relatively consistent shipments to Gazprom in the near term. 20 Roper expects to continue an active acquisition program. However, completion of future acquisitions and their impact on Roper’s results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted. Forward Looking Information The information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report, in Roper’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases and in other public disclosures contains forward-looking statements about Roper’s businesses and prospects. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “likely,” “will” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe Roper’s objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which generally are beyond Roper’s control and which may cause Roper’s actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. Some of these risks include continuing improvement in Roper’s oil & gas markets, the level and timing of future business with Gazprom and other Eastern European customers, changes in interest rates, and the future operating results of the recently- and any newly-acquired companies. There is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on Roper’s future operations, financial condition, or financial results. 21 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings. It is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. It is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock. At October 31, 2000, Roper had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable-rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). Although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. At October 31, 2000, interest rates were higher than the fixed rates on the term notes. This resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being less than the face amounts of the notes. Roper estimated this difference to be $2.4 million and it represented an unrecorded increase in Roper’s net assets at October 31, 2000. If interest rates had been 0.1% higher, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have increased to $3.2 million. At October 31, 2000, Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $107.6 million. An increase in interest rates of 0.1% would increase Roper’s annualized interest costs by $108,000. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros (or equivalent currencies), British pounds or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 20% of Roper’s total sales. The U.S. dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal 2000 (British pound: 13% and Japanese yen: 4%) and especially against the Euro (25%) and especially during the fourth quarter (11%). These exchange rate changes adversely impacted fiscal 2000 sales by approximately $9.2 million, or less than 2% of total sales. The percentage impact on earnings was similar. A similar strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies in fiscal 2001 can be expected to have a similar adverse impact on Roper’s financial results. The weakening of these currencies during fiscal 2000 also resulted in a reduction of net assets that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings. The decrease during fiscal 2000 was $6.7 million. However, Roper’s future cash flow exposure to this change in exchange rates was expected to be minimal. The traded price of Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in Roper’s financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. Certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly related to Roper’s stock price. The stock price also affects Roper’s employees’ perceptions of various Roper programs that involve its common stock. 22",2023-12-30 21:34:13.790989
