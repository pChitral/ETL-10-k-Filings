865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2008,"Item 7. - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. 37 Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: • the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; • maintenance of our brand images and product quality; • profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also “Part I, Item 1. - Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); • restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; • protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; • limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier’s production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can and copacking availability; • the imposition of additional restrictions. (See also “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors”) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: • growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; • new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; • premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; • significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; • proper positioning to capture industry growth; and • broadening distribution/expansion opportunities. 38 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns * $ 1,025,795 $ 696,322 $ 415,417 47.3% 67.6% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 121,330 90,548 66,531 34.0% 36.1% Net sales 904,465 605,774 348,886 49.3% 73.6% Cost of sales 436,452 289,180 166,343 50.9% 73.8% Gross profit 468,013 316,594 182,543 47.8% 73.4% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 51.7% 52.3% 52.3% Operating expenses 237,027 158,015 79,100 50.0% 99.8% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 26.2% 26.1% 22.7% Operating income 230,986 158,579 103,443 45.7% 53.3% Operating income as a percent of net sales 25.5% 26.2% 29.6% Interest and other income, net 8,770 3,660 1,351 139.6% 170.9% Income before provision for income taxes 239,756 162,239 104,794 47.8% 54.8% Provision for income taxes 90,350 64,290 42,019 40.5% 53.0% Net income $ 149,406 $ 97,949 $ 62,775 52.5% 56.0% Net income as a percent of net sales 16.5% 16.2% 18.0% Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.64 $ 1.09 $ 0.71 50.3% 53.0% Diluted $ 1.51 $ 0.99 $ 0.65 52.6% 52.9% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 98,453 72,740 48,214 35.3% 50.9% * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. 39 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $329.5 million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks (introduced in September 2004) and Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), Monster M-80TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007), Monster MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, Unbound Energy® energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2005) and Hansen's® fruit juice smoothies. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault™ energy drinks and Monster Energy® Khaos™ energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, Monster M-80™ energy drinks, Monster MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks, iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. 40 Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million for year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks and Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80TM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks and Joker Mad Energy™ drinks. Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributor and exlcusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of 2.5 million in 41 insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of approximately $2.2 million or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $72.4 million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for 2007 from 26.2% for 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared to 28.9% for 2006. Interest and Other Income, net. Net interest and other income was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 million from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 39.6% for 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that is exempt from federal income taxes and a reduction in federal taxes attributable to the domestic production tax deduction. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for federal or state income tax purposes. Net Income. Net income was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and other income of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of $26.1 million. 42 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks which were introduced in August 2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of $24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for 2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. As a result the percentage increase in gross sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Lost® Energy™ drinks, sports drinks, Rumba™ brand energy juice, Junior Juice®, Ace™ energy drinks and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s® energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade® energy sports drinks. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost® Energy™ drinks, RumbaTM brand energy juice, AceTM energy drinks and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade® energy sports drinks. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net sales of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Junior Juice® and sports drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross profit as a 43 percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. In addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose, PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. ***Gross Profit – see definition above. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and administrative expenses. Selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties, and $1.8 million for sampling programs. General and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) which was not expensed in the previous year including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million related to stock based compensation and related charges (See Part II, Item 8, Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies – Other”), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company’s special investigation of stock option grants. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen’s® energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for 44 the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Interest and Other Income, net. Net interest and other income was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company’s invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2006 was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of California which have lower state tax rates. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. Net Income. Net income was $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities –Net cash provided by operating activities was $135.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $76.4 million in the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $149.4 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $10.2 million of share-based compensation and $2.1 million of depreciation and other amortization. In 2007, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $31.8 million increase in income taxes payable, a $22.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $19.1 million increase in deferred revenue and a $1.5 million increase in accrued compensation. In 2007, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $29.5 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options, a $26.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $21.1 million increase in inventories, a $14.2 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $0.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a $3.2 million decrease in customer deposit liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. The increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. Cash flows used in investing activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $95.2 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office furniture 45 and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the Company’s brands. At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our short-term investments include variable rate demand notes. Although the underlying maturities of these securities are long-term in nature, the investments are classified as short-term because they contain a ‘put’ feature which allows the holder to tender the securities at par on seven days notice. The ‘put’ feature is supported by a letter of credit or standby purchase agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial bank. The notes are issued by municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and the interest rate payable on these investments resets on a weekly basis. All of our short-term investments are held by major financial institutions. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. These notes carry a AAA credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. In February 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. There is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently these securities have been classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements. However, we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refinance their notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest rates now payable on such securities. If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. (See also “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors- Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments” and “Part I, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks”). 46 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities – Net cash provided by financing activities was $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $29.5 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $8.2 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Debt and other obligations – HBC has entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2008. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2007. Letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2007. The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2007. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. (See also “Part II, Item 8 - Note 9, Commitments & Contingencies”). Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2007: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 45,317 $ 26,052 $ 17,552 $ 1,713 $ - Capital Leases 663 663 - - - Operating Leases 23,482 3,338 8,024 4,533 7,587 Purchase Commitments 7,428 7,428 - - - $ 76,890 $ 37,481 $ 25,576 $ 6,246 $ 7,587 In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), dated as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain 47 capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company’s maximum liability under this agreement is $6.0 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the Company’s current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December 2008. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace our existing office space. We have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of that lease term which expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company's estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for the Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for the Company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in 48 cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets –Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2007. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2007, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiary are translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”. The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiary should be its local 49 currency. The accounts of this foreign subsidiary have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses. Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. Gains and losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 were insignificant. Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company’s products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are copacked on the Company’s behalf by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)”. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price 50 volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. Income Taxes – Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company's judgment. If the Company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB has deferred the implementation of SFAS No. 157 by one year for certain non-financial assets and liabilities such that this will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. The Company’s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansen’s products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen’s products expands outside of California. The Company’s experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of the Company’s sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, 51 seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A. – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose, milk and cream, and high fructose corn syrup, which are used in many of the Company’s products), changes in interest rates on the Company’s long-term debt and limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, cans, PET plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners or packaging arrangements, or protecting against shortages of such ingredients or raw materials. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short term investments. Certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. 54 At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See also “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments” and “Part I, Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”)",2023-12-30 21:14:02.736005

Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · maintenance of our brand images and product quality; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also “Part I, Item 1. - Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; 39 · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier’s production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; · the imposition of additional restrictions; and · (See also “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors”) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; · new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; · premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; · proper positioning to capture industry growth; and · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities 40 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns * $ 696,322 $ 415,417 $ 224,098 67.6 % 85.4 % Less: Promotional and other allowances** 90,548 66,531 43,757 36.1 % 52.0 % Net sales 605,774 348,886 180,341 73.6 % 93.5 % Cost of sales 289,180 166,343 96,875 73.8 % 71.7 % Gross profit 316,594 182,543 83,466 73.4 % 118.7 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.3 % 52.3 % 46.3 % Operating expenses 158,015 79,100 49,580 99.8 % 59.5 % Operating income 158,579 103,443 33,886 53.3 % 205.3 % Operating income as a percent of net sales 26.2 % 29.6 % 18.8 % Interest income, net 3,660 1,351 52 170.9 % 2,498.1 % Income before provision for income taxes 162,239 104,794 33,938 54.8 % 208.8 % Provision for income taxes 64,290 42,019 13,551 53.0 % 210.1 % Net income $ 97,949 $ 62,775 $ 20,387 56.0 % 207.9 % Net income as a percent of net sales 16.2 % 18.0 % 11.3 % Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.09 $ 0.71 $ 0.24 53.0 % 196.9 % Diluted $ 0.99 $ 0.65 $ 0.22 52.9 % 201.2 % Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 72,740 48,214 29,760 50.9 % 62.0 % * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. 41 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Segment Reclassification. RumbaTM brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment. Similarly, Hansen’s® energy drinks, which were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse segment. For presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006. The comparable figures for such products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been recast to reflect the above reclassification. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks which were introduced in August 2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of 24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for 2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. As a result the percentage increase in gross sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in 2003), Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks (introduced in September 2004), as well as sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005). To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Lost® Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2004), sports drinks, Rumba™ brand energy juice (introduced December 2004), Junior Juice®, Ace™ energy drinks (introduced in August 2006) and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s® energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade® energy sports drinks. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost® Energy™ drinks, RumbaTM brand energy juice, AceTM energy drinks and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade® energy sports drinks. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net sales of $86.0 million for the year 42 ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Junior Juice® and sports drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. In addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose, PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and administrative expenses. Selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties, and $1.8 million for sampling programs. General and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R which was not expensed in the previous year (see Part II, Item 8, Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”) including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million relating to stock based compensation and related charges (see Part II, Item 8, Note 13, “Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices”), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company’s special investigation of stock option grants. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the 43 DSD segment was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen’s® energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Interest Income, net. Net interest income was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company’s invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and, certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of California which have lower state tax rates. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. Net Income. Net income was $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Segment Reclassification. RumbaTM brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment. Similarly, Hansen’s® energy drinks, which were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse segment. For presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006. The comparable figures for such products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been restated to reflect the above reclassification. Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3 million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in “Net Sales.” The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in 44 the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods. *Gross sales – see definition above Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We again achieved record sales in 2005. The increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® drinks, which were introduced in April 2002, including our lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy® AssaultTM energy drinks, which were introduced in September 2004, sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, which were introduced in August 2005, increased sales by volume of Lost® EnergyTM energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad EnergyTM drinks which were introduced in January 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks and Rumba™ which was introduced in December 2004. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s Natural Sodas®, Hansen’s® energy drinks, Energade® and Smoothies in cans. Net sales case volumes (calculated on 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or 62.0%. The overall average net sales price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $6.06 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 19.5%. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as described below. Net sales for the DSD segment were $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $163.5 million or 164.4% higher than net sales of $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® drinks, including our lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, our Monster Energy® Assault TM energy drinks, sales of Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, increased sales by volume of Lost® EnergyTM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad EnergyTM drinks and RumbaTM energy juice. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Energade®. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $5.1 million or 6.3% higher than net sales of $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Hansen’s® apple juice and juice blends, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans, Hansen’s® energy drinks and Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1 million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of Monster Energy® and Lost® EnergyTM energy drinks. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. *** Gross Profit – see definition above 45 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $29.5 million or 59.6% over total operating expenses of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and have been included in operating expenses. Selling. Selling expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $21.5 million or 73.7% over selling expenses of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses which increased by $9.7 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, which increased by $4.2 million, increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $3.0 million, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements which increased $1.7 million, increased expenditures for advertising which increased by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by $1.2 million. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $8.0 million or 39.4% over general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6 million, distributor termination payments which increased by $1.2 million and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $0.7 million. Amortization of Trademarks. Amortization of trademarks was $0.07 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $0.003 million from amortization of trademarks of $0.073 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in amortization of trademarks was due to a reduction in the balance of definite life trademarks. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $73.9 million or 210.5% higher than contribution margin of $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and Lost® EnergyTM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $0.8 million or 8.3% higher than contribution margin of $9.6 million for year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of apple juice and juice blends which was offset by the reduced contribution from lower sales of Hansen’s® energy drinks. Operating Income. Operating income was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $69.6 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. 46 Interest Income, net. Net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net interest income of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net interest income consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash balances in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.4 million compared to interest income of $0.09 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.08 million compared to $0.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capital leases entered into during 2005. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $42.0 million which was an increase of $28.4 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2005 was 40.1%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 39.9% for 2004. Net Income. Net income was $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net income of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $99.1 million increase in gross profit and an increase of net interest income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $29.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $28.4 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $54.6 million in the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $97.9 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $8.3 million of share-based compensation and $1.5 million of depreciation and other amortization. In 2006, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $20.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $14.0 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.7 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in income taxes payable, a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.3 million increase in customer deposit liabilities. In 2006, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.6 million increase in inventories, a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and a $10.9 million increase in deferred income taxes. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. The increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $95.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $3.2 million provided by investing activities in the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the marketing and promotional activities of the Company, production equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess 47 of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short-term investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the Company’s brands. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities – Net cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $0.1 million for the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of $27.7 million of the Company’s common stock and principal payments of long-term debt of $1.2 million in relation to lease payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past year. In 2006, cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a $17.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and by proceeds of $3.9 million received from the issuance of common stock. Debt and other obligations – HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowing under the revolving line of credit from $7.5 million collateralized to $10.0 million non-collateralized. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through June 1, 2008. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2006. The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2006. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations under our agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company and other commitments. (See also “Part II, Item 8 - Note 10, Commitments & Contingencies”). Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2006: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 26,459 $ 13,197 $ 13,142 $ 120 $ — Capital Leases 303 299 4 — — Operating Leases 26,198 3,079 6,033 4,966 12,120 Purchase Commitments 25,385 21,554 3,831 — — $ 78,345 $ 38,129 $ 23,010 $ 5,086 $ 12,120 48 In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), dated as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company’s maximum liability under this agreement is $8.6 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the Company’s current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December 2007. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. In October 2006, the Company entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space will replace the Company’s existing warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. We plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of the lease. In October 2006, the Company also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the new leased warehouse and distribution facility located in Corona, California for the purpose of constructing a new office building thereon which will replace the Company’s existing office space in Corona, California. In the interim, the Company has leased additional office space located near our existing corporate offices. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 49 Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for the Company’s products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for the Company’s products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2006. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2006, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. 50 In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Amounts paid to the Company by newly appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating certain of the Company’s prior distributors are accounted for as deferred revenue which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective AB Distribution Agreements. Net Sales – Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation, and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. 51 Income Taxes – Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company’s judgment. If the Company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. The Company’s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansen’s products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen’s products expands outside of California. The Company’s experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of the Company’s sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A. – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, which are used in many of the Company’s products), changes in interest rates on the Company’s long-term debt and limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectibility of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s debt consisted of amounts owed in connection with certain fixed-rate capital leases. There have been no significant changes to the Company’s exposure to market risks.",2023-12-30 21:14:13.011697
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to — and should be read in conjunction with — our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business — a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations — an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Liquidity and Capital Resources — an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Sales — details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation — information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Forward Looking Statements — cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks — Information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A — Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional” drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice® juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen’s® brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names: Monster Energy®; Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™; Lost® Energy™ and Joker Mad Energy™ brand names as well as Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juices. We also market, sell and distribute the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. Additionally, we market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky® brand name. In July 2008, we began to market, sell and distribute enhanced water beverages under the Vidration™ brand name. We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks include Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks (introduced in September 2004), Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), Monster Energy® M-80TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007, named “RIPPER” in certain countries), Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007) and Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007). 34 A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 90.7%, 89.5% and 84.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Competitive pressure in the “energy drink” category could adversely affect our operating results. (See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors”). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research. Our extreme sports team endorsements include teams such as the Pro Circuit — Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Ken Block Rally Racing Team and the Tech 3 Moto GP Team (new for 2009). Our individual athlete and/or personality endorsements include extreme sports figures and athletes such as NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racer Ricky Carmichael, Moto GP motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi (new for 2009), television personalities such as Rob Dyrdek as well as many athletes that compete in other sports related activities, particularly, the Winter and Summer X-Games, supercross, motocross, freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile freestyle, snowmobile racing, etc. Our event endorsements include a wide range of events such as the Monster Energy® Supercross Series, the AMA Pro Motocross Championship Series and the Vans Warped Tour. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen’s® products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2008, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster Energy® and Lost® EnergyTM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juice, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC North American Coordination Agreement”) with The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”). Pursuant to the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in 35 the future may designate, territories in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of partially owned and independent bottlers, including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (“CCE”), Coca-Cola Bottling Company (“CCBC”), CCBCC Operations, LLC (“Consolidated”), United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC (“United”), and other TCCC independent bottlers (collectively, the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United States and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in portions of twenty-four U.S. states (the “U.S. Territories”). We may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S. Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing on January 1, 2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various territories within the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC International Coordination Agreement”) with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell the Products. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been appointed to distribute directly and through certain sub-distributors the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco. Pursuant to the new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors as discussed above, net amounts of $113.0 million and $21.0 million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating certain of our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled $90.7 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue recognized was $14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the $14.3 million of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, is $11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. We incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to $118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million in aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Accrued distributor terminations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (representing termination costs not paid to our prior distributors prior to the end of the fiscal year) were $102.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. In addition, inventory returned to us by certain of our prior terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As discussed under Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter 36 ended March 31, 2007, a special committee of our Board of Directors concluded its review of our stock option grants and granting practices. In connection with this review, and with respect to related litigation and other related matters, we incurred professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Balance Sheet Items (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Included in Deferred Revenue: Contributions from, net of reimbursements to certain distributors $ 112,963 $ 21,029 $ 20,851 Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Included in Net Sales: Recognition of deferred revenue $ 14,331 $ 1,916 $ 411 Included in Operating Expenses: Termination costs to prior distributors1 $ 118,134 $ 15,266 $ 12,728 Professional service fees (net of insurance proceeds) associated with the review of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters $ (202 ) $ 9,760 2 $ 3,753 1 includes terminations in Canada and Mexico 2 net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements We again achieved record gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales in 2008 was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products, particularly our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to increased sales by volume of our Java MonsterTM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Our percentage increase in gross sales was 15.3%, 47.3% and 67.6% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe our growth rate decline was attributable to the decline of the overall growth rates in the markets in which we operate, and more recently, to general economic conditions. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in the U.S. economy, an uncertain economic 37 outlook or an expanded credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global financial markets and economic environment, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers for our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to us regarding general economic conditions (See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors”). Gross sales shipped outside of California represented 77%, 73% and 69% of our gross sales, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $96.3 million, $55.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such sales were approximately 8.2%, 5.4% and 3.5% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reclassification of certain military customers from gross sales to customers within the United States to gross sales to customers outside the United States, resulted in an increase in gross sales outside the United States of $14.8 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, over amounts previously reported. Our customers are primarily retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported. 2008 2007 2006 Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 8% 8% 12% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 14% 14% 14% Full service distributors 74% 73% 69% Health food distributors 1% 2% 2% Other 3% 3% 3% Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. 38 Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth — We believe “functional”, “better for you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and channeling strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. · Cost Management — The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand. · Efficient Capital Structure — Our capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2009 and beyond. (See “Part II, Item 7 — Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007”). As of December 31, 2008, the Company had working capital of $374.0 million compared to $187.3 million as of December 31, 2007. The overall increase in working capital was primarily attributable to the transfer of our investments from long-term instruments to short-term instruments (See “Part II, Item 8, Note 3 — Investments” in our consolidated financial statements). For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $199.5 million as compared to $135.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Principal uses of cash flows are repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Payment of accrued distributor terminations, purchases of our common stock, accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See “Part II, Item 7 — Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continues to represent a challenge. We recognize 39 that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 — Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and copacking availability; · the imposition of additional restrictions. (See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors”) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · growth potential for the “alternative” beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters; · new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; · premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; · proper positioning to capture industry growth; and · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets. 40 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,182,876 $ 1,025,795 $ 696,322 15.3% 47.3% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 149,096 121,330 90,548 22.9% 34.0% Net sales¹ 1,033,780 904,465 605,774 14.3% 49.3% Cost of sales 494,986 436,452 289,180 13.4% 50.9% Gross profit¹ 538,794 468,013 316,594 15.1% 47.8% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.1% 51.7% 52.3% Operating expenses ²,³ 375,203 237,027 158,015 58.3% 50.0% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 36.3% 26.2% 26.1% Operating income¹,²,³ 163,591 230,986 158,579 (29.2%) 45.7% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 15.8% 25.5% 26.2% Interest and other income, net 9,886 8,770 3,660 12.7% 139.6% Income before provision for income taxes 173,477 239,756 162,239 (27.6%) 47.8% Provision for income taxes 65,445 90,350 64,290 (27.6%) 40.5% Net income $ 108,032 $ 149,406 $ 97,949 (27.7%) 52.5% Net income as a percentage of net sales 10.5% 16.5% 16.2% Net income per common share: Basic $1.17 $1.64 $1.09 (28.7%) 50.5% Diluted $1.11 $1.51 $0.99 (26.7%) 52.1% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 102,659 98,453 72,740 4.3% 35.3% ¹Includes $14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors. ²Includes $118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to expenditures attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. ³Includes ($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be 41 comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See”Part II, Item 6 — Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ (introduced in September 2008), Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration® vitamin enhanced water (introduced in July 2008). In addition, the increase in gross sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy® brand energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba® brand energy juice (introduced in December 2004), Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $27.8 million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.6% from 11.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales — see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net sales of $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in 42 net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration® vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, juice blends, iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, Hansen’s® energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher than the average net sales price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as well as the price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans effective January 1, 2008, price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 24-ounce cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases in our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the increase in the average net sales price per case was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $128.1 million, or 15.8% higher than net sales of $809.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks and Vidration® vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales of $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated 43 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. Such increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks that have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade marketing agreement costs. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $138.2 million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments and increased freight rates, increased expenditures of $17.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $4.1 million for sampling programs, increased expenditures of $3.1 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5 million for in-store demos and increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million (including a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation). The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise displays. The individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2008. Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution margin of $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was offset by increased sales of our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change 44 from high fructose corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased in price, for our soda lines. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and pineapple 64-ounce juice products. Juice blends are not eligible under the new program. Operating Income. Operating income was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $67.4 million, or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors; (ii) exclusive of expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest and Other Income, net. Net interest and other income was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.1 million from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. This increase was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Net Income. Net income was $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than net income of $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $24.9 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $329.5 million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks (introduced in September 2004) and Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), Monster Energy® M-80TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007), Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). 45 To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, Unbound Energy® energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2005) and Hansen’s® fruit juice smoothies. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales — see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks and Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, Monster Energy® M-80TM energy drinks, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks, iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million for year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks and Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster Energy® M-80TM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks and Joker Mad Energy™ drinks. Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 46 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million in insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated 47 dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of approximately $2.2 million or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $72.4 million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for 2007 from 26.2% for 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared to 28.9% for 2006. Interest and Other Income, net. Net interest and other income was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 million from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 39.6% for 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that is exempt from federal income taxes and a reduction in federal taxes attributable to the domestic production tax deduction. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for federal or state income tax purposes. Net Income. Net income was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and other income of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of $26.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities — Net cash provided by operating activities was $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $135.5 million in the comparable period in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $108.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $13.9 million of stock-based compensation and $3.4 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $98.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $98.1 million increase in accrued distributor terminations, a $30.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, a $7.5 million increase in accounts 48 payable, a $3.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to an $85.3 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.7 million increase in inventories, a $4.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $4.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options. The increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increased inventory levels. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities — Net cash provided by investing activities was $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $194.7 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. At December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See Part I, Item IA – “Risk Factors – Our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments”). Certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, certain of these securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that due to the default interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, certain issuers are likely to take steps to refinance their 49 notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the default interest rates now payable on such securities. At December 31, 2008, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $112.5 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, $8.1 million of our auction rate securities were redeemed at par, which are included in short-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. A Level 3 valuation was performed on the remaining $104.5 million of our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2008, which indicated an impairment of $14.9 million, resulting in a fair value of $89.6 million which is included in long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. In addition to our Level 3 valuation performed as of December 31, 2008, we also reviewed various factors in determining whether to record a temporary or other than temporary impairment charge related to the decline in fair value on our available-for sale securities, including length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any guarantors if applicable, any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that of the $14.9 million impairment on our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, we determined that $0.5 million of impairment was other-than-temporary and recorded a charge to interest and other income, net, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on our ability to access cash and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities — Net cash used in financing activities was $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $36.6 million for the comparable period in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008 cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the purchase by us of $103.5 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $4.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $2.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. On April 25, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. The Board of Directors also terminated the common stock repurchase program authorized in November 2005, under which we had purchased $27.7 million of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we purchased 3.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $26.77 per share, which we hold in treasury. 50 Debt and other obligations — We entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2008. Letters of credit issued on our behalf totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The terms of our line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2008. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $20.0 million through December 2009. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2008: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 52,982 $ 37,159 $ 15,823 $ - $ - Capital Leases 959 959 - - - Operating Leases 20,264 3,156 7,243 4,606 5,259 Purchase Commitments 44,632 44,498 134 - - $ 118,837 $ 85,772 $ 23,200 $ 4,606 $ 5,259 Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. (See “Part II, Item 8 — Note 11— Commitments & Contingencies”). Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), dated as of January 1, 2006, we have undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should we fail to purchase the minimum volume, we will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro- 51 rated basis. Our maximum liability under this agreement as of December 31, 2008 is $4.0 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we finalized licensing agreements with SAP America, Inc. for our global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software initiative which will replace existing legacy software. Our decision to replace our legacy software solutions and move to SAP technologies was based upon our current domestic needs, global expansion, systems scalability, improved integration with trading partners and customers, improved reporting, and business process efficiency and productivity. We estimate the cost for both licensing and implementation of the initiative to be approximately $5.5 million. The project is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2009 with a targeted production live date in the first quarter of 2010. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, which is currently in escrow. In August 2008, we completed the purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The properties are located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land to replace our existing office space. We have sublet a small portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, we continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as overflow for our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified in one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”). Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. A decline in the market value of any investment security below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary, results in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value. The 52 impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee company’s financial condition and information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2008. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. 53 Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2008, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are copacked on our behalf by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)”. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. 54 Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes – Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We consider future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, we will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment. If we subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for our financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In accordance with FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB 55 Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”), we elected to defer until January 1, 2009 the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for those assets and liabilities within the scope of FSP 157-2 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”), that clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157-3 is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which the financial statements have not been issued. The adoption of FSP 157-3 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that we use to measure fair value. · Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. · Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. · Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. SFAS No. 157 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We already record marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS No. 162”). This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for non-governmental entities. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (“PCAOB”) amendments to Interim Auditing Standards Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on of our consolidated financial statements. 56 In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP 142-3”). FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FSP 142-3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Sales of food bars, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our products expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average price per case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that 58 could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: · The current uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy; · Disruption in distribution or sales and/or decline in sales due to the termination of distribution agreements with certain of our existing distributors and the appointment of select Coca-Cola Bottlers and/or AB wholesalers as distributors for the territories of such terminated distributors. · The impact of the acquisition of AB by InBev; · Lack of anticipated demand for our products in international markets; · Unfavorable international regulations, including taxation requirements, tariffs or trade restrictions; · Any proceedings which may be brought against us by the SEC or other governmental agencies; · The outcome of the shareholder derivative actions and shareholders securities litigation filed against us and/or certain of our officers and directors, and the possibility of other private litigation; · The outcome of future auctions of auction rate securities and/or our ability to recover payment thereunder; · Our ability to address any significant deficiencies or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; · Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; · Decreased demand for our products resulting from changes in consumer preferences or from decreased consumer discretionary spending power; · Changes in demand that are weather related, particularly in areas outside of California; · Competitive products and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; · The introduction of new products; · An inability to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives; · Our ability to sustain the current level of sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks; · Laws and regulations and/or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws, as well as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, as well as changes in any other food and drug laws, especially those that may affect the way in which our products are marketed, and/or labeled, and/or sold, including the contents thereof, as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, and/or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, and/or the Federal Trade Commission and/or certain state regulatory agencies and/or any other countries in which we decide to sell our products; · Changes in the cost and availability of containers, packaging materials, raw materials and juice concentrates, and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and/or adequate production of all or any of our products; · Our ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others; there can be no assurance that we will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; · Our ability to penetrate new markets; · The marketing efforts of distributors of our products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with our products; · Unilateral decisions by distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time; · The terms and/or availability of our credit facility and the actions of our creditors; · The effectiveness of our advertising, marketing and promotional programs; · Changes in product category consumption; 59 · Unforeseen economic and political changes; · Possible recalls of our products; · Our ability to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing of any of our products; · Inability to protect and/or the loss of our intellectual property rights; · Failure to retain the full-time services of our senior management and inability to immediately find suitable replacements; · Volatility of stock prices which may restrict stock sales or other opportunities; · Provisions in our organizational documents and/or control by insiders which may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders; · The ability of our bottlers and contract packers to manufacture our products; · Exposure to significant liabilities due to litigation or legal proceedings; · Higher than expected implementation costs of the SAP system; conversion problems related to the SAP system that could disrupt the Company’s business and negatively impact customer relationships; the Company’s inability to complete the SAP implementation in the expected timeframe, which could negatively impact the Company’s operations and abilities to operate efficiently and measure performance. The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, cans, PET plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners or packaging arrangements, or protecting against shortages of such ingredients or raw materials. 60 Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 8.2% of consolidated gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates, as of December 31, 2008, to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short term investments. Certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. The applicable interest rate on auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. Based on an assessment of fair value as of December 31, 2008, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our auction rate securities of $14.9 million. We determined that of the $14.9 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, we determined that the remaining $0.5 million was other than temporary and recorded a charge in other income and expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2008. There is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See “Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors — Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments” and “Part I, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”).",2023-12-30 21:14:16.414559
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Forward Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices, juice blends, juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional” drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice® juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen’s® brand name. We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names: Monster Energy®, Monster Hitman Energy ShooterTM and Lost® EnergyTM brand names as well as Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juices. We market, sell and distribute the Java MonsterTM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks. We market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky® brand name. We market, sell and distribute enhanced water beverages under the VidrationTM brand name. In 2009 we introduced the following products: · Monster Energy® Import energy drink, which is packaged in 550 ml BRE aluminum cans manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States (May 2009). · X-Presso MonsterTM-Hammer, a non-carbonated espresso energy drink packaged in 6.75-ounce aluminum cans manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States (June 2009). 34 · NitrousTM Monster Energy®, a line of energy drinks which is carbonated and contains nitrous oxide, and is packaged in re-sealable 12-ounce sleek aluminum cap-cans, in three variants (July 2009). · Monster Energy® “Dub Edition” energy drink, which is packaged in 32-ounce aluminum cans (October 2009). · Hansen’s® Natural Lo-Cal, a new line of all natural, low calorie 64-ounce juice cocktails in four flavors (September 2009). The Lo-Cal juice cocktails are sweetened with TruviaTM brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener. · SELF Beauty ElixirTM by Hansen’s®, a new line of a low-calorie, functional, ready-to-drink beauty beverages infused with an essential blend of vitamins, minerals, natural fruit & botanical extracts with antioxidants (August 2009). · Blue Sky® Free Sodas, a new line of all natural, zero calorie sodas sweetened with TruviaTM brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener (September 2009). · Peace TeaTM, a new line of ready-to-drink iced teas in 23-ounce aluminum cans (December 2009). We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to “Corporate & Unallocated.” Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks include Monster Energy® energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® energy drinks, Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks, Monster Energy® KhaosTM energy drinks, Monster Energy® M-80TM energy drinks (named “RIPPER” in certain countries), Monster Energy® Heavy MetalTM energy drinks, Monster Energy® MIXXDTM energy drinks, Monster Energy® Import energy drinks and Monster Energy® Dub Edition energy drinks. Our Java MonsterTM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks include Java MonsterTM OriginaleTM, Java MonsterTM Loca Moca®, Java MonsterTM Mean Bean®, Java MonsterTM Russian, Java MonsterTM Irish BlendTM, Java MonsterTM Chai HaiTM, Java MonsterTM Nut UpTM and Java MonsterTM Lo-Ball as well as our X-Presso MonsterTM-Hammer energy drink. A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java MonsterTM product line. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or Java MonsterTM product line could cause a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 91.9%, 90.7% and 89.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 8.1%, 9.3% and 10.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers. We also utilize prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements, including from television and other well known sports personalities, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, 35 outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen’s® products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2009, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our distribution markets, both domestically and internationally. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster Energy® and Lost® EnergyTM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juice, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, territories in which the TCCC North American Bottlers will distribute and sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United States and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in the U.S. Territories. We may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S. Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing on January 1, 2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various territories within the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC International Coordination Agreement with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell the Products. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been appointed to distribute directly and through certain sub-distributors the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a distribution agreement with Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, for exclusive distribution throughout Mexico, excluding the Baja and Sonora regions, of our Monster Energy® and Monster Energy® 36 KhaosTM energy drinks as well as select Java MonsterTM product line drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced January 26, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a distribution agreement with Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. for exclusive distribution throughout Australia of certain of our Monster Energy® energy drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced in July 2009. Pursuant to the new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, net amounts of $5.7 million and $113.0 million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating certain of our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled $5.2 million and $90.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenue recognized was $7.5 million, $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in the $14.3 million of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, is $11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. We incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to $1.9 million, $118.1 million and $15.3 million in aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Accrued distributor terminations as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $3.0 million and $102.3 million, respectively. In addition, inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. We again achieved record gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross sales in 2009 was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products, particularly our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java MonsterTM product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our percentage increase in gross sales was 10.7%, 15.3% and 47.3%, respectively. We believe the decrease in the year on year percentage growth rate was in part attributable to the decrease in the overall growth rates of the markets in which we operate, in particular of the energy drink category, to general economic conditions as well as higher overall comparable sales levels. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In 37 addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in both the U.S. and international economies where we market and distribute our products, an uncertain economic outlook or prolonged credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower than expected net sales and profits on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2009 and 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global and local financial markets and economic environments, real estate markets and construction industries, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers for our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to our Company posed by general economic conditions (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $168.0 million, $94.2 million and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such sales were approximately 12.8%, 8.0% and 5.2% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reclassification of a portion of our gross sales to certain military customers to gross sales to customers within the United States from gross sales to customers outside the United States, resulted in a decrease in gross sales outside the United States of $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, over amounts previously reported. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors’ sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include our sales to such full service distributors without reference to their sales to their own customers. The allocations below reflect changes made by us to the categories historically reported. 2009 2008 2007 Full service distributors 66% 68% 69% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 12% 14% 14% Outside the U.S. 13% 8% 5% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 6% 8% 9% Other 3% 2% 3% Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway, Inc. and SUPERVALU Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCE, a customer of the DSD segment with sales within specific markets in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in Europe, accounted for approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 13% and 16% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of 38 TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional”, “image based” or “better for you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and channeling strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supply and production costs. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2010 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008”). As of December 31, 2009, the Company had working capital of $501.8 million compared to $374.0 million as of December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in trade accounts receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accrued distributor terminations. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $156.2 million as compared to $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Principal uses of cash flows in 2009 were distributor termination fees, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Purchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, payments of accounts payable and income taxes are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). 39 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; · the potential impact of the consummation of the transactions between CCE and TCCC; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; and 40 · the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions, increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · growth potential for the “alternative” beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters; · new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; · premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; · proper positioning to capture industry growth; and · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets. 41 Results of Operations (In Thousands, Except Per Share Information) Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,309,335 $ 1,182,876 $ 1,025,795 10.7% 15.3% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 166,036 149,096 121,330 11.4% 22.9% Net sales¹ 1,143,299 1,033,780 904,465 10.6% 14.3% Cost of sales 530,983 494,986 436,452 7.3% 13.4% Gross profit***¹ 612,316 538,794 468,013 13.6% 15.1% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 53.6% 52.1% 51.7% Operating expenses 2 275,007 375,203 237,027 (26.7% ) 58.3% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 24.1% 36.3% 26.2% Operating income 1,2 337,309 163,591 230,986 106.2% (29.2% ) Operating income as a percentage of net sales 29.5% 15.8% 25.5% Other income (expense): Interest and other income, net 2,273 10,413 8,770 (78.2% ) 18.7% Other-than-temporary impairment of investments (3,887 ) (527 ) - 637.6% 100.0% Total other income (expense) (1,614 ) 9,886 8,770 Income before provision for income taxes 335,695 173,477 239,756 93.5% (27.6% ) Provision for income taxes 126,979 65,445 90,350 94.0% (27.6% ) Net income $ 208,716 $ 108,032 $ 149,406 93.2% (27.7% ) Net income as a percentage of net sales 18.3% 10.5% 16.5% Net income per common share: Basic $2.32 $1.17 $1.64 98.7% (28.7% ) Diluted $2.21 $1.11 $1.51 99.1% (26.7% ) Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 109,985 102,659 98,453 7.1% 4.3% ¹Includes $8.2 million, $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. ²Includes $1.9 million, $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to expenditures attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal 42 reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See” Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $126.5 million, or 10.7% higher than gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink, as well as increased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ product line and our Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line, our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, apple juice and juice blends. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $16.9 million, or 11.4% higher than promotional and other allowances of $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for year ended December 31, 2009 was slightly higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. 43 Net Sales. Net sales were $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $109.5 million, or 10.6% higher than net sales of $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink as well as increased sales by volume of our Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line, our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks and apple juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our then customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 7.3 million cases or 7.1% higher than case sales of 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009 or 3.2% higher than the average net sales price per case of $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,051.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $113.3 million, or 12.1% higher than net sales of $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line and our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks. Net sales for the DSD segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $3.8 million, or 4.0% lower than net sales of $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, sports drinks and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hansen’s Natural Sodas® and aseptic juice drinks as well as a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $73.5 million, or 13.6% higher than the gross profit of $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 53.6% for the year 44 ended December 31, 2009 from 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products, which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, as well as a decrease in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster™ product line, which have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. In addition, the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate. ***Gross profit – see definition above. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $100.2 million, or 26.7% lower than total operating expenses of $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $5.4 million for out-bound freight, decreased expenditures of $3.6 million for merchandise displays, decreased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees, including accounting and legal costs, decreased expenditures of $2.4 million for allocated trade development, decreased expenditures of $2.1 million for samples, decreased expenditures of $2.2 million for demos and decreased expenditures of $1.6 million for storage and warehouse costs. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by increased expenditures of $12.7 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $3.5 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $2.8 million for travel expenses, $2.8 million of increased depreciation costs, and increased expenditures of $2.1 million for advertising. Total operating expenses include costs of $24.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales, and $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in professional service fees are legal and accounting fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.3% and 24.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.2 million, or 80.1% higher than contribution margin of $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $5.5 million higher than contribution margin of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin as a result of decreases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, and by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the 45 termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with certain of our 64-ounce juice products. Operating Income. Operating income was $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.7 million, or 106.2% higher than operating income of $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $8.2 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) expenditures of $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) expenditures for professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.5% and 25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income included operating losses of $6.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in relation to the operations of MEL, MEEL and MEAU. Operating income included operating losses of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, in relation to the operations of X-Truck and EMF. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $11.5 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments as well as a $3.9 million other-than temporary impairment of long-term investments. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $61.5 million or 94.0% higher than the provision for income taxes of $65.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased operating income of $173.7 million. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.8% and 37.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income. Net income was $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $100.7 million or 93.2% higher than net income of $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. This was partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $61.5 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of $11.5 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ (introduced in September 2008), Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration® vitamin enhanced water (introduced in July 2008). In addition, the increase in gross 46 sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy® brand energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba® brand energy juice (introduced in December 2004), Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $27.8 million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.6% from 11.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net sales of $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy ShooterTM, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration® vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, juice blends, iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, Hansen’s® energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher than the average net sales price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as well as the price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans effective January 1, 2008, price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 24-ounce cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases in our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the increase in the average net sales price per case was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $128.1 million, or 15.8% higher than net sales of $809.8 million for the year 47 ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks and Vidration® vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales of $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. Such increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks that have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade marketing agreement costs. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $138.2 million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments and increased freight rates, increased expenditures of $17.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $4.1 million for sampling programs, increased expenditures of $3.1 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5 million for in-store demos and increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million (including a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation). The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise displays. The individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net 48 sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2008. Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution margin of $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was offset by increased sales of our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster MIXXDTM energy drinks and Monster Heavy MetalTM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change from high fructose corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased in price, for our soda lines. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and pineapple 64-ounce juice products. Juice blends are not eligible under the new program. Operating Income. Operating income was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $67.4 million, or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors; (ii) exclusive of expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 49 Other Income (expense). Other income (expense) was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.1 million from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. This increase was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Net Income. Net income was $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than net income of $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $24.9 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $208.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $14.0 million of stock-based compensation, $5.8 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $3.9 million impairment on investments and a $0.7 million provision for doubtful accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operations also increased due to an $86.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.5 million decrease in inventory, a $5.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $3.9 million increase in income taxes payable and a $0.8 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $99.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $59.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $15.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $6.8 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $3.1 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments and property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. 50 At December 31, 2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. The auction failures have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. At December 31, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million (amortized cost basis of $92.0 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on the Company’s auction rate securities as of December 31, 2009, which indicated an impairment of $12.1 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008, resulting in a fair value of $84.3 million, which is included in short- and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 320-10-65, which modifies the requirements for recognizing other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities and significantly changes the impairment model for such securities. Under ASC 320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more likely than not will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings. Under ASC 320-10-65, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a Credit Loss has occurred. In the event of a Credit Loss and absent the intent 51 or requirement to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, only the amount associated with the Credit Loss is recognized as loss in the income statement. The amount of loss relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company determined that of the $12.1 million impairment of its auction rate securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was temporary and $4.4 million was other-than-temporary. The other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. The Company recorded $3.9 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit Loss related through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary and was charged to interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2008). At December 31, 2009, $7.7 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based on our ability to access cash and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. Cash flows used in financing activities – Net cash used in financing activities was $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of common stock held in treasury of $86.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $2.5 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. On April 25, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we purchased 2.6 million and 3.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock at an average purchase price of $33.10 per share and $26.77 per share, respectively, which we hold in treasury. No shares were purchased during the year ended December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $10.2 million remained available under the plan for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock. Debt and other obligations – We have a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2009. Letters of credit issued on our behalf, totaling $0.2 million under this credit facility, were outstanding as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the terms of our line of credit, which contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the 52 line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $20.0 million through December 2010. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2009: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 51,176 $ 31,800 $ 19,376 $ - $ - Capital Leases 206 206 - - - Operating Leases 19,338 3,276 7,548 5,092 3,422 Purchase Commitments 42,216 42,216 - - - $ 112,936 $ 77,498 $ 26,924 $ 5,092 $ 3,422 Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. In addition to the above purchase obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce re-sealable aluminum beverage cans through December 31, 2010. The Company’s minimum purchase obligation under this agreement is approximately $27.3 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with certain conditions. In addition to the above purchase obligations, approximately $0.4 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2009, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.02 million and interest of $0.01 million as of December 31, 2009. In 2008, we entered into licensing and programming agreements with SAP America, Inc. to use its global enterprise resource planning software initiative to replace our existing legacy software in North America. The Company also entered into agreements with Axon Solutions, Inc. and Vistex Inc. for the implementation and configuration of the SAP software. As of January 2010, we had completed our North American transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system. It is our intention to complete the transition for our international operations within fiscal 2010. We estimate the remaining costs for implementation of the initiative will be approximately $0.8 million. 53 In October 2006, we entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. This warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09 acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we completed the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for a purchase price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land to replace our existing office space. We have sublet a small portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, we continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as additional warehousing to supplement our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Under ASC 320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee company’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the 54 issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite- 55 lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2009, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are 56 generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal 57 fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our products expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average price per case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21.E of the Exchange Act, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a 58 statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 60 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 12.8% and 8.0% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2009 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2009 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults, which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds. The applicable interest rate on auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. Based on an assessment of fair value as of December 31, 2009, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our auction rate securities of $12.1 million. We determined that of the $12.1 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2009. In addition, we determined that the remaining $3.9 million was an other-than-temporary Credit Loss and recorded a charge in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed 61 other-than-temporary and was charged to interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2008). There is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See “Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors – Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments” and “Part I, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).",2023-12-30 21:14:17.037203
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy®, Java Monster™, Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™, Monster Rehab™, Peace Tea™, Hansen’s®, Hansen’s Natural Sodas®, Junior Juice®, Blue Sky®, X-Presso Monster™, Vidration™, Worx Energy™, Admiral™, Lost® Energy™, Hubert’s™, Rumba®, Samba and Tango. Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks include Monster Energy® energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® energy drinks, Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks, Monster Energy® Khaos™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® M-80™ energy drinks (named “RIPPER” in certain countries), Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero energy drinks, Monster Energy® Import and Import Light energy drinks, Monster Energy® Dub Edition energy drinks, Monster Rehab™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® M3 Super Concentrate energy drink and Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks in four variants. 37 Our lines of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks include Java Monster™ Kona Blend, Java Monster™ Loca Moca®, Java Monster™ Mean Bean®, Java Monster™ Vanilla Light, Java Monster™ Irish Blend™, Java Monster™ Toffee as well as our X-Presso Monster™ Hammer and X-Presso Monster™ Midnite coffee energy drinks. In 2010 we introduced the following products: · Monster Energy® Import Light energy drinks, which are packaged in 18.6-ounce Re-sealable End (“BRE”) aluminum cans (May 2010). · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero energy drinks, which are carbonated and contain zero calories and zero sugar, and are packaged in 16-ounce aluminum cans (July 2010). · Monster Energy® “Dub Edition” energy drinks, which are packaged in 18.6-ounce BRE aluminum cans (May 2010). · Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drink – Black Ice which is carbonated and contains zero calories, packaged in 12-ounce sleek aluminum cap-cans (November 2010). · X-Presso Monster™ Coffee Energy Drinks – non-carbonated dairy based espresso + energy drinks, which are packaged in 9.6-ounce aluminum cans (November 2010). · Worx Energy™ energy shots, which contain zero calories and zero sugar, and are packaged in 2-ounce wide-mouth polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) plastic bottles (October 2010). · Monster Energy® M3 Super Concentrate, super-concentrated energy drinks, which are packaged in 5-ounce glass bottles (November 2010). · Admiral™ Iced Teas, a new line of ready-to-drink iced teas, which are packaged in 23-ounce aluminum cans (March 2010). · Blue Sky® Shots, natural functional shots, which are packaged in 2.5-ounce PET plastic bottles (March 2010). · Hubert’s™ Lemonades, a line of ready-to-drink premium lemonades sweetened with cane sugar and Truvia™ brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener, which are packaged in 16-ounce glass bottles (August 2010). · Hansen’s® Natural Fruit and Tea Stix™, a line of all-natural, low-calorie powdered drink mixes, which are packaged in single-serve stick packs (February 2010). We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to “Corporate & Unallocated.” We again achieved record gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross sales in 2010 was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the “Advance Purchases”). We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such Advance Purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. 38 A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java MonsterTM product line. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or Java MonsterTM product line could cause a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 93.0%, 91.4% and 89.7% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 7.0%, 8.6% and 10.3% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, our percentage increase in gross sales was 13.7%, 10.7%, and 15.3%, respectively. We believe the decrease in the year on year percentage growth rate for the 2009 fiscal year was in part attributable to the decrease in the overall growth rates of the markets in which we operate, in particular the energy drink category, to general economic conditions as well as higher overall comparable sales levels. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in both the U.S. and international economies where we market and distribute our products, an uncertain economic outlook or prolonged credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower than expected net sales and profits on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global and local financial markets and economic environments, real estate markets and construction industries, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers of our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to our Company posed by general economic conditions (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to achieve maximum demand from consumers for our products. We also utilize prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements, including from television and other well known sports personalities, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. 39 During 2010, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets, both domestically and internationally. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy drinks. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $240.6 million, $168.0 million and $94.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such sales were approximately 16%, 13% and 8% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors’ sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include our sales to such full service distributors without reference to their sales to their own customers. 2010 2009 2008 Full service distributors 64% 66% 68% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 12% 12% 14% Outside the U.S. 16% 13% 8% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 6% 6% 8% Other 2% 3% 2% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes the Products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed the Products. Concurrently with this acquisition, a new entity, which retained the name Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (“New CCE”) was formed, which currently distributes the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden (added during the first quarter of 2011). Our customers include CCR (formerly known as CCE), New CCE, CCRC (formerly known as CCBC), Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB Distributors, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada, ULC (“Pepsi Canada”) (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCE (including CCBC up to September 30, 2010) (CCE replaced by New CCE from October 1, 2010), accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD segment, accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The terminated DPS Group territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse segments, accounted for less than 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and approximately 11% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. 40 We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional”, “image based” and/or “better for you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on input supply and production costs. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues, as well as selling expenses including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses. Another key area of focus is, but not limited to, the reduction of inventory days on hand. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S., will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2011 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009”). As of December 31, 2010, the Company had working capital of $769.3 million compared to $501.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $229.0 million as compared to $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Principal uses of cash flows in 2010 were purchases of investments, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Purchases of investments, purchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, payments of accounts payable and income taxes are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). 41 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · the impact of a slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; · the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions; · increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; and · legislation that would limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy drinks can be sold.

Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See “Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $179.2 million, or 13.7% higher than gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea™ iced teas, increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line and increased sales by volume of our juice blends. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ product line, our Java Monster™ product line, apple juice, X-Presso Monster™ product line and Rumba®, Samba and Tango energy juices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, were $10.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $18.5 million, or 11.2% higher than promotional and other allowances of $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.4% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $160.6 million, or 14.1% higher than net sales of $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea™ iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line. The increase in net sales was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ product line, apple juice, our X-Presso Monster™ product line and our Java Monster™ product line. 44 Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately 19.0 million cases or 17.3% higher than case sales of 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009. The average net sales price per case decreased to $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010 which was 2.8% lower than the average net sales price per case of $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from lower priced products and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $167.5 million, or 16.0% higher than net sales of $1,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea™ iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ product line, our X-Presso Monster™ product line and our Java Monster™ product line. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of approximately $6.9 million, or 7.0% lower than net sales of $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Rumba®, Samba and Tango energy juices as well as increased promotional allowances. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of our juice blends. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $67.9 million, or 11.1% higher than the gross profit of $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to production variances and increased costs of goods including the costs of raw materials in the DSD and Warehouse segments, as well as product mix and geographic mix. ***Gross profit – see definition above. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $57.4 million, or 20.9% higher than total operating expenses of $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $15.0 million (of which $2.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation) and increased expenditures of $13.4 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Expenditures for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs and SAP implementation costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $21.5 million as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the 2009 comparative period included a $4.7 million credit related to reimbursements to the Company of legal expenses previously paid by the Company). In addition, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $11.2 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $6.2 million for point-of-sale materials, increased expenditures of $4.5 million for allocated trade development, increased depreciation expense of $1.6 million and increased expenditures of $2.2 million for other operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $1.6 million related to the costs associated with distributor terminations, decreased expenditures of $1.7 million for advertising, decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for samples and decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for commissions. 45 Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $45.0 million, or 11.5% higher than contribution margin of $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea™ iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately $4.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased net sales, increased off-invoice and promotional allowances and increased costs of goods. Operating Income. Operating income was $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 3.1% higher than operating income of $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million, partially offset by a $57.4 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negatively affected by operating losses of $9.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in relation to our operations in Europe, Australia and Brazil. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.1 million from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a loss on investments and put option of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss on investments and put option of ($3.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other income (expense) was partially offset by decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.3 million or 8.1% higher than the provision for income taxes of $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective combined federal and state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.3% from 37.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2010, lower state tax benefits and the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits that arose in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in tax rates was partially offset by the increase in tax benefits resulting from the Domestic Production Deduction. The effect of the valuation allowance and its related impact on the Company’s overall tax rate increased the provision for income taxes by $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net Income. Net income was $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.3 million or 1.6% higher than net income of $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million and a increase in other income (expense) of $3.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $57.4 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $10.3 million. 46 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $126.5 million, or 10.7% higher than gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink, as well as increased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ product line and our Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line, our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, apple juice and juice blends. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $16.9 million, or 11.4% higher than promotional and other allowances of $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for year ended December 31, 2009 was slightly higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales – see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $109.5 million, or 10.6% higher than net sales of $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink as well as increased sales by volume of our Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line, our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks and apple juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 47 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 7.3 million cases or 7.1% higher than case sales of 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009 or 3.2% higher than the average net sales price per case of $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $117.8 million, or 12.7% higher than net sales of $927.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line. Net sales for the DSD segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $8.3 million, or 7.8% lower than net sales of $106.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, sports drinks, Junior Juice® aseptic juices and our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hansen’s Natural Sodas® and aseptic juice drinks as well as a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $73.5 million, or 13.6% higher than the gross profit of $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products, which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, as well as a decrease in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster™ product line, which have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. In addition, the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate. ***Gross profit – see definition above. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $100.2 million, or 26.7% lower than total operating expenses of $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $5.4 million for out-bound freight, decreased expenditures of $3.6 million for merchandise displays, 48 decreased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees, including accounting and legal costs, decreased expenditures of $2.4 million for allocated trade development, decreased expenditures of $2.1 million for samples, decreased expenditures of $2.2 million for demos and decreased expenditures of $1.6 million for storage and warehouse costs. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by increased expenditures of $12.7 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $3.5 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $2.8 million for travel expenses, $2.8 million of increased depreciation costs, and increased expenditures of $2.1 million for advertising. Total operating expenses include costs of $24.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales, and $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in professional service fees are legal and accounting fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.3% and 24.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.0 million, or 79.1% higher than contribution margin of $218.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Monster Energy® Extra Strength Nitrous Technology™ product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $5.7 million higher than contribution margin of ($2.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin as a result of decreases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, and by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with certain of our 64-ounce juice products. Operating Income.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $8.2 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) expenditures of $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) expenditures for professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.5% and 25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other income (expense) was ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $11.5 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments as well as a $3.9 million other-than temporary impairment of long-term investments. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $61.5 million or 94.0% higher than the provision for income taxes of $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased operating income of $173.7 million. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.8% and 37.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income. Net income was $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $100.7 million or 93.2% higher than net income of $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. This was partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $61.5 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of $11.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $212.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $16.9 million of stock-based compensation, $11.7 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $4.5 million impairment loss on investments and $1.7 million of bad debt expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $37.1 million increase in accounts payable, a $9.4 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $12.5 million increase in income taxes payable, a $4.3 million decrease in distributor receivables and a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.0 million increase in inventory, a $12.4 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options, a $10.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $5.5 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $3.8 million gain on the Put Option (defined below), a $2.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.6 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $1.4 million decrease in deferred income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $208.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $14.0 million of stock-based compensation, $5.8 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $3.9 million impairment on investments and a $0.7 million provision for doubtful accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operations also increased due to an $86.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.5 million decrease in inventory, a $5.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $3.9 million increase in income taxes payable and a $0.8 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $99.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $59.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $15.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $6.8 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $3.1 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and a $3.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes. 50 Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $212.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments, while cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments and sales of available-for-sale investments, while cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities – Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $23.5 million of purchases of common stock held in treasury. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds of $20.8 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $12.4 million excess tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $86.2 million of purchases of common stock held in treasury. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – At December 31, 2010, we had $354.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $288.8 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. A large portion of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by 51 an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. The auction failures have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. In March 2010, we entered into an agreement (the “ARS Agreement”), related to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities (“ARS Securities”). Under the ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell these ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest (the “Put Option”) as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective ARS Securities when the auction process fails. During the year ended December 31, 2010, $7.4 million of par value ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. The ARS Agreement represents a firm commitment in accordance with ASC 815, which defines a firm commitment with an unrelated party, binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable, with the following characteristics: (i) the commitment specifies all significant terms, including the quantity to be exchanged, the fixed price, and the timing of the transaction; and (ii) the commitment includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable. The enforceability of the ARS Agreement results in a Put Option which is recognized as a separate freestanding asset and is accounted for separately from our auction rate securities. The Put Option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under ASC 815. Therefore, we elected the fair value option under ASC 825-10 in accounting for the Put Option. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded $3.8 million as the fair market value of the Put Option ($3.0 million current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.8 million long-term portion included in other assets) in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding gain of $3.8 million recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The valuation of the Put Option utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with the put issuer’s ability to repurchase the ARS Securities in installments as indicated above beginning March 22, 2011, and expected holding periods for the Put Option. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. The Put Option will continue to be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $79.6 million (amortized cost basis of $70.7 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2010 resulting in a fair value of $25.4 million for our available-for-sale auction rate securities (after a $7.4 million impairment) and $42.9 million for our trading auction rate securities, which are included in short- and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. 52 ASC 320-10-35 indicates that an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security, it must compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the entire amortized cost basis of the security will not be recovered (that is, a “Credit Loss” exists), and an other-than-temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred. In the event of a Credit Loss and absent the intent or requirement to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, only the amount associated with the Credit Loss is recognized as a loss in the income statement. The amount of loss relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). ASC 320-10-35 also requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of the Credit Loss and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired. In connection with the ARS Agreement, during the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we reclassified $54.2 million of auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading in accordance with ASC 320, as we have the ability and intent to exercise the related Put Option beginning March 22, 2011. We recognized a net loss through earnings on our trading securities of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. We determined that of the $7.4 million impairment of its available-for-sale auction rate securities at December 31, 2010, $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $5.0 million was deemed other-than-temporary. The other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. We recorded a net charge through earnings of $0.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit Loss related during the year ended December 31, 2010 ($3.9 million and $0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary Credit Loss related and were charged through earnings for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). At December 31, 2010, $2.4 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $1.0 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary impairment and other-than-temporary impairment included the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as the other factors included in the valuation model for debt securities described above. The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the Put Option during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (ii) the revaluation of the Put Option as of December 31, 2010; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the ARS Securities during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (iv) the revaluation of trading ARS Securities as of December 31, 2010; (v) the redemption of certain ARS Securities; (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; and (vii) an increase in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities, resulted in losses of $0.8 million, included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We hold additional auction rate securities that do not have a related put option. These auction rate securities continue to be classified as available-for-sale. We intend to retain our investment in the securities until the earlier of the anticipated recovery in market value or maturity. Based on our ability to access cash and cash equivalents and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, or uncertainties in the expected performance of the issuer of the Put Option arise, or there are rating downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. 53 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company purchased 0.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $37.68 per share for a total amount of $23.5 million, which the Company holds in treasury. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $33.10 per share for a total amount of $86.2 million, which the Company holds in treasury. Debt and other obligations – We entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2010, under which we may borrow up to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2012. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2010. Letters of credit issued on our behalf, totaling $0.3 million and $0.2 million under this credit facility, were outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the terms of our line of credit, which contains certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $30.0 million through December 31, 2011. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2010: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations $ 57,073 $ 31,834 $ 21,431 $ 3,808 $ - Capital Leases 274 274 - - - Operating Leases 19,188 3,366 9,287 5,680 855 Purchase Commitments 27,369 27,369 - - - $ 103,904 $ 62,843 $ 30,718 $ 9,488 $ 855 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. 54 In addition to the above purchase obligations, approximately $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2010, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2010. In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09 acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we completed the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for a purchase price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our leased warehouse and distribution space. We are examining various options to replace our existing leased head office space, including reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 “Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. 55 Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. 56 In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2010, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are 57 generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes – We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more 58 pronounced with the expansion of the distribution of our products outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could 61 harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable and inventory realization. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 16% and 13% of consolidated gross sales for both the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2010 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2010 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2010, we had $354.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $288.8 million in short- and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, U.S. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds. 62 In March 2010, we entered into the ARS Agreement, related to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities. Under the ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the ARS Securities when the auction process fails. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded $3.8 million as the fair market value of the Put Option ($3.0 million current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.8 million long-term portion included in other assets) in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding gain of $3.8 million recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. In connection with the ARS Agreement, during the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we reclassified $54.2 million of auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading, as we have the ability and intent to exercise the related Put Option beginning March 22, 2011. We recognized a loss on trading securities of $3.9 million through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, $7.4 million of par value ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. The applicable interest rate on our auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. Based on an assessment of fair value as of December 31, 2010, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our available for sale auction rate securities of $7.4 million. We determined that of the $7.4 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities at December 31, 2010, $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $5.0 million was deemed other-than-temporary. At December 31, 2010, $2.4 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $1.0 million, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). We recorded a net charge through earnings of $0.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit Loss related during the year ended December 31, 2010 ($3.9 million and $0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary Credit Loss related and were charged through earnings for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). There is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See “Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors – Our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments” and “Part I, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).",2023-12-30 21:14:18.678856
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Hansen’s® · Monster Rehab™ · Hansen’s Natural Soda® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Junior Juice® · Java Monster® · Blue Sky® · X-Presso Monster® · Hubert’s® · Worx Energy® · Vidration® · Peace Tea® 34 Table of Contents Our Monster Energy® drinks, which represented 91.2%, 89.9% and 90.0% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Energy® Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Monster Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Monster M-80® (named “RIPPER” in certain countries) · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Monster MIXXD® · Java Monster® Toffee · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Energy® Import Technology® Super Dry™ · Monster Energy® Import Light · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Energy® Dub Edition Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Rehab™ Tea + Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Rehab™ Rojo Tea + Energy Technology® Killer B® · Monster Rehab™ Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Rehab™ Protean + Energy Technology® Black Ice™ · Monster Energy® M3™ Super Concentrate · X-Presso Monster® Hammer · X-Presso Monster® Midnite We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse (“Warehouse”), whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we introduced the following products: · Monster Rehab™ Tea + Lemonade + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (February 2011). · Peace Tea® “Caddy Shack”, a non-carbonated tea + lemonade drink (February 2011). · Monster Rehab™ Rojo Tea + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (October 2011). · Monster Rehab™ Green Tea + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (October 2011). · Monster Rehab™ Protean + Energy, a non-carbonated protein rehydration energy drink (October 2011). · Hubert’s® Half & Half, a line of premium ready-to-drink lemonade + teas (October 2011). · Angeleno™ Aguas Fresca, a line of premium ready-to-drink aguas frescas (December 2011). Our gross sales* of $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $1,788.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $446.7 million, or 96.7% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. 35 Table of Contents Our gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the “Advance Purchases”). We previously estimated that gross sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2009 were increased by approximately 4% to 6% as a result of the Advance Purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our DSD segment represented 94.4%, 93.0% and 91.4% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 5.6%, 7.0% and 8.6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to enhance demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $381.0 million, $240.6 million and $168.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such sales were approximately 20%, 16% and 13% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross sales to customers in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 87.5% higher than gross sales in EMEA for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the same customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors’ sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to such full service distributors without reference to such distributor’s sales to their own customers. 36 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Full service distributors 64% 64% 66% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 10% 12% 12% Outside the U.S. 20% 16% 13% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 4% 6% 6% Other 2% 2% 3% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes certain of our products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed certain of our products. Concurrently with this acquisition, New CCE was formed, which currently distributes certain of our products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden (Sweden was added during the first quarter of 2011). Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), the AB Distributors, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, SUPERVALU INC, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCR accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. CCE, which included their operations in the U.S. for the relevant periods (see distribution agreement (g) in “Item 1 – Business – Distribution Agreements”), accounted for approximately 28% and 27% our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional”, “image based” and/or “better for you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · International – The profitable introduction and development of our Monster Energy brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. 37 Table of Contents · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowings provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2012 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010”). As of December 31, 2011, the Company had working capital of $916.6 million compared to $769.3 million as of December 31, 2010. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $333.8 million as compared to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Principal uses of cash flows in 2011 were purchases of investments, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low carbohydrate beverages, juices and juice drinks, waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. 38 Table of Contents In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; · the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions; · increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; and · legislation that would limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy drinks can be sold and/or impose taxation of the sale of energy drinks. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · growth potential of other segments of the “alternative” beverage category including sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink iced teas, juice drinks and enhanced waters; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of premium packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; · launching our products into new geographic markets; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share information) Percentage Change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,950,490 $ 1,488,516 $ 1,309,335 31.0% 13.7% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 247,260 184,574 166,036 34.0% 11.2% Net sales¹ 1,703,230 1,303,942 1,143,299 30.6% 14.1% Cost of sales 808,921 623,702 530,983 29.7% 17.5% Gross profit*** 894,309 680,240 612,316 31.5% 11.1% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.5% 52.2% 53.6% Operating expenses 437,886 332,426 275,007 31.7% 20.9% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 25.7% 25.5% 24.1% Operating income 456,423 347,814 337,309 31.2% 3.1% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 26.8% 26.7% 29.5% Other income (expense): Interest and other income, net 1,619 2,246 2,273 (27.9% ) (1.2% ) Loss on investments and put option, net (772 ) (758 ) (3,887 ) 1.8% (80.5% ) Total other income (expense) 847 1,488 (1,614 ) Income before provision for income taxes 457,270 349,302 335,695 30.9% 4.1% Provision for income taxes 171,051 137,273 126,979 24.6% 8.1% Net income $ 286,219 $ 212,029 $ 208,716 35.0% 1.6% Net income as a percentage of net sales 16.8% 16.3% 18.3% Net income per common share¹: Basic $1.62 $1.20 $1.16 35.6% 3.3% Diluted $1.53 $1.14 $1.10 34.5% 3.4% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 164,661 129,031 109,985 27.6% 17.3% ¹Stock Split - On January 11, 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock (the “stock split”) to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The stock dividend was issued on February 15, 2012. Net income per common share has been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split. (See “Part II, Item 8, Note 1” in our consolidated financial statements). *Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross 40 Table of Contents sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See “Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $462.0 million, or 31.0% higher than gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $446.7 million, or 96.7%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances were $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $62.7 million, or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $399.3 million, or 30.6% higher than net sales of $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 95.2%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately 35.6 million cases or 27.6% higher than case sales of 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was 2.4% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the average net sales per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products, primarily our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. 41 Table of Contents Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $395.7 million, or 32.6% higher than net sales of $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 96.0%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $3.6 million, or 4.0% higher than net sales of $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $214.1 million, or 31.5% higher than the gross profit of $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $446.7 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $437.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $105.5 million, or 31.7% higher than total operating expenses of $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $14.3 million, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $13.9 million, increased expenditures of $13.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $13.0 million for advertising, increased expenditures of $12.3 million for allocated trade development, increased expenditures of $10.5 million for commissions, increased expenditures for promotional items of $7.1 million, increased expenditures of $6.5 million for merchandise displays, increased expenditures of $3.6 million for samples and increased expenditures of $10.7 million for other operating expenses.

Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $543.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $106.5 million, or 24.4% higher than the contribution margin of $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $380.0 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $5.1 million higher than the contribution margin of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances and lower selling expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $108.6 million, or 31.2% higher than operating income of $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 26.8% and 26.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million, partially offset by a $105.5 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in relation to our new and existing markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America. 42 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 million from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $33.8 million or 24.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 37.4% from 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. Net Income. Net income was $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $74.2 million or 35.0% higher than net income of $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $105.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $33.8 million.

Gross profit was $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $67.9 million, or 11.1% higher than the gross profit of $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $162.1 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to production variances and increased costs of goods including the costs of raw materials in the DSD and Warehouse segments as well as product mix and geographic mix. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $57.4 million, or 20.9% higher than total operating expenses of $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $15.0 million (of which $2.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation) and increased expenditures of $13.4 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Expenditures for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs and SAP implementation costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $21.5 million as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the 2009 comparative period included a $4.7 million credit related to reimbursements to the Company of legal expenses previously paid by the Company). In addition, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $11.2 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $6.2 million for point-of-sale materials, increased expenditures of $4.5 million for allocated trade development, increased depreciation expense of $1.6 million and increased expenditures of $2.2 million for other operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $1.6 million related to the costs associated with distributor terminations, decreased expenditures of $1.7 million for advertising, decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for samples and decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for commissions. 44 Table of Contents Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $45.0 million, or 11.5% higher than contribution margin of $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Operating Income. Operating income was $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 3.1% higher than operating income of $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million, partially offset by a $57.4 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negatively affected by operating losses of $9.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in relation to our operations in Europe, Australia and Brazil. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.1 million from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.3 million or 8.1% higher than the provision for income taxes of $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective combined federal and state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.3% from 37.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2010, lower state tax benefits and the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits that arose in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in tax rates was partially offset by the increase in tax benefits resulting from the Domestic Production Deduction. The effect of the valuation allowance and its related impact on the Company’s overall tax rate increased the provision for income taxes by $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net Income. Net income was $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.3 million or 1.6% higher than net income of $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million and an increase in other income (expense) of $3.1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2010 cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, additions to intangibles and purchases of property and equipment. For both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities also included acquisitions of real property. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. 46 Table of Contents Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities – Net cash used in financing activities was $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011 cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $176.4 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011 cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $20.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $23.5 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds of $20.8 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $12.4 million excess tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – At December 31, 2011, we had $359.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $434.5 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. A large portion of these auction rate securities carry an investment grade credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. Since 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able exercise the Put Options (as defined below), or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, these securities, except those that we intend to sell prior to December 31, 2012 as a result of the agreements described below, or those that were redeemed at par after December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In June 2011, we entered into an agreement (the “2011 ARS Agreement”) related to $24.5 million of par value auction rate securities (the “2011 ARS Securities”). Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the right to sell the 2011 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the “2011 Put Option”) as follows: (i) on or after July 1, 2013, up to $1.0 million aggregate par value; (ii) on or after October 1, 2013, up to an additional $1.0 million aggregate par value; and (iii) in quarterly installments thereafter based on a formula of the then outstanding 2011 ARS Securities, as adjusted for normal market redemptions, with full sale rights available on or after April 1, 2016. The 2011 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2011 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2011 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the obligation, 47 Table of Contents should we receive written notification from the put issuer, to sell the 2011 ARS Securities at par plus all accrued but unpaid interest. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $3.7 million of par value 2011 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. In March 2010, we entered into an agreement (the “2010 ARS Agreement”) related to $54.2 million of par value auction rate securities (the “2010 ARS Securities”). Under the 2010 ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the 2010 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the “2010 Put Option”) as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) equal semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The 2010 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2010 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2010 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $27.1 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 Put Option and $4.0 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels ($7.4 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels during the year ended December 31, 2010). At December 31, 2011, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million (amortized cost basis of $35.9 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2011 resulting in a fair value of $3.3 million for our available-for-sale auction rate securities (after a $5.0 million impairment) and $32.5 million for our trading auction rate securities (after a $4.0 million impairment), which are included in short-term and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, as well as expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded $3.0 million in aggregate as the fair market value of the 2011 Put Option and the 2010 Put Option (collectively the “Put Options”). The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the 2011 Put Option during the second fiscal quarter of 2011; (ii) the revaluation of the Put Options as of December 31, 2011; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the 2011 ARS Securities during the second fiscal quarter of 2011; (iv) the revaluation of our trading auction rate securities as of September 30, 2011; (v) the redemption at par of certain 2011 ARS Securities and 2010 ARS Securities, including those redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 Put Option; and (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2011, resulted in a (loss) of ($0.8) million included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the 2010 Put Option during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (ii) the revaluation of the 2010 Put Option as of December 31, 2010; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the 2010 ARS Securities during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (iv) the revaluation of the Company’s trading auction rate securities as of December 31, 2010; (v) the redemption at par of certain 2010 ARS Securities; (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; and (vii) an increase in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities, resulted in a (loss) of ($0.8) million included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We hold additional auction rate securities that do not have a related put option. These auction rate securities continue to be classified as available-for-sale securities. We intend to retain our investment in these securities until the earlier of the anticipated recovery in market value or maturity. 48 Table of Contents Based on our ability to access cash and cash equivalents and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, or uncertainties in the expected performance of the issuers of the Put Options arise, or there are rating downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. The Company purchased 5.0 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $35.63 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, for a total amount of $176.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company purchased 1.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an average purchase price of $18.84 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, for a total amount of $23.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $40.0 million through December 31, 2012. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2011: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 95,082 $ 48,716 $ 46,366 $ - $ - Capital Leases 1,099 1,099 - - - Operating Leases 18,043 3,996 9,853 3,533 661 Purchase Commitments² 44,197 44,197 - - - $ 158,421 $ 98,008 $ 56,219 $ 3,533 $ 661 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. During October 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 75,425 square foot, free standing, three-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA for a purchase price of approximately $8.2 million. The purchase is subject to various conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to the closing. If the building is ultimately acquired by the Company, the Company intends to complete any necessary improvements thereon and occupy the building as the Company’s new corporate headquarters at some time in the future. In addition, approximately $1.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2011. We expect $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits will be settled within the next 12 months, and we are uncertain as to if or when the remaining amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2011. 49 Table of Contents Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 “Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 50 Table of Contents Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy® trademark, the Hansen’s® trademark, the Blue Sky® trademark, and the Junior Juice® trademark, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2011, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. 51 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes – We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. 52 Table of Contents We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may become more pronounced with the expansion of the distribution of our products outside of California. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”). 53 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Unit Case Volume / Case Sales (in Thousands) Quarter 1 34,681 24,205 23,468 22,274 19,396 Quarter 2 44,272 35,861 29,256 28,726 26,950 Quarter 3 46,277 37,856 29,800 28,009 26,450 Quarter 4 39,431 31,109 27,461 23,650 25,657 Total 164,661 129,031 109,985 102,659 98,453 Net Sales (in Thousands) Quarter 1 $ 356,419 $ 238,110 $ 244,206 $ 212,178 $ 165,853 Quarter 2 462,145 365,701 300,250 282,244 244,763 Quarter 3 474,709 381,466 307,929 284,986 247,211 Quarter 4 409,957 318,665 290,914 254,372 ¹ 246,638 Total $ 1,703,230 $ 1,303,942 $ 1,143,299 $ 1,033,780 ¹ $ 904,465 Average Net Sales Per Case Quarter 1 $ 10.28 $ 9.84 $ 10.41 $ 9.53 $ 8.55 Quarter 2 10.44 10.20 10.26 9.83 9.08 Quarter 3 10.26 10.08 10.33 10.17 9.35 Quarter 4 10.40 10.24 10.59 10.76 ¹ 9.61 Total $ 10.34 $ 10.11 $ 10.40 $ 10.07 ¹ $ 9.19 ¹Net Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 included the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Average net sales per case exclusive of this recognition were $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended) regarding our expectations with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 54 Table of Contents Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: · The current uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy; · The impact of lower disposable incomes of our consumers, as a result of the current state of the economy, the continuing high levels of unemployment and high gasoline prices; · The impact of the acquisition of CCE’s North American business by TCCC; · Disruption in distribution or sales and/or decline in sales due to the termination and/or appointment of existing and/or new domestic and/or international distributors; · The impact of the acquisition of AB by InBev;

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 20% and 16% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2011 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2011 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2011, we had $359.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $434.5 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, municipal securities, U.S. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities. 57 Table of Contents In June 2011, we entered into the 2011 ARS Agreement, related to $24.5 million of par value auction rate securities. Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the right to sell the 2011 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after July 1, 2013, up to $1.0 million aggregate par value; (ii) on or after October 1, 2013, up to an additional $1.0 million aggregate par value; and (iii) in quarterly installments thereafter based on a formula of the then outstanding 2011 ARS securities, as adjusted for normal market redemptions, with full sale rights available on or after April 1, 2016. The 2011 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2011 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2011 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the obligation, should we receive written notification from the put issuer, to sell the 2011 ARS Securities at par including all accrued but unpaid interest. In March 2010, we entered into the 2010 ARS Agreement, related to $54.2 million of par value auction rate securities. Under the 2010 ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the 2010 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) equal semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The 2010 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2010 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the 2010 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $4.0 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels ($7.4 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels during the year ended December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, $27.1 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 Put Option. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $3.7 million of par value 2011 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. The applicable interest rate on our auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. Since 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. There is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored to redeem these instruments, the related Put Options become exercisable, or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value.",2023-12-30 21:14:12.750316
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Hansen’s® · Monster Rehab® · Hansen’s Natural Cane Soda® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Junior Juice® · Java Monster® · Blue Sky® · X-Presso Monster® · Hubert’s® · Worx Energy® · Vidration® · Peace Tea® Our Monster Energy® drinks, which represented 92.3%, 91.2% and 89.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Energy® Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® 36 Table of Contents · Monster Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Monster M-80® (named Ripper® in certain countries) · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Monster MIXXD® · Java Monster® Toffee · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero · Monster Energy® Import · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Super Dry™ · Monster Energy® Import Light · Monster Energy® Dub Edition Baller’s Blend · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Energy® Dub Edition Mad Dog · Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Black Ice™ · Monster Rehab® Rojo Tea + Energy · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · X-Presso Monster® Hammer · X-Presso Monster® Midnite · Monster Rehab® Protean + Energy · Monster Cuba-Lima® · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · Monster Energy® Zero Ultra · M3® Monster Energy® Super Concentrate · Übermonster® Energy Brew We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse (“Warehouse”), whose principal products comprise juice-based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we introduced the following products: · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy, a non-carbonated energy drink with electrolytes (February 2012). · Übermonster® Energy Brew, a non-alcoholic energy drink, manufactured using a brewed fermentation process (February 2012). · Hansen’s® Coconut Water, in original and tropical flavors, packaged in re-sealable Tetra Prisma boxes (March 2012). · Peace Tea® Cranberry, Pink Lemonade and Texas-Style Sweet Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas (March 2012). · Monster Energy® Zero Ultra, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (August 2012). · Monster Cuba-Lima®, a carbonated lime flavored non-alcoholic energy drink (September 2012). · Monster Energy® “Dub Edition” Baller’s Blend, a carbonated punch + energy drink (October 2012). · Monster Energy® “Dub Edition” Mad Dog, a carbonated punch + energy drink (October 2012). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2012, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our gross sales* of $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $2,205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $416.3 million, or 98.4% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. 37 Table of Contents Our gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the “Advance Purchases”). We previously estimated that gross sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2009 were increased by approximately 4% to 6% as a result of the Advance Purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our DSD segment represented 95.4%, 94.4% and 93.0% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 4.6%, 5.6% and 7.0% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to enhance demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We have historically marketed our Monster Energy®, Hansen’s Energy® and Blue Energy® energy drink products as dietary supplements in accordance with the statutory definition of “dietary supplement” set forth in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, as permitted under that Act and FDA regulations, we recently decided to transition the labeling and marketing of these energy drink products from dietary supplements to conventional foods. It is anticipated that new labels for such products as conventional foods will be introduced in 2013. Products marketed under the Worx Energy® brand, which are sold in 2-ounce bottles, will continue to be labeled as dietary supplements. We do not expect the cost of the labeling changes to be significant. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $513.9 million, $381.0 million and $240.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such sales were approximately 22%, 20% and 16% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to such full service distributors without reference to such distributors’ sales to their own customers. 2012 2011 2010 Full service distributors 63% 64% 64% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 9% 10% 12% Outside the U.S. 22% 20% 16% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 4% 4% 6% Other 2% 2% 2% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes certain of our products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed certain of our products. Concurrently with this acquisition, New CCE was formed, which currently distributes certain of our products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden. Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), the AB Distributors, New CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCR accounted for approximately 28% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. CCE, which included their operations in the U.S. for the relevant periods (see distribution agreement (d) in “Item 1 – Business – Distribution Agreements”), accounted for approximately 28% our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. 39 Table of Contents Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowings provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2013 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011”). As of December 31, 2012, the Company had working capital of $546.5 million compared to $916.6 million as of December 31, 2011. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the $737.1 million repurchase of the Company’s common stock during the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $287.7 million as compared to $333.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Principal uses of cash flows in 2012 were repurchases of our common stock, purchases of investments, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company. Legislation has been proposed at the U.S. state and/or municipal level and 40 Table of Contents proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have recently been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations. Decreased consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages, juices and juice drinks, waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”) Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · increasing concern over caffeine consumption and related regulation of our products containing caffeine; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; and changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, and co-packing availability; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, or imposing excise taxes limiting product size. 41 Table of Contents See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.

The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, 43 Table of Contents gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See “Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $423.0 million, or 21.7% higher than gross sales of $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $416.3 million, or 98.4%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote above, were $312.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $65.5 million, or 26.5% higher than promotional and other allowances of $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 13.2% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a result of the increase in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,060.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $357.5 million, or 21.0% higher than net sales of $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented 44 Table of Contents approximately $348.5 million, or 97.5%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 202.9 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately 38.3 million cases or 23.2% higher than case sales of 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $10.16 for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was 1.8% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The lower overall average net sales per case was primarily due to increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, product and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,966.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $358.2 million, or 22.3% higher than net sales of $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $348.5 million, or 97.3%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of approximately $0.7 million, or 0.7% lower than net sales of $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Hansen’s® sodas. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hubert’s® lemonades. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,065.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $171.3 million, or 19.2% higher than the gross profit of $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from 52.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $416.3 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product and geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales as well as production variances and product damages primarily in connection with Europe and Asia. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $77.1 million, or 17.6% higher than total operating expenses of $437.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $23.4 million (of which $9.0 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $17.9 million, increased expenditures of $11.1 million for allocated trade development, increased expenditures of $6.4 million for 45 Table of Contents marketing fees and increased expenditures of $4.2 million for merchandise displays. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $9.6 million for advertising, decreased expenditures of $8.0 million for commissions and royalties paid to non-customers and $4.1 million of insurance reimbursements related to legal fees incurred in prior periods. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $660.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $117.4 million, or 21.6% higher than contribution margin of $543.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $416.3 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately $0.8 million lower than contribution margin of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating Income. Operating income was $550.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $94.2 million, or 20.6% higher than operating income of $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $171.3 million, partially offset by a $77.1 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $10.1 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other (Expense) Income. Other (expense) income was ($1.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to other (expense) income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 38.1% from 37.4% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit, the establishment of full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as a higher effective combined state tax rate. Net Income. Net income was $340.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $53.8 million or 18.8% higher than net income of $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $171.3 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $77.1 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $38.1 million.

Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $5.1 million higher than the contribution margin of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances and lower selling expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $108.6 million, or 31.2% higher than operating income of $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 26.8% and 26.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million, partially offset by a $105.5 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in relation to our new and existing markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America. Other (Expense) Income. Other (expense) income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 million from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 37.4% from 39.3% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. Net Income. Net income was $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $74.2 million or 35.0% higher than net income of $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, customers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $287.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $333.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $340.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.4 million of stock-based compensation, $20.5 million of depreciation and other amortization and a $1.1 million loss on put options. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $14.2 million increase in income taxes payable, a $6.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable, a $2.7 million increase in accrued promotional allowances and a $2.5 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $47.6 million increase in inventory, a $33.2 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $19.7 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $17.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $5.7 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.5 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $1.9 million gain on investments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $286.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $19.4 million of stock-based compensation and $17.0 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $28.4 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $26.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $13.9 million increase in income taxes payable, a $9.5 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $8.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $2.9 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $56.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $6.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $6.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $4.5 million increase in inventory and a $3.8 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities – Net cash provided by investing activities was $271.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment, including the purchase of real property, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. 50 Table of Contents Cash flows used in financing activities – Net cash used in financing activities was $699.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $727.7 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $11.0 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $19.7 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $176.4 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $20.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $3.8 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2012, we had $222.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.4 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $50.0 million through December 31, 2013. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2012: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 100,512 $ 50,995 $ 49,517 $ - $ - Capital Leases 534 534 - - - Operating Leases 15,578 4,173 9,967 1,111 327 Purchase Commitments² 53,217 53,217 - - - $ 169,841 $ 108,919 $ 59,484 $ 1,111 $ 327 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. 51 Table of Contents In addition, approximately $0.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2012. The recognized tax benefits decreased by $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 mainly due to the completion of certain tax audits. We are uncertain as to if or when the remaining amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2012. In March 2012, the Company acquired an approximately 75,425 square foot, free standing, three-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA (the “March 2012 Property”), which we have not occupied, for a purchase price of $9.7 million. In October 2012, the Company acquired an approximately 141,000 square foot, free standing, six-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA (the “October 2012 Property”) adjacent to the March 2012 Property, for a purchase price of $18.8 million. The Company intends to complete the necessary improvements to the October 2012 Property and occupy the building as the Company’s new corporate headquarters at some time in the future. The October 2012 Property should more effectively address the future growth needs of the Company, compared to the March 2012 Property. In December 2012, the Company commenced marketing efforts to sell the March 2012 Property. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 “Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any 52 Table of Contents remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2012 or 2011. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. 53 Table of Contents Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy® and ® trademarks, the Monster Rehab® trademark, the Hansen’s® trademark, the Blue Sky® trademark, and the Junior Juice® trademark, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2012, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales are determined after deducting promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, which is generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment costs, insurance costs, postage costs, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. 54 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date on which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date on which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes – We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. 58 Table of Contents Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 22% and 20% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2012 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates as of December 31, 2012 to be significant. As of December 31, 2012, we had $222.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.4 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.",2023-12-30 21:14:18.519787
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Hansen’s® · Monster Rehab® · Hansen’s Natural Cane Soda® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Junior Juice® · Java Monster® · Blue Sky® · X-Presso Monster® · Hubert’s® · Muscle Monster® · Worx Energy® · Punch Monster™ · Peace Tea® 36 Table of Contents Our Monster Energy® drinks, which represented 92.5%, 92.3% and 91.2% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Monster Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Monster M-80® (named Ripper® in certain countries) · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero · Java Monster® Toffee · Monster Energy® Import · Java Monster® Kona Cappuccino™ · Monster Energy® Import Light · Punch Monster™ Baller’s Blend (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Super Dry™ · Punch Monster™ Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Rehab® Rojo Tea + Energy · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Black Ice™ · Monster Rehab® Protean + Energy · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · X-Presso Monster® Hammer · X-Presso Monster® Midnite · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy · Monster Cuba-Lima® · Muscle Monster® Vanilla · Monster Energy® Zero Ultra · Muscle Monster® Chocolate · Monster Energy® Ultra Blue · Muscle Monster® Coffee · Monster Energy® Ultra Red · Muscle Monster® Strawberry · M3® Monster Energy® Super Concentrate · Muscle Monster® Peanut Butter Cup · Übermonster® Energy Brew We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse (“Warehouse”), whose principal products comprise juice-based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we introduced the following products: · Monster Mini’s™, 12-packs in 8-ounce size cans (January 2013). · Muscle Monster® Energy Shakes, non-carbonated energy shakes with 25-grams of protein in five flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee (March 2013), Strawberry (November 2013) and Peanut Butter Cup (December 2013). · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy (March 2013). · Monster Energy® Ultra Blue, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (March 2013). · Java Monster® Kona Cappuccino™ (March 2013). · Hansen’s® Sparkling Fruit Beverages, a line of 10-calorie beverages with all natural sweeteners (March 2013). · Peace Tea® Georgia Peach and Sno-Berry, ready-to-drink iced teas (June 2013). · Hubert’s® Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Blackberry Lemonade and Cherry Limeade in 40-ounce glass bottles (July 2013). · Monster Energy® Ultra Red, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (September 2013). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2013, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 37 Table of Contents Our gross sales of $2,586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $2,412.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $207.4 million, or 97.4% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. The percentage increase in gross sales was 9.0%, 21.7% and 31.0% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We believe the decrease in the percentage growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to less robust growth of our Monster Energy® drink line in our United States and European energy drink markets. In addition, the growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was positively impacted by sales in Japan, which began in the second quarter of 2012 and therefore did not have a 2011 comparable. Our DSD segment represented 95.6%, 95.4% and 94.4% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 4.4%, 4.6% and 5.6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to enhance demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We have historically marketed our Monster Energy®, Hansen’s® and Blue Energy® energy drink products as dietary supplements in accordance with the statutory definition of “dietary supplement” set forth in the FFDC Act. However, as permitted under the FFDC Act and FDA regulations, we decided to transition the labeling and marketing of these energy drink products from dietary supplements to conventional foods. In the first quarter of 2013, we began transitioning the labeling of such products. Products marketed under the Worx Energy® brand, which are sold in 2-ounce bottles, will continue to be labeled as dietary supplements. The costs of the labeling changes have not been significant and we do not expect the remaining costs, if any, to be significant. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $580.6 million, $513.9 million and $381.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Such sales were approximately 23%, 22% and 20% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to such full service distributors without reference to such distributors’ sales to their own customers. 2013 2012 2011 Full service distributors 63% 63% 64% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 9% 9% 10% Outside the U.S. 23% 22% 20% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 3% 4% 4% Other 2% 2% 2% Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), the AB Distributors, New CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCR accounted for approximately 29%, 28% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provide a competitive advantage. 39 Table of Contents We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2014 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012”). As of December 31, 2013, the Company had working capital of $867.0 million compared to $546.5 million as of December 31, 2012. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in a combined overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $342.0 million as compared to $287.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Principal uses of cash flows in 2013 were purchases of investments, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment (including the Company’s new corporate office) and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company. Legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations. Decreased consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages, juices and juice drinks, waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages 40 Table of Contents and be competitive in the areas of quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · increasing concern over caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally and possible related regulation of our products containing caffeine; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; and changes in government regulations; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can and co-packing availability; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · growth potential of other segments of the “alternative” beverage category including sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink iced teas, juice drinks and protein drinks; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of premium packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; · launching our products into new geographic markets; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share information) Percentage Change 2013 2012 2011 13 vs. 12 12 vs. 11 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 2,586,531 $ 2,373,499 $ 1,950,490 9.0% 21.7% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 340,103 312,797 247,260 8.7% 26.5% Net sales 2,246,428 2,060,702 1,703,230 9.0% 21.0% Cost of sales 1,073,497 995,046 808,921 7.9% 23.0% Gross profit*** 1,172,931 1,065,656 894,309 10.1% 19.2% Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 52.2% 51.7% 52.5% Operating expenses 600,015 515,033 437,886 16.5% 17.6% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 26.7% 25.0% 25.7% Operating income 572,916 550,623 456,423 4.0% 20.6% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 25.5% 26.7% 26.8% Other (expense) income: Interest and other (expense) income, net (11,737) (2,256) 1,619 420.3% (239.3%) Gain (loss) on investments and put option, net 2,715 787 (772) 245.0% (201.9%) Total other (expense) income (9,022) (1,469) 847 Income before provision for income taxes 563,894 549,154 457,270 2.7% 20.1% Provision for income taxes 225,233 209,134 171,051 7.7% 22.3% Net income $ 338,661 $ 340,020 $ 286,219 (0.4%) 18.8% Net income as a percentage of net sales 15.1% 16.5% 16.8% Net income per common share: Basic $2.03 $1.96 $1.62 3.8% 20.5% Diluted $1.95 $1.86 $1.53 5.2% 21.1% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 221,348 202,918 164,661 9.1% 23.2% *Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See “Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). 42 Table of Contents ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $2,586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $213.0 million, or 9.0% higher than gross sales of $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $207.4 million, or 97.4%, of the overall increase in gross sales.

Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. 43 Table of Contents Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 221.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately 18.4 million cases or 9.1% higher than case sales of 202.9 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2012. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $10.15 for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was 0.1% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.16 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales for the DSD segment were $2,147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $180.9 million, or 9.2% higher than net sales of $1,966.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $177.5 million, or 98.1%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $4.9 million, or 5.1% higher than net sales of $94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Hubert’s® lemonades. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Hansen’s® soda. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,172.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $107.3 million, or 10.1% higher than the gross profit of $1,065.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $207.4 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix as well as a reduction in the cost of certain containers. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $85.0 million, or 16.5% higher than total operating expenses of $515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $19.4 million for professional service costs, including legal and accounting fees (of which $15.9 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks), increased payroll expenses of $13.7 million (of which $0.4 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $11.9 million, increased expenditures of $9.3 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors, increased expenditures of $7.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $5.2 million for merchandise displays. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $726.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $66.2 million, or 10.0% higher than the contribution margin of $660.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $207.4 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was 44 Table of Contents ($1.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately $5.2 million lower than the contribution margin of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased promotional and other allowances as well as increased operating expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $572.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $22.3 million, or 4.0% higher than operating income of $550.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating income dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $107.3 million, partially offset by an $85.0 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $12.9 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other (Expense) Income. Other (expense) was ($9.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to other (expense) of ($1.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Foreign currency transaction losses were $12.9 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to our operations in Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa. Interest income was $1.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $16.1 million or 7.7% higher than the provision for income taxes of $209.1 million for year ended December 31, 2012. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.9% from 38.1% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily the result of the impact of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. Net Income. Net income was $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $1.4 million or 0.4% lower than net income of $340.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in net income was partially attributable to: (i) an increase in professional service costs of $15.9 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks; (ii) an increase in expenditures attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $9.3 million; (iii) an increase in foreign currency losses of $9.2 million primarily related to our operations in Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa; and (iv) an increase in the effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate from 38.1% to 39.9% due in part to a $4.7 million increase in the impact of both existing and newly established valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $423.0 million, or 21.7% higher than gross sales of $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $416.3 million, or 98.4%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year 45 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2012. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote above, were $312.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $65.5 million, or 26.5% higher than promotional and other allowances of $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 13.2% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a result of the increase in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,060.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $357.5 million, or 21.0% higher than net sales of $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 202.9 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately 38.3 million cases or 23.2% higher than case sales of 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $10.16 for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was 1.8% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The lower overall average net sales per case was primarily due to increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, product and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,966.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $358.2 million, or 22.3% higher than net sales of $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Hansen’s® sodas. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hubert’s® lemonades. 46 Table of Contents Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,065.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $171.3 million, or 19.2% higher than the gross profit of $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, customers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a 49 Table of Contents portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. Cash flows used in financing activities – Net cash used in financing activities was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $699.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $30.3 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and $21.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $67.6 million of re-purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $727.7 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $11.0 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $19.7 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2013, we had $211.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $412.0 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $100.0 million through December 31, 2014. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. 50 Table of Contents The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2013: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 93,940 $ 60,241 $ 33,199 $ 500 $ - Capital Leases 1,287 1,287 - - - Operating Leases 17,374 5,050 9,165 1,582 1,577 Purchase Commitments² 44,459 44,459 - - - $ 157,060 $ 111,037 $ 42,364 $ 2,082 $ 1,577 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In addition, approximately $0.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2013. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2013. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 “Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our 51 Table of Contents investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2013 or 2012. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. 52 Table of Contents Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Unleash the Beast®, Punch Monster™, Peace Tea®, Hansen’s®, Blue Sky®, and the Junior Juice® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2013, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales are determined after deducting promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expense and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, which is generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. 53 Table of Contents Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment costs, insurance costs, postage costs, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date on which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date on which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes – We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 23% and 22% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2013 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates as of December 31, 2013 to be significant. As of December 31, 2013, we had $211.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $412.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.",2023-12-30 21:14:14.675786

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Acquisitions and Divestitures On August 14, 2014, the Company and TCCC entered into definitive agreements for the TCCC Transaction. Pursuant to the TCCC Transaction Agreements, the Company will reorganize into a new holding company by merging Merger Sub into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of NewCo. In the merger, each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock will be converted into one share of NewCo’s common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the TCCC Transaction Agreements, upon the closing of the TCCC Transaction, (1) NewCo will issue to TCCC newly issued shares of common stock representing approximately 16.7% of the total number of shares of issued and outstanding NewCo common stock (after giving effect to the new issuance) and TCCC will have the right to nominate two individuals (reduced to one upon the earlier of (i) 36 months after the closing of the TCCC Transaction and (ii) TCCC’s equity interest in NewCo exceeding 20% of the outstanding shares of NewCo common stock) to NewCo’s Board of Directors, (2) TCCC will transfer its global energy drink business (including the NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Play® and Power Play®, and Relentless® brands) to 41 Table of Contents NewCo, and the Company will transfer its non-energy drink business (including Hansen’s® Natural Sodas, Peace Tea®, Hubert’s® Lemonade and Hansen’s® Juice Products) to TCCC, (3) the Company and TCCC will amend their current distribution coordination agreements, which will contemplate expanding distribution of the Company’s products into additional territories pursuant to long-term distribution agreements with TCCC’s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling and distribution partners, and (4) TCCC will make a net cash payment of $2.15 billion to the Company (up to $625.0 million of which will be held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of distribution rights). The waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the TCCC Transaction expired on October 15, 2014, and all necessary approvals or consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Hansen’s® · Monster Rehab® · Hansen’s Natural Cane Soda® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Junior Juice® · Java Monster® · Blue Sky® · Muscle Monster® · Hubert’s® · Punch Monster® · Peace Tea® Our Monster Energy® drinks, which represented 93.3%, 92.5% and 92.3% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Juice Monster™ Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Juice Monster™ Ripper® · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero · Java Monster® Cappuccino · · Monster Energy® Import Punch Monster® Baller’s Blend (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Super Dry™ · · Punch Monster® Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Rehab® Rojo Tea + Energy · Monster Cuba-Lima® · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy® Zero Ultra · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · Monster Energy® Ultra Blue™ · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy® Ultra Red™ · Muscle Monster® Vanilla · Monster Energy® Ultra Black™ · Muscle Monster® Chocolate · Monster Energy® Ultra Sunrise™ · Muscle Monster® Coffee · Monster Energy® Unleaded · Muscle Monster® Strawberry · Übermonster® Energy Brew™ · Muscle Monster® Peanut Butter Cup · M3® Monster Energy® Super Concentrate · Monster Energy® Valentino Rossi 42 Table of Contents We have two operating and reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), the principal products of which comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse (“Warehouse”), the principal products of which comprise juice-based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Following the consummation of the TCCC Transaction, the Company anticipates that it will have two operating and reporting segments: Concentrate, the principal products of which will likely include the various energy drink brands transferred to the Company from TCCC, and Finished Products, the principal products of which will likely include the Company’s Monster Energy® drink products that currently make up the majority of the DSD segment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we introduced the following products: · Punch Monster® Baller’s Blend (formerly Dub Edition) (January 2014). · Punch Monster® Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) (January 2014). · Peace Tea Beverage Company™ Viva Mango™, a mango flavored juice drink (February 2014). · Monster Energy® Valentino Rossi, a carbonated energy drink (May 2014). · Hubert’s® Organic Lemonade, a line of certified organic lemonades in a variety of flavors (May 2014). · Monster Energy® Ultra Black™, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar, launched as a summer promotion with 7-eleven (July 2014). · Monster Energy® Unleaded, a carbonated energy drink which contains no caffeine (August 2014). · Monster Energy® Ultra Sunrise™, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (September 2014). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2014, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our gross sales of $2,827.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $2,649.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $236.9 million, or 98.5% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. Our DSD segment represented 96.1%, 95.6% and 95.4% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 3.9%, 4.4% and 4.6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, 43 Table of Contents personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We have historically marketed our Monster Energy®, Hansen’s® and Blue Energy® energy drink products as dietary supplements in accordance with the statutory definition of “dietary supplement” set forth in the FFDC Act. However, as permitted under the FFDC Act and FDA regulations, we transitioned the labeling and marketing of these energy drink products from dietary supplements to conventional foods beginning in the first quarter of 2013. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $657.9 million, $580.6 million and $513.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Such sales were approximately 23%, 23% and 22% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military.

In February 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, the Company sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the U.S. for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights will be transitioned to TCCC’s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling and distribution partners as of the effective date of termination of the AB Distributors’ rights in the applicable territories (see Note 8 “Distribution Agreements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). CCR accounted for approximately 29%, 29% and 28% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 44 Table of Contents We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. The TCCC Transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to TCCC’s leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. In addition, we anticipate that the TCCC Transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a strong presence in additional countries. · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks, including through the addition of TCCC’s existing energy product lines in connection with the TCCC Transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provide a competitive advantage. Furthermore, it is anticipated that, following the TCCC Transaction, we will have a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, and we expect that a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents will be used to return capital to our shareholders pursuant to share repurchases, which could be effected pursuant to a self-tender offer, accelerated share repurchase or otherwise, alone or potentially in conjunction with dividend payments. The timing, terms and amount of any such share repurchase will be determined by the NewCo board of directors. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2015 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013”). 45 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014, the Company had working capital of $1,337.7 million compared to $867.0 million as of December 31, 2013. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in a combined overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $585.6 million as compared to $342.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Principal uses of cash flows in 2014 were purchases of investments, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company, including, following the completion of the TCCC Transaction, those relating to the transition of the distribution of our products to TCCC’s distribution network, our significant commercial relationships with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of NewCo, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. state and/or county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. 46 Table of Contents In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · the risks associated with consummation of, and the realization of benefits from, the TCCC Transaction, including the transition of the distribution of our products to TCCC’s distribution network; · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · increasing concern over various health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in related government regulations; and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes and related labor issues; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can and co-packing availability; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · domestic and international growth potential of our products due to our transition to a leading global distribution network and the scale and platform synergies expected in connection with the TCCC Transaction; · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of premium packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; · launching our products into new geographic markets; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share information) Percentage Change 2014 2013 2012 14 vs. 13 13 vs. 12 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 2,827,092 $ 2,586,531 $ 2,373,499 9.3% 9.0% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 362,225 340,103 312,797 6.5% 8.7% Net sales 2,464,867 2,246,428 2,060,702 9.7% 9.0% Cost of sales 1,125,057 1,073,497 995,046 4.8% 7.9% Gross profit*** 1,339,810 1,172,931 1,065,656 14.2% 10.1% Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 54.4% 52.2% 51.7% Operating expenses 592,305 600,015 515,033 (1.3%) 16.5% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 24.0% 26.7% 25.0% Operating income 747,505 572,916 550,623 30.5% 4.0% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 30.3% 25.5% 26.7% Other (expense) income: Interest and other (expense) income, net (1,676) (11,737) (2,256) (85.7%) 420.3% (Loss) gain on investments and put option, net (41) 2,715 787 (101.5%) 245.0% Total other (expense) income (1,717) (9,022) (1,469) Income before provision for income taxes 745,788 563,894 549,154 32.3% 2.7% Provision for income taxes 262,603 225,233 209,134 16.6% 7.7% Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes 35.2% 39.9% 38.1% Net income $ 483,185 $ 338,661 $ 340,020 42.7% (0.4%) Net income as a percentage of net sales 19.6% 15.1% 16.5% Net income per common share: Basic $2.89 $2.03 $1.96 42.2% 3.8% Diluted $2.77 $1.95 $1.86 41.9% 5.2% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 238,280 221,348 202,918 7.6% 9.1% *Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in 48 Table of Contents place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See “Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $2,827.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $240.6 million, or 9.3% higher than gross sales of $2,586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $236.9 million, or 98.5%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea® line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote above, were $362.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $22.1 million, or 6.5% higher than promotional and other allowances of $340.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.8% from 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was higher than the percentage increase in gross sales. Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,464.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $218.4 million, or 9.7% higher than net sales of $2,246.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $220.4 million, or 100.9%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea® line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. 49 Table of Contents Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 238.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately 16.9 million cases or 7.6% higher than case sales of 221.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2013. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was 1.9% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.15 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales for the DSD segment were $2,369.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $221.9 million, or 10.3% higher than net sales of $2,147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $220.4 million, or 99.4%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea® line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $3.4 million, or 3.4% lower than net sales of $99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of Hubert’s® lemonades and apple juice. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of aseptic juices. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $166.9 million, or 14.2% higher than the gross profit of $1,172.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $236.9 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea® line, changes in product sales mix, lower costs of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $592.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $7.7 million, or 1.3% lower than total operating expenses of $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $10.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors, decreased expenditures of $9.9 million for premiums, decreased expenditures of $8.6 million for allocated trade development, a $2.5 million non-routine indirect tax related provision recorded in the third quarter of 2013, subsequently reversed in the second quarter of 2014 for non-realization, and decreased expenditures of $4.0 million for point-of-sale materials. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $7.2 million, increased expenditures of $6.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $6.4 million (inclusive of decreased stock-based compensation of $0.2 million), increased expenditures of $2.7 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and expenditures of $4.8 million for professional service costs related to the TCCC Transaction. 50 Table of Contents Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $908.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $182.0 million, or 25.0% higher than contribution margin of $726.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $236.9 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $4.7 million higher than contribution loss of ($1.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating Income. Operating income was $747.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $174.6 million, or 30.5% higher than operating income of $572.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales as well as the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to an increase of $166.9 million in gross profit. Operating income (loss) was $37.8 million and ($12.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other (Expense) Income. Other (expense) income was ($1.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to other (expense) income of ($9.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The decrease in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Japan, Ireland and South Africa. Interest income was $1.7 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $37.4 million or 16.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 35.2% from 39.9% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related income tax expense, as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. Net Income. Net income was $483.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $144.5 million or 42.7% higher than net income of $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $166.9 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes of $37.4 million.

Gross profit was $1,172.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $107.3 million, or 10.1% higher than the gross profit of $1,065.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $207.4 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix as well as a reduction in the cost of certain containers. 52 Table of Contents Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $85.0 million, or 16.5% higher than total operating expenses of $515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $19.4 million for professional service costs, including legal and accounting fees (of which $15.9 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks), increased payroll expenses of $13.7 million (of which $0.4 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $11.9 million, increased expenditures of $9.3 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors, increased expenditures of $7.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $5.2 million for merchandise displays. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $726.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $66.2 million, or 10.0% higher than the contribution margin of $660.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $207.4 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was ($1.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately $5.2 million lower than the contribution margin of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased promotional and other allowances as well as increased operating expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $572.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $22.3 million, or 4.0% higher than operating income of $550.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating income dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $107.3 million, partially offset by an $85.0 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $12.9 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other (Expense) Income. Other (expense) was ($9.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to other (expense) of ($1.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Foreign currency transaction losses were $12.9 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to our operations in Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa. Interest income was $1.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $16.1 million or 7.7% higher than the provision for income taxes of $209.1 million for year ended December 31, 2012. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.9% from 38.1% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily the result of the impact of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. 53 Table of Contents Net Income. Net income was $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $1.4 million or 0.4% lower than net income of $340.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in net income was partially attributable to: (i) an increase in professional service costs of $15.9 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks; (ii) an increase in expenditures attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $9.3 million; (iii) an increase in foreign currency losses of $9.2 million primarily related to our operations in Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa; and (iv) an increase in the effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate from 38.1% to 39.9% due in part to a $4.7 million increase in the impact of both existing and newly established valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $585.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $342.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $483.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.6 million of stock-based compensation and $25.7 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $42.8 million decrease in inventory, a $20.5 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $11.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $8.4 million increase in income taxes payable, a $4.6 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $3.4 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.0 million increase in accrued liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $14.3 million increase in accounts receivable, an $11.9 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $9.8 million increase in deferred income taxes, an $8.1 million decrease in deferred revenue and a $2.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $338.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.8 million of stock-based compensation and $22.7 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $34.3 million increase in income taxes payable, a $24.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $8.9 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $3.0 million increase in deferred revenue, a $2.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.0 million increase in accrued compensation and a $1.6 million increase in accrued distributor terminations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $43.0 million increase in accounts receivable, a $30.3 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $21.6 million increase in inventory, a $7.1 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $8.2 million decrease in accounts payable, a $4.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $7.4 million increase in distributor receivables, and a $3.6 million gain on investments. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $440.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity and available for sale investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment (including the Company’s new corporate offices), and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of trading investments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. For both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a 55 Table of Contents portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities – Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $17.2 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and an $11.9 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $8.2 million of re-purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $30.3 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and $21.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $67.6 million of re-purchases of common stock. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring uses of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2014, we had $370.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $824.1 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Of our $370.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2014, $117.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2014. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. Under current tax laws, if funds in excess of intercompany amounts owed were repatriated to our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay additional income taxes on such excess funds at the tax rates then in effect. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $120.0 million through December 31, 2015. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. 56 Table of Contents The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2014: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 77,981 $ 46,290 $ 28,898 $ 2,793 $ - Capital Leases 467 467 - - - Operating Leases 12,973 5,310 5,507 990 1,166 Purchase Commitments² 31,253 31,253 - - - $ 122,674 $ 83,320 $ 34,405 $ 3,783 $ 1,166 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In addition, approximately $0.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2014. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2014. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments – Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 “Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis 57 Table of Contents and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2014 or 2013. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that 58 Table of Contents recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles – Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Unleash the Beast®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster™, Peace Tea®, Hansen’s®, Blue Sky®, and the Junior Juice® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2014, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition – We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales are determined after deducting promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expense and actual expenses for promotional and other allowances have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, which is generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. 59 Table of Contents Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment costs, insurance costs, postage costs, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date on which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date on which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes – We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 60 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended) regarding our expectations with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not 63 Table of Contents rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 23% of consolidated gross sales for both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2014 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 to be significant. As of December 31, 2014, we had $370.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $824.1 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.",2023-12-30 21:14:18.201251
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Acquisitions and Divestitures On June 12, 2015, Old Monster, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreements entered into with TCCC on August 14, 2014, which provided for the TCCC Transaction. Also, on June 12, 2015, Old Monster effected the Holding Company Reorganization, and the Company changed its name from New Laser Corporation to “Monster Beverage Corporation.” In the Holding Company Reorganization, each Old Monster common share, par value $0.005 per share, outstanding immediately prior to consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization (other than any Old Monster common shares owned by Old Monster immediately prior to the closing of the TCCC Transaction, which were cancelled) was converted automatically into the right to receive one Company common share, par value $0.005 per share. In addition, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization: · each unexercised and unexpired stock option then outstanding under any equity compensation plan of Old Monster, whether or not then exercisable, ceased to represent a right to acquire Old Monster common shares and was converted automatically into a right to acquire the same number of Company common shares, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Old Monster stock option; and 38 Table of Contents · each share of restricted stock and each restricted stock unit of Old Monster granted under all outstanding equity compensation plans ceased to represent or relate to Old Monster common shares and was converted automatically to represent or relate to Company common shares, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Old Monster restricted stock and restricted stock units (including the vesting or other lapse restrictions (without acceleration thereof by virtue of the Holding Company Reorganization and the TCCC Transaction)). Promptly following the effective time of the Holding Company Reorganization, Old Monster assigned to the Company all obligations of Old Monster under Old Monster’s equity compensation plans and each stock option agreement, restricted stock award agreement, restricted stock unit award agreement and any similar agreement entered into pursuant to such equity compensation plans. In addition, all obligations of Old Monster under any employment agreements and indemnification agreements were assigned to the Company. Immediately after the effective time of the Holding Company Reorganization, (1) the Company issued to TCCC the New Issuance and TCCC appointed two individuals to the Company’s Board of Directors, (2) TCCC transferred all of its rights in and to KO Energy to the Company, (3) Old Monster transferred all of its rights in and to Monster Non-Energy to TCCC, (4) the Company and TCCC amended the distribution coordination agreements previously existing between them to govern the transition of third parties’ rights to distribute the Company’s energy products in most territories in the U.S. to members of TCCC’s distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors, and (5) TCCC and one of its subsidiaries made an aggregate net cash payment to the Company of $2.15 billion, $125.0 million of which is currently held in escrow as described below pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, subject to release upon the achievement of milestones relating to the transition of distribution rights to TCCC’s distribution network. On the one-year anniversary of the closing of the TCCC Transaction, the then-remaining escrow amount, less an amount sufficient to cover any unresolved claims, will be released to TCCC. Any amount described above that becomes payable following the one-year anniversary will be paid directly from TCCC to the Company. As of February 29, 2016, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 89% of the target case sales have been transitioned to TCCC’s distribution network. As a result, $125 million is currently held in escrow. The Company expects to transition sufficient additional distribution rights to result in the release of all remaining amounts held in escrow. Therefore, the Company believes that achievement of the milestones is probable. In accordance with ASC No. 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, the Company expenses distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. As a result, the Company incurred termination amounts of $224.0 million, ($0.2) million and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to distribution rights transferred. Such termination amounts have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, the Company recognized as income $39.8 million in the first quarter of 2015, related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the first quarter of 2015. The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2015 2014 2013 Included in Net Sales: Accelerated recognition of deferred revenue $ 39,761 $ - $ - Included in Operating Expenses: Distributor termination costs 224,000 (157) 10,754 TCCC Transaction expenses 15,496 4,824 - Gain on sale of Monster Non-Energy 161,470 - - Net Impact on Operating Income $ (38,265) $ (4,667) $ (10,754) 39 Table of Contents Overview We develop, market sell and distribute energy drink beverages and/or concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Nalu® · Monster Rehab® · NOS® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Full Throttle® · Java Monster® · Burn® · Muscle Monster® · Mother® · Mega Monster Energy® · Ultra® · Punch Monster® · Play® and Power Play® · Juice Monster® · Gladiator® · M3® · Relentless® · Übermonster® · Samurai® · BU® · BPM® Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which represented 92.5%, 93.9% and 93.2% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Juice Monster® Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Juice Monster® Ripper® · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Juice Monster® Pipeline Punch™ · Java Monster® Cappuccino · Monster Energy® Absolutely Zero · Mega Monster Energy® · Monster Energy® Import · Punch Monster® Baller’s Blend® (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Super Dry™ · Punch Monster® Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Rehab® Raspberry Tea + Energy (formerly Rojo) · M3® Monster Energy® Super Concentrate · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy® Zero Ultra · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · Monster Energy® Ultra Blue™ · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy® Ultra Red™ · Monster Rehab® Peach Tea + Energy · Monster Energy® Ultra Black™ · Muscle Monster® Vanilla · Monster Energy® Ultra Sunrise® · Muscle Monster® Chocolate · Monster Energy® Ultra Citron™ · Muscle Monster® Strawberry · Muscle Monster® Banana · Monster Ghost™ M-100™ · Monster Phantom™ M-100™ · Monster Energy® Unleaded® · Übermonster® Energy Brew™ · Monster Energy® Valentino Rossi 40 Table of Contents We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Finished Products, (ii) Concentrate and (iii) Other, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea® brand). During 2015, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio and further develop our distribution markets. During 2015, we introduced the following Monster Energy® brand energy drink products, in addition to the Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction: · Monster Energy® Ultra Citron™, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (January 2015). · Monster Rehab® Peach Tea + Energy (January 2015). · Juice Monster® Pipeline Punch™ (July 2015). · Muscle Monster® Banana (July 2015). · Monster Ghost™ M-100™, an exclusive limited time listing with a convenience customer (July 2015). · Monster Phantom™ M-100™, an exclusive limited time listing with certain convenience customers (July 2015). · Monster Rehab® Raspberry Tea + Energy (August 2015). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2015 (other than those disposed of as part of the TCCC Transaction), either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our net sales of $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 represented record annual net sales. The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $204.0 million, or 79.2% of our overall increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Any decrease in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. Net sales of our Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We are currently evaluating our future strategy for the positioning of our Strategic Brands. 41 Table of Contents We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $713.2 million, $657.9 million and $580.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such sales were approximately 23% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the United States of approximately 14%, 1% and 2% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such distributors’ sales to their own customers. 2015 2014 2013 U.S. full service bottlers/distributors 65% 62% 63% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 9% 9% 9% International full service bottlers/distributors 23% 23% 23% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 2% 4% 3% Other 1% 2% 2% Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Swire Coca-Cola, USA and certain other Coca-Cola independent bottlers, Asahi, Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Costco and AB Distributors. In February 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, the Company sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the United States for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights have been transitioned to TCCC’s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors as of the effective date of termination of the AB Distributors’ rights in the applicable territories (see Note 9 “Distribution Agreements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). The TCCC Subsidiaries accounted for approximately 42%, 29% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 42 Table of Contents We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. The TCCC Transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to TCCC’s leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. In addition, we anticipate that the TCCC Transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a strong presence in additional countries. · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we have expanded our energy drinks, including through the addition of TCCC’s existing energy product lines in connection with the TCCC Transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on building upon the respective profit margins for both the Finished Products segment and the Concentrate segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. Furthermore, following the TCCC Transaction, we have a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, and we expect that a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents will be used to return capital to our shareholders pursuant to share repurchases, which may be effected pursuant to open market transactions, a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer, accelerated share repurchase, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, terms and amount of any such share repurchase will be determined by the Company’s board of directors. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2016 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014”). As of December 31, 2015, the Company had working capital of $3,068.4 million compared to $1,297.4 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of cash received in the TCCC Transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $208.0 million as compared to $585.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Principal uses of cash flows in 2015 were purchases of investments, share repurchases, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company, including our significant commercial relationships with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. state and/or county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. 44 Table of Contents In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · the risks associated with the realization of benefits from the TCCC Transaction, including the transition of the distribution of our products to TCCC’s distribution network; · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · increasing concern over various health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in related government regulations; and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes and related labor issues; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can and co-packing availability; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · domestic and international growth potential of our products due to our transition to a leading global distribution network and the scale and platform synergies expected in connection with the TCCC Transaction; · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of premium and/or new packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; · redesign, repackaging and repositioning of our Strategic Brands; · significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; · launching our products into new geographic markets such as China; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth key statistics for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $257.7 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $2,464.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $204.0 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015 (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea® brand), decreased $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $39.8 million related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 274.6 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately 36.3 million cases or 15.3% higher than case sales of 238.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2014. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $9.91 for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was 4.2% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The lower average net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the Concentrate segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than those products within the Finished Products segment. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $204.0 million, or 8.8% higher than net sales of $2,314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). There were no net sales for the Concentrate segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea® brand), were $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from January 1, 2015 to June 12, 2015), a decrease of approximately $89.6 million, or 59.6% lower than net sales of $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,632.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $292.5 million, or 21.8% higher than the gross profit of $1,339.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross 47 Table of Contents profit dollars was primarily the result of the $204.0 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, the $143.3 million of net sales for the Concentrate segment as well as the $39.8 million accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Concentrate segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the decrease in the net sales of the Other segment, which generally has lower gross margins than the Finished Products segment, and the $39.8 million accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors, as well as due to changes in product sales mix and lower costs of certain sweeteners and other raw materials. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $900.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $307.8 million, or 52.0% higher than total operating expenses of $592.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs of $224.2 million associated with terminating certain existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased payroll expenses of $30.0 million (of which $11.9 million was related to payroll taxes in connection with the exercise of certain stock options), increased expenditures of $16.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $10.7 million for transaction expenses related to the TCCC Transaction. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was $836.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately $68.1 million, or 7.5% lower than contribution margin of $904.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was primarily the result of the increased expenditures of $224.2 million relating to the costs associated with terminating certain existing distributors. Contribution margin for the Concentrate segment was $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no contribution margin for the Concentrate segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. Contribution margin for the Other segment was $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from January 1 to June 12), as compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in contribution margin for the Other segment was primarily the result of the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy. Operating Income. Operating income was $893.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $146.1 million, or 19.6% higher than operating income of $747.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the $292.5 million increase in gross profit as well as the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy. The increase in operating income in dollars was offset by increased costs of $224.2 million associated with terminating certain existing distributors as well as the increase in other operating expenses. Operating income was $51.5 million and $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Expense, net. Other expense, net was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to other expense, net of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Foreign currency transaction losses were $5.5 million and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest income was $3.1 million and $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $344.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $82.2 million or 31.3% higher than the provision for income taxes of $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 38.7% from 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the disallowance for tax purposes of certain 48 Table of Contents costs related to the TCCC Transaction, the decrease in tax benefits relating to the domestic production deduction and the establishment of valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the profits, or a portion thereof, earned in certain foreign subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2014 had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by the release of the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions. Net Income. Net income was $546.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $63.5 million or 13.2% higher than net income of $483.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,464.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $218.4 million, or 9.7% higher than net sales of $2,246.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $220.1 million, or 100.9%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our former Peace Tea® line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 238.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately 16.9 million cases or 7.6% higher than case sales of 221.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2013. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was 1.9% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.15 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were $2,314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $220.1 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $2,094.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea® brand), were $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $1.7 million, or 1.1% lower than net sales of $152.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $166.9 million, or 14.2% higher than the gross profit of $1,172.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $220.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, price increases on our 24-ounce 49 Table of Contents Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our former Peace Tea® line, changes in product sales mix, lower costs of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies.

Total operating expenses were $592.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $7.7 million, or 1.3% lower than total operating expenses of $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $10.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors, decreased expenditures of $9.9 million for premiums, decreased expenditures of $8.6 million for allocated trade development, a $2.5 million non-routine indirect tax related provision recorded in the third quarter of 2013, subsequently reversed in the second quarter of 2014 for non-realization, and decreased expenditures of $4.0 million for point-of-sale materials. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $7.2 million, increased expenditures of $6.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $6.4 million (inclusive of decreased stock-based compensation of $0.2 million), increased expenditures of $2.7 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and expenditures of $4.8 million for professional service costs related to the TCCC Transaction. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was $904.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $175.9 million, or 24.2% higher than contribution margin of $728.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was primarily the result of the $241.1 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Other segment was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $10.7 million higher than contribution loss of ($3.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2013. There was no contribution margin for the Concentrate segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Operating Income. Operating income was $747.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $174.6 million, or 30.5% higher than operating income of $572.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales as well as the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to an increase of $166.9 million in gross profit. Operating income (loss) was $37.8 million and ($12.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Expense, net. Other expense, net was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to other expense, net of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Foreign currency transaction losses were $3.4 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Japan, Ireland and South Africa. Interest income was $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $37.4 million or 16.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes of $37.4 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Gross sales**. Gross sales were $3,105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $278.6 million, or 9.9% higher than gross sales of $2,827.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $222.1 million, or 79.7%, of the overall increase in gross sales.

Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $156.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015 (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea® brand), decreased $99.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014.

Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.3% from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Gross Sales**. Gross sales were $2,827.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $240.6 million, or 9.3% higher than gross sales of $2,586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $241.1 million, or 100.2%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our former Peace Tea® line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

As a result, the percentage increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was higher than the percentage increase in gross sales. 51 Table of Contents Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. **Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.

Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottler’s/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates as if converted into finished products, sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our 52 Table of Contents energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $585.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. 53 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $546.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $32.7 million of stock-based compensation and $30.9 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $415.4 million increase in income taxes payable, a $20.9 million increase in accounts payable, a $43.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.0 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $11.2 million increase in accrued distributor terminations, a $5.9 million decrease in prepaid income taxes and a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in operating activities was due to a $314.7 million excess tax benefit from stock option exercises, a $302.4 million change in deferred income taxes, a $77.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $38.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $7.1 million increase in inventories, and a $9.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $483.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.6 million of stock-based compensation and $25.7 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $42.8 million decrease in inventory, a $20.5 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $11.3 million increase in accounts payable, an $8.4 million increase in income taxes payable, a $4.6 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $3.4 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.0 million increase in accrued liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $14.3 million increase in accounts receivable, an $11.9 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $9.8 million increase in deferred income taxes, an $8.1 million decrease in deferred revenue and a $2.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations. Cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $400.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to cash used of $440.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments and to purchases of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities included $198.0 million from the sale of Monster Non-Energy and $179.7 million from the transfer of distribution rights pursuant to the TCCC Transaction. For both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash provided by investing activities was also attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. Cash flows provided by financing activities. We generated $1,202.3 million of cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $19.3 million for the year 54 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,202.3 million was primarily the result of the issuance of our common stock to TCCC during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the TCCC Transaction. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property and coolers), leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments — As of December 31, 2015, we had $2,175.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $760.0 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Of our $2,175.4 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2015, $174.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. Under current tax laws, if funds in excess of intercompany amounts owed were repatriated to our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay additional income taxes on such excess funds at the tax rates then in effect. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be approximately $2.8 billion through December 31, 2016, including the completion of our purchase of American Fruits and Flavors as well as additional share repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors on February 24, 2016 (see Note 20 “Subsequent Events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements). However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. 55 Table of Contents The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2015: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 111,615 $ 67,356 $ 44,199 $ 60 $ - Capital Leases 811 811 - - - Operating Leases 10,725 7,202 1,945 838 740 Purchase Commitments² 40,794 40,794 - - - $ 163,945 $ 116,163 $ 46,144 $ 898 $ 740 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In addition, approximately $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2015. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future. Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in 56 Table of Contents the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis. Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value). Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income. Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses 57 Table of Contents qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Unleash the Beast®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Mega Monster Energy®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, M3®, Ubermonster®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra®, Play® and Power Play®, Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairments recorded. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 58 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company’s finished products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are co-packed on the Company’s behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. Revenue for the Concentrate Segment is generally recognized when title to the concentrate is transferred to the customer. In particular, title to the concentrate usually passes upon shipment to the customers’ locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for the anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expense and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the 59 Table of Contents availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2015 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 63 Table of Contents We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 to be significant. As of December 31, 2015, we had $2,175.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $760.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.",2023-12-30 21:14:18.567755

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Stock Repurchases On April 28, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized us to commence a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the “Auction Stock Repurchase Tender”). The Auction Stock Repurchase Tender was authorized under our existing share repurchase authority and was funded with cash on hand. We commenced this tender offer in May 2016. On June 15, 2016, we accepted for payment an aggregate of 38.5 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $52.00 per share, for a total amount of $2.0 billion (excluding commissions). Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. We incurred $1.6 million in stock repurchase expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender. On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the “August 2016 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased 5.8 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $43.40 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the August 2016 Repurchase Plan. Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. 37 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of AFF, in an asset acquisition that brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, we purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments. We accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with FASB ASC No. 805 “Business Combinations”. Inventory purchased under the AFF Transaction was recorded at fair value. Raw material cost savings from the AFF Transaction were approximately $46.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. However, raw material cost savings were not immediately recognized upon the completion of the AFF Transaction as both the Company’s inventory on hand and inventory acquired as part of the AFF Transaction were recorded at fair value. As a result, the cost savings were not recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the second quarter of 2016. We incurred $4.5 million in AFF Transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. On June 12, 2015, we completed the TCCC Transaction which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category with TCCC. As part of the TCCC Transaction, we transitioned certain distribution rights to TCCC’s distribution network. In accordance with FASB ASC No. 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, we expense distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. We incurred distributor termination costs of $79.8 million, $224.0 million and ($0.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. We recognized as income $5.7 million and $39.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the relevant periods. No accelerated amortization of deferred revenue was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014. We incurred $15.5 million and $4.8 million in TCCC Transaction related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incurred no TCCC Transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Factors Impacting Profitability The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: 38 Table of Contents Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2016 2015 2014 Included in Net Sales: Accelerated recognition of deferred revenue $ 5,713 $ 39,761 $ - Included in Operating Expenses: Stock Repurchase expenses $ (1,556) $ - $ - AFF Transaction expenses (4,483) - - Distributor termination costs (79,751) (224,000) 157 TCCC Transaction expenses - (15,496) (4,824) Gain on sale of Monster Non-Energy $ - $ 161,470 $ - Net Impact on Operating Income $ (80,077) $ (38,265) $ (4,667) Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages, sodas and/or concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Nalu® · Monster Rehab® · NOS® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Full Throttle® · Java Monster® · Burn® · Muscle Monster® · Mother® · Mega Monster Energy® · Ultra® · Punch Monster® · Play® and Power Play® · Juice Monster® · Gladiator® · Übermonster® · Relentless® · BU® · Samurai® · Mutant® Super Soda · BPM® Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which represented 90.1%, 92.5% and 93.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily include the following: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Juice Monster® Khaos® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Juice Monster® Ripper® · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Juice Monster® Pipeline Punch® · Java Monster® Salted Caramel · Monster Energy Absolutely Zero® · Mega Monster Energy® · Monster Energy® Import · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Punch Monster® Baller’s Blend® (formerly Dub Edition) Technology® Super Dry™ · Punch Monster® Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Monster Rehab® Raspberry Tea + Energy (formerly Rojo) · M3® Monster Energy® Super Concentrate · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Zero Ultra® · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Blue® · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Red® 39 Table of Contents · Monster Rehab® Peach Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Black® · Muscle Monster® Vanilla · Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise® · Muscle Monster® Chocolate · Monster Energy Ultra Citron® · Muscle Monster® Strawberry · Monster Energy Ultra Violet™ · Muscle Monster® Banana · Monster Energy® Valentino Rossi · Monster Energy® Gronk · Übermonster® Energy Brew™ We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment which is comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC as a result of the TCCC Transaction and (iii) Other segment (“Other”), the principal products of which include the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction as well as the AFF Third-Party Products. During 2016, we continued to expand our existing portfolio of drinks and further develop our distribution markets. During 2016, we introduced the following products: · Monster Energy Ultra Violet™ (December 2016). · Mutant® Super Soda (September 2016). · Monster Energy® Gronk (February 2016). · Java Monster® Salted Caramel (January 2016). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2016, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our net sales of $3,049.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented record annual net sales. The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $2,747.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $229.4 million, or 70.2% of our overall increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Any decrease in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. Net sales of our Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction were $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and South Africa, partially offset by our operations in Japan. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $888.7 million, $713.2 million and $657.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such sales were approximately 25%, 23% and 23% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the United States of approximately 3%, 14% and 1% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and South Africa, partially offset by our operations in Japan. 40 Table of Contents Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers. 2016 2015 2014 U.S. full service bottlers/distributors 65% 65% 62% Club stores and mass merchandisers 8% 9% 9% International full service bottlers/distributors 25% 23% 23% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 1% 2% 4% Other 1% 1% 2% Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola group in China, COFCO Coca-Cola group in China, Asahi, Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Costco and select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the “AB Distributors”). In February 2015, in accordance with our then existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, we sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the United States for the termination of their respective distribution agreements. The associated distribution rights relating to such terminated distribution agreements have been transitioned to TCCC’s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors as of the effective date of termination of the affected AB Distributors’ rights in the applicable territories. As of March 1, 2017, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 94% of the target case sales have been transitioned to TCCC’s distribution network. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. TCCC, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately 41%, 43% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. The TCCC Transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to TCCC’s leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. In addition, we anticipate that the TCCC Transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a strong presence in additional countries for our Monster Energy® drinks brand. 41 Table of Contents · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of products. In particular, we have expanded our range of energy drinks, including through the addition of TCCC’s existing energy product lines in connection with the TCCC Transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2017 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015”). As of December 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $961.7 million compared to $3,189.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the $2.0 billion Auction Stock Repurchase Tender and the AFF Transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $701.4 million as compared to $522.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Principal uses of cash flows in 2016 (other than the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender and the AFF Transaction), were purchases of investments, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and acquisition of property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” 42 Table of Contents In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection.

Net Sales. Net sales were $3,049.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $326.8 million, or 12.0% higher than net sales of $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $229.4 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). There were no net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $60.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales of our AFF Third- Party Products were $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no net sales of our AFF Third-Party Products for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales included $5.7 million and $39.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and South Africa, partially offset by our operations in Japan. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 321.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 46.3 million cases or 16.9% higher than case sales of 274.6 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall average net sales per case (excluding AFF Third-Party Products’ net sales of $17.0 million, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.45 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was 4.7% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.91 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the Strategic Brands segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than products within the Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $2,759.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $241.4 million, or 9.6% higher than net sales of $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net sales for the Other segment were $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $43.8 million, or 72.0% lower than net sales of $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 are comprised of sales of the AFF Third-Party Products.

Gross profit was $1,942.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $309.7 million, or 19.0% higher than the gross profit of $1,632.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 60.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $229.4 million and $129.2 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Strategic Brands, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, (ii) no sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, (iii) lower costs of certain raw materials, (iv) the raw material cost savings resulting from the AFF Transaction and (v) changes in product sales mix.

The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was also due to decreased expenditures of $15.4 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the TCCC Transaction, decreased expenditures of $3.5 million for distribution costs and decreased expenditures of $3.5 million for advertising. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $29.5 million (of which $13.1 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $27.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.7 million for professional service costs (exclusive of expenditures related to the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender, the AFF Transaction and the TCCC Transaction), including legal and accounting fees, increased expenditures of $8.4 million for premiums, increased expenditures of $7.9 million for other marketing expenses, increased expenditures of $6.5 million for commissions, increased intangible asset amortization of $6.6 million and $6.0 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender and the AFF Transaction, respectively.

The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the $229.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was partially offset by the $39.8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to distributor terminations, as compared to $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Contribution margin for the Strategic Brands segment was $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $73.3 million, or 81.6% higher than contribution margin of $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015).

Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 32.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations, as well as the $309.7 million increase in gross profit. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 34.0% from 38.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the stock compensation deduction as well as the increase in the domestic production deduction taken in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the disallowance of a tax deduction for certain costs related to the TCCC Transaction and the release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a certain foreign jurisdiction in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net Income. Net income was $712.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $165.9 million or 30.4% higher than net income of $546.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Gross sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, decreased $99.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $39.8 million related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors, which represented 14.3% of our overall increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $383.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $20.9 million, or 5.8% higher than promotional and other allowances of $362.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Canada and South Africa. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our operations in Europe. **Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. 51 Table of Contents The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: In thousands Percentage Change Percentage Change 2016 2015 2014 16 vs. 15 15 vs. 14 Gross sales, net of discounts and returns $ 3,485,463 $ 3,105,665 $ 2,827,092 12.2% 9.9% Less: Promotional and other allowances*** 436,070 383,101 362,225 13.8% 5.8% Net Sales $ 3,049,393 $ 2,722,564 $ 2,464,867 12.0% 10.5% ***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottler’s/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were (i) to promote trial and increase sales volume, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $701.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $522.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $712.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $45.8 million of stock-based compensation and $40.8 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $45.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $20.9 million decrease in inventories, a $13.8 million increase in deferred revenue, an $8.1 million increase in accrued compensation and a $4.4 million increase in income taxes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was due to an $86.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $48.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $20.0 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.1 million change in deferred income taxes, a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $3.9 million decrease in accrued promotional allowances, a $3.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $2.9 million decrease in accrued liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $546.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $32.7 million of stock-based compensation and $30.9 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $311.5 million increase in income taxes payable, a $20.9 million increase in accounts payable, a $43.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.0 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $11.2 million increase in accrued distributor terminations and a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in operating activities was due to a $181.6 million change in deferred income taxes, a $77.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $38.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, an $11.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $7.1 million increase in inventories and a $9.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. 54 Table of Contents Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $256.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $400.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the purchase of AFF, purchases of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments and to purchases of property and equipment. For both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash provided by investing activities was attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments and sales of available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities included $198.0 million from the sale of Monster Non-Energy and $179.7 million from the transfer of distribution rights pursuant to the TCCC Transaction. For both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products), to develop our brand in international markets and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $2,238.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $887.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily the result of purchases of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property and coolers), leasehold improvements, construction of our new warehouse, build out of our recently purchased offices, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2016, we had $377.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $222.9 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 55 Table of Contents Of our $377.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2016, $207.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2016. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. Under current tax laws, if funds in excess of intercompany amounts owed were repatriated to our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay additional income taxes on such excess funds at the tax rates then in effect. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be approximately $200.0 million through December 31, 2017. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2016: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 163,273 $ 91,003 $ 57,390 $ 14,880 $ - Capital Leases 1,105 1,105 - - - Operating Leases 18,782 5,677 3,008 2,085 8,012 Purchase Commitments² 47,033 47,033 - - - $ 230,193 $ 144,818 $ 60,398 $ 16,965 $ 8,012 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In September 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of approximately 49 acres of land, located in Rialto, CA, for a purchase price of approximately $39.1 million. The Company has begun construction of an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building, which it hopes to have LEED certified, to replace its current leased warehouse and distribution facilities located in Corona, CA. The Company has entered into an approximately $36.8 million guaranteed maximum price construction contract for the construction of the building of which $33.7 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the recognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2016 are immaterial. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: 56 Table of Contents Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future. Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. 57 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis. Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value). Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income. Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 there were no impairments recorded. Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Unleash the Beast®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Mega Monster Energy®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, M3®, Ubermonster®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra®, Play® and Power Play®, Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition, as a result of the AFF Transaction, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 there were no impairments recorded. 58 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2016 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of, and title to, the Company’s finished products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are co-packed on the Company’s behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. Revenue for the Strategic Brands segment is generally recognized when title to the concentrate is transferred to the customer. In particular, title to the concentrate usually passes upon shipment to the customers’ locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with FASB ASC 605-50. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for the anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. 59 Table of Contents Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those 63 Table of Contents expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 25% and 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2016 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2016 to be significant. As of December 31, 2016, we had $377.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $222.9 million in short-term and long-term investments including U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. 64 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:14:18.562192

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Acquisitions and Divestitures On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner American Fruits & Flavors (“AFF”), in an asset acquisition that brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities (the “AFF Transaction”). Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, we purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments. (See Note 2 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). We incurred $4.5 million in AFF Transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. On June 12, 2015, we completed the TCCC Transaction which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category with TCCC. As part of the TCCC Transaction, we transitioned certain distribution rights to TCCC’s distribution network. 36 Table of Contents In accordance with FASB ASC No. 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, we expense distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. We incurred distributor termination costs of $35.4 million, $79.8 million and $224.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We recognized as income $0.6 million, $5.7 million and $39.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the relevant periods. We incurred $15.5 million in TCCC Transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. We incurred no TCCC Transaction related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Factors Impacting Profitability The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2017 2016 2015 Included in Net Sales: Accelerated recognition of deferred revenue $ 585 $ 5,713 $ 39,761 Included in Operating Expenses: Stock Repurchase expenses $ - $ (1,556) $ - AFF Transaction expenses - (4,483) - Distributor termination costs (35,410) (79,751) (224,000) TCCC Transaction expenses - - (15,496) Gain on sale of Monster Non-Energy $ - $ - $ 161,470 Net Impact on Operating Income $ (34,825) $ (80,077) $ (38,265) On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, we revalued our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, resulting in a provisional $39.8 million charge included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of Post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (“E&P”) through the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, we recognized a provisional $2.1 million charge in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the deemed mandatory repatriation. Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages, sodas and/or concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · NOS® · Monster Energy Ultra® · Full Throttle® · Monster Rehab® · Burn® · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology® · Mother® 37 Table of Contents · Java Monster® · Nalu® · Muscle Monster® · Ultra Energy® · Espresso MonsterTM · Play® and Power Play(stylized)® · Punch Monster® · Relentless® · Juice Monster® · BPM® · Übermonster® · BU® · Monster Hydro® · Gladiator® · Caffé MonsterTM · Samurai® · Mutant® Super Soda Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which represented 90.1%, 90.1% and 92.5% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily include the following energy drinks1: · Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Kona Blend · Lo-Carb Monster Energy® · Java Monster® Loca Moca® · Monster Assault® · Java Monster® Mean Bean® · Monster Energy Absolutely Zero® · Java Monster® Vanilla Light · Juice Monster® Khaos® · Java Monster® Irish Blend® · Juice Monster® Ripper® · Java Monster® Salted Caramel · Juice Monster® Pipeline Punch® · ÜbermonsterTM Energy BrewTM · Juice Monster® Mango Loco · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Monster Energy® Import Technology® Super Dry™ · Monster Energy® Export · Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous · Punch Monster® Baller’s Blend® (formerly Dub Edition) Technology® Anti-Gravity® · Punch Monster® Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) · M3(stylized) ® Monster Energy® Super · Monster Rehab® Tea + Lemonade + Energy Concentrate · Monster Rehab® Raspberry Tea + Energy (formerly Rojo) · Monster Energy Zero Ultra® · Monster Rehab® Green Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Blue® · Monster Rehab® Tea + Orangeade + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Red® · Monster Rehab® Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Black® · Monster Rehab® Peach Tea + Energy · Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise® · Muscle Monster® Vanilla · Monster Energy Ultra Citron® · Muscle Monster® Chocolate · Monster Energy Ultra Violet® · Monster Hydro® Mean Green® · Monster Energy® Valentino Rossi · Monster Hydro® Manic Melon® · Monster Energy® Lewis Hamilton 44 · Monster Hydro® Tropical Thunder® · Monster Energy® Gronk · Espresso MonsterTM Espresso and Cream · Monster Energy® Fury · Espresso MonsterTM Vanilla Espresso 1Discontinued products have been omitted. We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment which is comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC as a result of the TCCC Transaction and (iii) Other segment (“Other”), the principal products of which include the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction in June 2015, as well as the AFF Third-Party Products acquired as part of the AFF Transaction in April 2016. 38 Table of Contents During 2017, we continued to expand our existing portfolio of drinks and further develop our distribution markets. During 2017, we introduced the following products: · Espresso MonsterTM Espresso and Cream (October 2017) · Espresso MonsterTM Vanilla Espresso (October 2017) · NOS® Nitro Mango (October 2017) · Monster Energy® Fury (September 2017) · Monster Energy® Lewis Hamilton 44 (April 2017) · Mutant® Super Soda White Lightning (April 2017) · Monster Hydro® Mean Green® (May 2017) · Monster Hydro® Manic Melon® (May 2017) · Monster Hydro® Tropical Thunder® (May 2017) · Juice Monster® Mango Loco (May 2017) · Full Throttle® Orange (March 2017) Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we introduced Caffé MonsterTM Vanilla, Caffé MonsterTM Mocha and Caffé MonsterTM Salted Caramel. In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2017, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our net sales of $3,369.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 represented record annual net sales. The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $3,035.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $287.4 million, or 89.9% of our overall increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Any decrease in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. Net sales of our Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction were $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $1,094.8 million, $888.7 million and $713.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such sales were approximately 28%, 25% and 23% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the United States of approximately 1%, 3% and 14% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers. 39 Table of Contents 2017 2016 2015 U.S. full service bottlers/distributors 63% 65% 65% International full service bottlers/distributors 28% 25% 23% Club stores and mass merchandisers 7% 8% 9% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 1% 1% 2% Other 1% 1% 1% Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers (including CCBCC Operations, LLC), Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola group in China, COFCO Coca-Cola group in China, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, Coca-Cola Içecek Asahi Soft Drinks, Co., Ltd., Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Costco Wholesale Corporation, Big Geyser, Inc. and select AB Distributors. TCCC, through the TCCC Subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 18%, 41% and 43% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As part of the North America Refranchising, the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent/non wholly-owned TCCC bottler/distributors. Accordingly, our percentage of net sales classified as sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017. CCBCC Operations, LLC accounted for approximately 13%, 9% and 6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. The TCCC Transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to TCCC’s leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. In addition, we anticipate that the TCCC Transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a presence in additional countries for our Monster Energy® drinks brand. · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of products. In particular, we have expanded our range of energy drinks, including through the addition of TCCC’s existing energy product lines in connection with the TCCC Transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. 40 Table of Contents · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2017 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016”). As of December 31, 2017, the Company had working capital of $1,526.0 million compared to $961.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $987.7 million as compared to $701.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Principal uses of cash flows in 2017, were purchases of investments, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and acquisition of real property and other property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes 41 Table of Contents expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · the risks associated with the realization of benefits from the TCCC Transaction; · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image and product quality; · increasing concern over various health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · increase in costs of raw materials used by us; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes, related labor issues or other importation impediments; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the aluminum 24-ounce Cap-Can and PET cans; · limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. 42 Table of Contents We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · domestic and international growth potential of our products due to our continued transition to a leading global distribution network and the scale and platform synergies expected in connection with the TCCC Transaction; · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth; · package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; · launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new geographic markets; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth key statistics for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Net Sales. Net sales were $3,369.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $319.7 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $3,049.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $287.4 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 360.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 39.0 million cases or 12.2% higher than case sales of 321.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $21.6 million and $17.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.30 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was 1.6% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.45 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower average net sales price per case was primarily attributable to the changes in geographic sales mix. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3,047.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $287.7 million, or 10.4% higher than net sales of $2,759.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales for the Other segment were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2,137.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $195.7 million, or 10.1% higher than the gross profit of $1,942.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the AFF Transaction. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographical sales mix (our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins) and to certain increases in other costs, which were partially offset by raw material cost savings from the AFF Transaction and changes in domestic product sales mix. 45 Table of Contents Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $938.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $82.2 million, or 9.6% higher than total operating expenses of $856.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses of $40.5 million (of which $6.4 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $26.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.9 million for commissions, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $11.1 million, increased expenditures of $9.9 million for allocated trade development and increased expenditures of $8.3 million for merchandise displays. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the $44.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations and to decreased expenditures of $13.9 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1,264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $116.2 million, or 10.1% higher than contribution margin of $1,148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the AFF Transaction. Contribution margin for the Strategic Brands segment was $174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $11.3 million, or 7.0% higher than contribution margin of $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in contribution margin for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily due to an increase in net sales. Contribution margin for the Other segment was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $3.3 million, or 143.3% higher than contribution margin of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating Income. Operating income was $1,198.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $113.4 million, or 10.5% higher than operating income of $1,085.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 35.6% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Operating income was $139.3 million and $101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Income (Expense), net. Other non-operating income (expense), net, was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other non-operating income (expense), net of ($5.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Foreign currency transaction losses were $3.3 million and $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income, net was $5.9 million and $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $380.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.9 million, or 3.8% higher than the provision for income taxes of $367.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 31.7% from 34.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions relative to the United States as well as to the increase in equity compensation deductions, due in part to the increase in the related excess tax benefits recorded in net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of $39.8 million of tax expense related to the revaluation of the U.S. net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017, from 35% to the newly enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% due to the Tax Reform Act enacted on December 22, 2017. 46 Table of Contents Net Income. Net income was $820.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $108.0 million, or 15.2% higher than net income of $712.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to the $195.7 million increase in gross profit. The increase in net income was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of $82.2 million and the increase in the provision for income taxes of $13.9 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015. Net Sales. Net sales were $3,049.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $326.8 million, or 12.0% higher than net sales of $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $229.4 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). There were no net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $60.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales of our AFF Third- Party Products were $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no net sales of our AFF Third-Party Products for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales included $5.7 million and $39.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and South Africa, partially offset by our operations in Japan. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 321.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 46.3 million cases or 16.9% higher than case sales of 274.6 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall average net sales per case (excluding AFF Third-Party Products’ net sales of $17.0 million, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.45 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was 4.7% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.91 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the Strategic Brands segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than products within the Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $2,759.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $241.4 million, or 9.6% higher than net sales of $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. 47 Table of Contents Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $129.2 million, or 90.2% higher than net sales of $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). Net sales for the Other segment were $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $43.8 million, or 72.0% lower than net sales of $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 are comprised of sales of the AFF Third-Party Products. Net sales for the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 are comprised of sales of the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015 (effectively from January 1, 2015 to June 12, 2015). Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,942.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $309.7 million, or 19.0% higher than the gross profit of $1,632.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 60.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $229.4 million and $129.2 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Strategic Brands, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, (ii) no sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, (iii) lower costs of certain raw materials, (iv) the raw material cost savings resulting from the AFF Transaction and (v) changes in product sales mix. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $856.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $43.5 million, or 4.8% lower than total operating expenses of $900.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was also due to decreased expenditures of $15.4 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the TCCC Transaction, decreased expenditures of $3.5 million for distribution costs and decreased expenditures of $3.5 million for advertising. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $29.5 million (of which $13.1 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $27.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.7 million for professional service costs (exclusive of expenditures related to the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender, the AFF Transaction and the TCCC Transaction), including legal and accounting fees, increased expenditures of $8.4 million for premiums, increased expenditures of $7.9 million for other marketing expenses, increased expenditures of $6.5 million for commissions, increased intangible asset amortization of $6.6 million and $6.0 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender and the AFF Transaction, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1,148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $312.4 million, or 37.4% higher than contribution margin of $836.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the $229.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was partially offset by the $39.8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to distributor terminations, as compared to $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Contribution margin for the Strategic Brands segment was $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $73.3 million, or 81.6% higher than contribution margin of $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). 48 Table of Contents Contribution margin for the Other segment was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to contribution margin of $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in contribution margin for the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the $161.5 million gain on the sale of the rights in and to our non-energy business (“Monster Non-Energy”) to TCCC. Operating Income. Operating income was $1,085.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $191.7 million, or 21.4% higher than operating income of $893.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 32.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations, as well as the $309.7 million increase in gross profit. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was $101.7 million and $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Income (Expense), net. Other expense, net was ($5.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to other expense, net of ($2.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Foreign currency transaction losses were $9.7 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income, net was $4.0 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $367.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $22.2 million or 6.4% higher than the provision for income taxes of $344.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 34.0% from 38.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the stock compensation deduction as well as the increase in the domestic production deduction taken in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the disallowance of a tax deduction for certain costs related to the TCCC Transaction and the release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a certain foreign jurisdiction in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net Income. Net income was $712.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $165.9 million or 30.4% higher than net income of $546.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the increase in gross profit of $309.7 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as an increase in the provision for income taxes of $22.2 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Gross Sales**. Gross sales were $3,861.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $375.9 million, or 10.8% higher than gross sales of $3,485.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $345.1 million of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $318.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.8 million, or 8.1% higher than gross sales of $294.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.4 million, or 25.7% higher than gross sales of $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. 49 Table of Contents Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $492.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $56.3 million, or 12.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $436.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross sales**. Gross sales were $3,485.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $379.8 million, or 12.2% higher than gross sales of $3,105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $300.7 million of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $294.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $156.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). There were no gross sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in gross sales of $68.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Other segment. Gross sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no sales of our AFF Third-Party Products for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $436.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $53.0 million, or 13.8% higher than promotional and other allowances of $383.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and South Africa. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe. **Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. 50 Table of Contents The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: In thousands Percentage Change Percentage Change 2017 2016 2015 17 vs. 16 16 vs. 15 Gross sales, net of discounts and returns $ 3,861,368 $ 3,485,463 $ 3,105,665 10.8% 12.2% Less: Promotional and other allowances*** 492,323 436,070 383,101 12.9% 13.8% Net Sales $ 3,369,045 $ 3,049,393 $ 2,722,564 10.5% 12.0% ***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottler’s/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were (i) to promote trial and increase sales volume, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $987.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $701.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $820.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $52.3 million of stock-based compensation and $48.9 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $125.0 million decrease in the TCCC Transaction receivables, a $67.9 million decrease in deferred income taxes, a $29.6 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $11.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation and a $4.7 million decrease in distributor receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $71.3 million increase in prepaid income taxes, an $88.9 million increase in inventories, a $19.9 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $8.2 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $4.5 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $3.6 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $712.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $45.8 million of stock-based compensation and $40.8 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $45.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $20.9 million decrease in inventories, a $13.8 million increase in deferred revenue, an $8.1 million increase in accrued compensation and a $4.4 million increase in income taxes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was due to an $86.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $48.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $20.0 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.1 million change in deferred income taxes, a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $3.9 million decrease in accrued promotional allowances, a $3.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $2.9 million decrease in accrued liabilities. 53 Table of Contents Cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $531.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $256.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the purchase of AFF as well as purchases of held-to-maturity investments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, real property, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements and improvements to real property. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses. Cash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $2,238.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $675.3 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 54 Table of Contents Of our $528.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2017, $266.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017. Previously, amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were generally subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. However, the Tax Reform Act enacted in December 2017, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. We estimated that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $2.1 million, which was included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $2.1 million will be paid in installments over eight years. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. at any time with minimal U.S. income tax consequences, other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge and do not anticipate other material non-U.S. tax consequences resulting thereafter. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be approximately $100.0 million through December 31, 2018. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2017: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 155,871 $ 96,774 $ 53,423 $ 5,674 $ - Capital Leases 1,255 1,255 - - - Operating Leases 16,715 2,588 3,566 3,214 7,347 Purchase Commitments² 37,759 37,759 - - - $ 211,600 $ 138,376 $ 56,989 $ 8,888 $ 7,347 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 49 acres of land, located in Rialto, CA, for a purchase price of approximately $39.1 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the construction of an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building (the “Rialto Warehouse”) on this land, which we anticipate will be LEED certified, to replace our leased warehouse and distribution facilities located in Corona, CA. We entered into an approximately $38.1 million guaranteed maximum price construction contract for the construction of the building, of which $4.6 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2017. During the three-months ended September 30, 2017, we transitioned our Southern California warehouse and distribution operations to the Rialto Warehouse, which was fully operational by December 31, 2017. 55 Table of Contents In addition, $6.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2017. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. In addition, $1.3 million of potential penalties and interest have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2017. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future. Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair 56 Table of Contents value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis. Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value). Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income. Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 there were no impairments recorded. 57 Table of Contents Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Rehab®, Mutant®, Java Monster®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Hydro®, Espresso MonsterTM, Caffé MonsterTM, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, M3(stylized)®, Übermonster®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play(stylized)®, Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition, as a result of the AFF Transaction, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 there were no impairments recorded. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2017 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of, and title to, the Company’s finished products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are co-packed on the Company’s behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. 58 Table of Contents Revenue for the Strategic Brands segment is generally recognized when title to the concentrate is transferred to the customer. In particular, title to the concentrate usually passes upon shipment to the customers’ locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with FASB ASC 605-50. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for the anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks, including, but not limited to, clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. 59 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 28% and 25% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2017 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 63 Table of Contents We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 to be significant. As of December 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $675.3 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. I",2023-12-30 21:14:17.539363

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: · Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures; · Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; · Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; · Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; · Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; · Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; · Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and · Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: · Monster Energy® · Monster Energy Ultra® · Monster Rehab® · Monster MAXX® · Java Monster® · Muscle Monster® · Espresso Monster® · Punch Monster® · Juice Monster® · Monster Hydro® · Caffé Monster® · Predator® · Live+ · NOS® · Full Throttle® · Burn® · Mother® · Nalu® · Ultra Energy® · Play® and Power Play(stylized)® · Relentless® · BPM® · BU® · Gladiator® · Samurai® · Mutant® 37 Table of Contents Our net sales of $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented record annual net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $3.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $285.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $42.2 million as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to TCCC, based on sales to certain of the Company’s TCCC bottlers/distributors that TCCC consolidates, or to the TCCC Related Parties, are included as a reduction to net sales. Prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to the TCCC Related Parties, were included in operating expenses. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $1.36 billion, $1.09 billion and $888.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such sales were approximately 31%, 28% and 25% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers. 2018 2017 2016 U.S. full service bottlers/distributors 61% 63% 65% International full service bottlers/distributors 31% 28% 25% Club stores and mass merchandisers 6% 7% 8% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 1% 1% 1% Other 1% 1% 1% Our customers include Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Company (Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited from September 28, 2018), Coca-Cola Bottling Company, CCBCC Operations, LLC, United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC, Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, Great Lakes Coca-Cola Bottling, Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages LLC, Coca-Cola of Northern New England, Swire Coca-Cola, USA, Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages, Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, Coca-Cola İçecek and certain other TCCC network bottlers, Asahi Soft Drinks, Co., Ltd., Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Costco Wholesale Corporation and Big Geyser, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 38 Table of Contents TCCC, through certain consolidated subsidiaries (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately 3%, 18% and 41% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As part of TCCC’s North America Refranchising initiative (the “North America Refranchising”), the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent TCCC bottlers/distributors and/or TCCC Related Parties. Accordingly, our percentage of net sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries significantly decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018. CCBCC Operations, LLC accounted for approximately 13%, 13% and 9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling accounted for approximately 12%, 6% and 2% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10%, 9% and 9% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: · International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 155 countries and territories worldwide. · Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of products to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. · Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. · Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus. 39 Table of Contents We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2019 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017”). As of December 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $1.20 billion compared to $1.53 billion as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.34 billion of repurchases of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.16 billion as compared to $987.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Principal uses of cash flows in 2018, were purchases of investments, repurchase of our common stock, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and acquisitions of property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). 40 Table of Contents Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to: · the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC; · the relationship risks associated with the arbitration with TCCC; · the outcome of our arbitration proceedings with TCCC, including TCCC developing and distributing additional energy products; · changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; · economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; · the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation; · increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; · profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”); · costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; · increase in costs of raw materials used by us; · restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes, related labor issues or other importation impediments; · protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; · limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the aluminum 24-ounce Cap Can; · limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production; · the impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and · the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: · domestic and international growth potential of our products; · growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; · planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability; · the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth; · package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; · effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; · broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; 41 Table of Contents · launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels; and · continued focus on reducing our cost base.

We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Net Sales. Net sales were $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $438.1 million, or 13.0% higher than net sales of $3.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $42.2 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $450.8 million, or 14.8% higher than net sales of $3.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $17.4 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $285.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $14.0 million, or 4.7% lower than net sales of $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $24.9 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $1.3 million, or 6.1% higher than net sales of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 410.9 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately 50.9 million cases or 14.1% higher than case sales of 360.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2017. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $22.9 million and $21.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.21 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was 1.0% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.30 for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the overall average net sales per case increased to $9.31 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to average net sales per case of $9.30 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $157.7 million, or 7.4% higher than the gross profit of $2.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $455.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks for the year ended December 31, 2018. 43 Table of Contents Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 60.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 63.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of ASC 606, was 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) increases in certain input costs, principally aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; (ii) domestic product sales mix (iii) geographical sales mix, as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales (our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins); (iv) the $42.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; and (v) increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $72.9 million, or 7.8% higher than total operating expenses of $938.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $38.5 million, increased payroll expenses of $28.6 million (of which $4.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $14.8 million for sponsorships and endorsements, and increased expenditures of $12.1 million for other marketing expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the $8.8 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations. Commissions included in operating expenses were $16.7 million, or 65.1% lower than commissions included in operating expenses of $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, an additional $42.2 million of commissions would have been included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 (such commissions are included as a reduction to net sales). Operating Income. Operating income was $1.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $84.8 million, or 7.1% higher than operating income of $1.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income was $180.8 million and $139.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific and South America. Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $106.5 million, or 8.4% higher than operating income of $1.26 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $455.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 million, or 1.2% higher than operating income of $174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income for the Other segment was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million, or 4.0% lower than operating income of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other Income (expense), net. Other non-operating income, net, was $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to other non-operating income, net, of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Foreign currency transaction (losses)/gains were ($4.0) million and ($3.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income was $13.8 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $300.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $80.7 million, or 21.2% lower than the provision for income taxes of $380.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 23.2% from 31.7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 (before considering the potential impact of further clarification of certain matters related to the Tax Reform Act), and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction following the Tax Reform Act as well as a decrease in the stock based compensation tax deduction. Net Income. Net income was $993.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $172.3 million, or 21.0% higher than net income of $820.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to the $157.7 million increase in gross profit and the $80.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. The increase in net income was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of $72.9 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Net Sales. Net sales were $3.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $319.7 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $3.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $287.4 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 360.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 39.0 million cases or 12.2% higher than case sales of 321.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $21.6 million and $17.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.30 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was 1.6% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.45 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower average net sales price per case was primarily attributable to the changes in geographic sales mix. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $287.7 million, or 10.4% higher than net sales of $2.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 45 Table of Contents Net sales for the Other segment were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $195.7 million, or 10.1% higher than the gross profit of $1.94 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2017 from our acquisition of AFF in 2016 (the “AFF Transaction”). The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographical sales mix (our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins) and to certain increases in other costs, which were partially offset by raw material cost savings from the AFF Transaction and changes in domestic product sales mix. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $938.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $82.2 million, or 9.6% higher than total operating expenses of $856.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses of $40.5 million (of which $6.4 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $26.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.9 million for commissions, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $11.1 million, increased expenditures of $9.9 million for allocated trade development and increased expenditures of $8.3 million for merchandise displays. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the $44.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations and to decreased expenditures of $13.9 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Operating Income. Operating income was $1.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $113.4 million, or 10.5% higher than operating income of $1.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 35.6% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Operating income was $139.3 million and $101.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1.26 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $116.2 million, or 10.1% higher than operating income of $1.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the AFF Transaction. Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was $174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $11.3 million, or 7.0% higher than operating income of $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily due to an increase in net sales. Operating income for the Other segment was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $3.3 million, or 143.3% higher than operating income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 46 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net. Other non-operating income (expense), net, was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other non-operating income (expense), net, of ($5.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Foreign currency transaction losses were $3.3 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income, net, was $6.8 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $380.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.9 million, or 3.8% higher than the provision for income taxes of $367.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 31.7% from 34.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions relative to the United States as well as to the increase in equity compensation deductions, due in part to the increase in the related excess tax benefits recorded in net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of $39.8 million of tax expense related to the revaluation of the U.S. net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017, from 35% to the newly enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% due to the Tax Reform Act enacted on December 22, 2017.

The increase in net income was primarily due to the $195.7 million increase in gross profit. The increase in net income was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of $82.2 million and the increase in the provision for income taxes of $13.9 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Gross Sales**. Gross sales were $4.43 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $568.2 million, or 14.7% higher than gross sales of $3.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks were $4.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $560.9 million, or 16.2% higher than gross sales of $3.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.6 million, or 2.7% higher than gross sales of $318.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.3 million, or 6.1% higher than gross sales of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 14.0% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially due to an increase in commissions of $42.2 million included in net sales, related to the adoption of ASC 606 described above. 47 Table of Contents Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Gross sales were $3.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $375.9 million, or 10.8% higher than gross sales of $3.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $345.1 million of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $318.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.8 million, or 8.1% higher than gross sales of $294.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross sales of our AFF Third-Party Products were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.4 million, or 25.7% higher than gross sales of $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $492.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $56.3 million, or 12.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $436.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. **Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. 48 Table of Contents The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: In thousands Percentage Change Percentage Change 2018 2017 2016 18 vs. 17 17 vs. 16 Gross sales, net of discounts and returns $ 4,429,522 $ 3,861,368 $ 3,485,463 14.7% 10.8% Less: Promotional and other allowances*** 622,339 492,323 436,070 26.4% 12.9% Net Sales $ 3,807,183 $ 3,369,045 $ 3,049,393 13.0% 10.5% ***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $987.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $993.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $57.1 million of stock-based compensation and $57.0 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $98.7 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, an $11.7 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $18.1 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $10.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.9 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.5 million increase in accrued compensation and a $1.9 million increase in income taxes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $48.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $26.1 million increase in inventories, a $20.0 million decrease in deferred revenue and a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $820.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $52.3 million of stock-based compensation and $48.9 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $125.0 million decrease in the TCCC Transaction receivables, a $67.9 million decrease in deferred income taxes, a $29.6 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $11.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $4.5 million increase in 51 Table of Contents accrued compensation and a $4.7 million decrease in distributor receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $71.3 million increase in prepaid income taxes, an $88.9 million increase in inventories, a $19.9 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $8.2 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $4.5 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $3.6 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $273.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $531.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, real property, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements, improvements to real property and acquisition, defense and maintenance of trademarks. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses. Cash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $1.32 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash flows used in financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2018, we had $637.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $320.7 million in short-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 52 Table of Contents Of our $637.5 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2018, $341.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018. We do not currently intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be approximately $100.0 million through December 31, 2019. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2018: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations¹ $ 190,186 $ 99,004 $ 75,149 $ 16,033 $ - Capital Leases 836 836 - - - Operating Leases 27,968 3,954 5,359 3,795 14,860 Purchase Commitments² 49,777 49,777 - - - $ 268,767 $ 153,571 $ 80,508 $ 19,828 $ 14,860 ¹Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. ²Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In addition, $5.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2018. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. In addition, $0.9 million of potential penalties and interest have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2018. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure 53 Table of Contents goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future. Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis. 54 Table of Contents Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value). Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income. Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 there were no impairments recorded. Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Rehab®, Mutant®, Java Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, M3(stylized)®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play(stylized)®, Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai®, Predator® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition, in 2016, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 there were no impairments recorded. Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the 55 Table of Contents asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. Revenue Recognition – The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases, the Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers and the military. The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers. 56 Table of Contents Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses. Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: · discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; · reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; · the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; · the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; · incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; · discounted or free products; · contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and · commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries and/or the TCCC Related Parties. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks including, but not limited to, clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the 57 Table of Contents Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. 62 Table of Contents Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 31% and 28% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2018 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018 to be significant. As of December 31, 2018, we had $637.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $320.7 million in short-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. ITEM 8",2023-12-30 21:14:09.711927

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were positively impacted by approximately $101.9 million as a result of a price increase effective from November 1, 2018 in the United States (“the U.S. Price Increase”) and effective from February 1, 2019 in Canada (the “Canada Price Increase”), on certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net sales of our Strategic Brands segment were $274.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 92.9% and 91.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 6.5% and 7.5% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Other segment represented 0.5% and 0.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $1.62 billion, $1.36 billion and $1.09 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Such sales were approximately 33%, 31% and 28% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce 39 Table of Contentsretailers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below.

(until April 5, 2019), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club) and Costco Wholesale Corporation. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.TCCC, through the TCCC Subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 2%, 3% and 18% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As part of TCCC’s North America Refranchising, the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent TCCC bottlers/distributors and/or TCCC Related Parties. Accordingly, our percentage of net sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries significantly decreased for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 6% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 9% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors.Value Drivers of our BusinessWe believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 153 countries and territories worldwide.40 Table of Contents●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of products to provide more alternatives to consumers and launched Reign Total Body FuelTM high performance energy drinks in the first quarter of 2019. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2020 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018”).As of December 31, 2019, the Company had working capital of $1.66 billion compared to $1.20 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.12 billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.11 billion as compared to $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Principal uses of cash flows in 2019, were purchases of investments, repurchase of our common stock, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and acquisitions of property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).Opportunities, Challenges and RisksLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require 41 Table of Contentscertain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;●the impact of TCCC’s bottlers/distributors distributing Coca-Cola brand energy drinks;●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;●increase in costs of raw materials used by us;●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes, related labor issues or other importation impediments;●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans in general as well as certain package containers and lids such as the aluminum 24-ounce cap can and resealable lids;●limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production as well for 550ml products utilizing BRE resealable lids;42 Table of Contents●the impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:●domestic and international growth potential of our products;●growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels; and●continued focus on reducing our cost base.43 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth key statistics for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(In thousands, except per share amounts) ​ ​​ ​​ ​Percentage​Percentage​​​​​​​​​​​Change​Change​ 2019​2018​2017​19 vs. 18​18 vs. 17Net sales1​ $ 4,200,819​ $ 3,807,183​ $ 3,369,045​10.3%​13.0%Cost of sales​ 1,682,234​ 1,511,808​ 1,231,355​11.3%​22.8%Gross profit*1​ 2,518,585​ 2,295,375​ 2,137,690​9.7%​7.4%Gross profit as a percentage of net sales​ 60.0%​ 60.3%​ 63.5%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating expenses2​ 1,115,646​ 1,011,756​ 938,903​10.3%​7.8%Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales​ 26.6%​ 26.6%​ 27.9%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income1,2​ 1,402,939​ 1,283,619​ 1,198,787​9.3%​7.1%Operating income as a percentage of net sales​ 33.4%​ 33.7%​ 35.6%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Other income, net​ 13,023​ 9,653​ 2,836​34.9%​240.4%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Income before provision for income taxes1,2​ 1,415,962​ 1,293,272​ 1,201,623​9.5%​7.6%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Provision for income taxes​ 308,127​ 300,268​ 380,945​2.6%​(21.2%)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes​ 21.8%​ 23.2%​ 31.7%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net income1,2​ $ 1,107,835​ $ 993,004​ $ 820,678​11.6%​21.0%Net income as a percentage of net sales​ 26.4%​ 26.1%​ 24.4%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net income per common share:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Basic​ $ 2.04​ $ 1.78​ $ 1.45​14.6%​23.1%Diluted​ $ 2.03​ $ 1.76​ $ 1.42​15.2%​23.8%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Case sales (in thousands) (in 192‑ounce case equivalents)​ 448,770​ 410,886​ 359,957​9.2%​14.1%​¹ Includes $46.3 million, $44.3 million and $43.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue.2 Includes $11.3 million, $26.6 million and $35.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to distributor termination costs.*Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses.

Gross sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand.Gross sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.6 million, or 2.7% higher than gross sales of $318.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.Gross sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.3 million, or 6.1% higher than gross sales of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $622.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $130.0 million, or 26.4% higher than promotional and other allowances of $492.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 14.0% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially due to an increase in commissions of $42.2 million included in net sales, related to the adoption of ASC 606.Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.**Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in 49 Table of Contentsaccordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage​PercentageIn thousands​​​​​​​​​ Change​Change​ 2019 2018 2017 19 vs. 18​18 vs. 17Gross sales, net of discounts and returns​ $ 4,867,698​ $ 4,429,522​ $ 3,861,368 9.9%​14.7%Less: Promotional and other allowances***​ 666,879​ 622,339​ 492,323 7.2%​26.4%Net Sales​ $ 4,200,819​ $ 3,807,183​ $ 3,369,045 10.3%​13.0%​***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.SalesThe table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more 50 Table of Contentspronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $1.11 billion and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $64.8 million of depreciation and amortization and $63.4 million of stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $28.8 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.9 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $9.5 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, an $8.1 million increase in income taxes payable, a $7.2 million increase in accrued compensation, a $6.5 million decrease in distributor receivables and a $1.3 million decrease in deferred income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to an $85.2 million increase in inventories, a $66.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $24.9 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $14.3 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a $13.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $993.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $57.1 million of stock-based compensation and $57.0 million of depreciation and amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $98.7 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, an $11.7 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $18.1 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $10.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.9 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.5 million increase in accrued compensation and a $1.9 million increase in income taxes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $48.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $26.1 million increase in inventories, a $20.0 million decrease in deferred revenue and a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.52 Table of ContentsCash flows (used in) provided by investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $326.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $273.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.For both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisition of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, real property, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements, improvements to real property as well as the acquisition, defense and maintenance of trademarks. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.Cash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $628.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.32 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The cash flows used in financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock.Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $533.1 million in short-term investments and $12.9 million in long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Of our $798.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2019, $416.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2019.We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately $150.0 million through December 31, 2020. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.53 Table of ContentsThe following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments due by period (in thousands)​ ​​ Less than 1‑3 3‑5 More thanObligations​Total​1 year years years 5 years​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Contractual Obligations¹​ $ 181,896​ $ 121,675​ $ 56,721​ $ 3,500​ $ —Finance Leases​ 1,500​ 1,500​ —​ —​ —Operating Leases​ 33,814​ 3,661​ 6,203​ 5,762​ 18,188Purchase Commitments²​ 86,712​ 86,712​ —​ —​ —​​ $ 303,922​ $ 213,548​ $ 62,924​ $ 9,262​ $ 18,188​1 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments.2 Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.In addition, approximately $3.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2019. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2019, we had $0.4 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.Accounting Policies and PronouncementsCritical Accounting PoliciesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination.Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell 54 Table of Contentsin the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value).Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting 55 Table of Contentsunit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments recorded.Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Reign Total Body FuelTM, Reign InfernoTM, M3(stylized)®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai®, Predator® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition, in 2016 through our acquisition of AFF, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments recorded.Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.Revenue Recognition – The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases, the 56 Table of ContentsCompany sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value retailers, e-commerce retailers and the military.The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products;●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers;●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;●discounted or free products;●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries and/or the TCCC Related Parties.The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such 57 Table of Contentsestimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years.The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks including, but not limited to, clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting 58 Table of Contentspronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-Looking StatementsThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.​ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 33% and 31% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year 62 Table of Contentsended December 31, 2019, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2019 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2019 to be significant.As of December 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.ITEM 8",2023-12-30 21:14:09.534308

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections:●The COVID-19 Pandemic – a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business employees and operations;●Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures;●Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements;●Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases;●Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results;●Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations;●Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements;●Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and●Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks”).The COVID – 19 PandemicThe current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, and consequently businesses (including the Company and its suppliers, full service beverage bottlers/distributors (“bottlers/distributors”), co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”We have been actively addressing the COVID-19 pandemic with a global task force team working to mitigate the potential impacts to our people and business. 43 Table of ContentsHealth and Safety of our Employees and Business Partners From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Early in March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Currently, certain of our offices have partially reopened in the U.S. and in certain countries, and generally, our field sales teams are working with our bottler/distributors and retailers subject to certain safety protocols. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to support our employees, including increasing employee communications, including topics such as mental health and family welfare; creating wellness hotlines and enhancing employee assistance programs; and conducting employee surveys to evaluate employee morale. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers/distributors around the world who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Customer DemandDespite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While the performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March 2020, we have seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption. Our sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel (which is our largest channel) but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third and fourth quarters. Our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in 2020, while our food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the Company, remained challenged. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts on future periods cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (many of which are outside our control). We have recently seen a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Hemisphere while cases in the Southern Hemisphere continue to increase. As a result, a number of countries, particularly in EMEA, have reinstituted lockdowns and other restrictions, which could further impact customer demand.A reduction in demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the financial conditions of retailers and consumers, resulting in reduced or canceled orders for our products, purchase returns and closings of retail or wholesale establishments or other locations in which our products are sold.Our Distribution and Supply ChainAs of the date of this filing, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers/distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually addressing the increase in our aluminum can requirements given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Overall, we are not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages and our supply chain remains intact. Depending on the duration of any COVID-19 pandemic related issues, we may experience material disruptions in our supply chain as the pandemic continues.44 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.Our BusinessOverviewWe develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:● Monster Energy®● Monster Energy Ultra®● Monster Rehab®● Monster MAXX®● Java Monster®● Muscle Monster®● Espresso Monster®● Punch Monster®● Juice Monster®● Monster Hydro® Energy Water● Monster Hydro® Super Sport● Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®● Monster Super Fuel®● Monster Dragon Tea®● Reign Total Body Fuel®● Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel ● NOS®● Full Throttle®● Burn®● Mother®● Nalu®● Ultra Energy®● Play® and Power Play® (stylized)● Relentless®● BPM®● BU®● Gladiator®● Samurai®● Live+®● Predator®● Fury®​Our net sales of $4.60 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented record annual net sales.

(including Sam’s Club), Costco Wholesale Corporation and Amazon.com, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 12%, 13% and 13% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 11%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors.Value Drivers of our BusinessWe believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 154 countries and territories worldwide.46 Table of Contents●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of products to provide more alternatives to consumers and launched Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks in the first quarter of 2019. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2021 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019”).As of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $2.39 billion compared to $1.66 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.41 billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.36 billion as compared to $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Principal uses of cash flows in 2020, were purchases of investments, repurchase of our common stock, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and acquisitions of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).Opportunities, Challenges and RisksLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require 47 Table of Contentscertain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:●the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic;●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;●the impact of TCCC’s bottlers/distributors distributing Coca-Cola brand energy drinks;●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;●increases in costs of raw materials used by us;●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes and/or port congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other importation impediments;●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans in general, and in particular, in certain package configurations such as the aluminum 24-ounce cap can and 550ml aluminum can utilizing BRE resealable lids;48 Table of Contents●limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production as well for 550ml products utilizing BRE resealable lids;●the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:●domestic and international growth potential of our products;●growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels; and●continued focus on reducing our cost base.49 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth key statistics for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(In thousands, except per share amounts) ​ ​​ ​​ ​Percentage​Percentage​​​​​​​​​​​Change​Change​ 2020​2019​2018​20 vs. 19​19 vs. 18Net sales1​$ 4,598,638​$ 4,200,819​$ 3,807,183​9.5%​10.3%Cost of sales​ 1,874,758​ 1,682,234​ 1,511,808​11.4%​11.3%Gross profit*1​ 2,723,880​ 2,518,585​ 2,295,375​8.2%​9.7%Gross profit as a percentage of net sales​ 59.2%​ 60.0%​ 60.3%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating expenses2​ 1,090,727​ 1,115,646​ 1,011,756​(2.2)%​10.3%Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales​ 23.7%​ 26.6%​ 26.6%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income1,2​ 1,633,153​ 1,402,939​ 1,283,619​16.4%​9.3%Operating income as a percentage of net sales​ 35.5%​ 33.4%​ 33.7%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Other (expense) income, net​ (6,996)​ 13,023​ 9,653​(153.7)%​34.9%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Income before provision for income taxes1,2​ 1,626,157​ 1,415,962​ 1,293,272​14.8%​9.5%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Provision for income taxes​ 216,563​ 308,127​ 300,268​(29.7)%​2.6%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes​ 13.3%​ 21.8%​ 23.2%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net income1,2​$ 1,409,594​$ 1,107,835​$ 993,004​27.2%​11.6%Net income as a percentage of net sales​ 30.7%​ 26.4%​ 26.1%​ ​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net income per common share:​ ​​ ​ ​ ​ Basic​$ 2.66​$ 2.04​$ 1.78​30.3%​14.6%Diluted​$ 2.64​$ 2.03​$ 1.76​30.0%​15.2%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Case sales (in thousands) (in 192‑ounce case equivalents)​ 504,821​ 448,770​ 410,886​12.5%​9.2%​¹ Includes $42.1 million, $46.3 million and $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue.2 Includes $0.2 million, $11.3 million and $26.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to distributor termination costs.*Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses.

Net sales were $4.60 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $397.8 million, or 9.5% higher than net sales of $4.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.50 Table of ContentsNet sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $4.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $401.2 million, or 10.3% higher than net sales of $3.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and increased sales by volume for our Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, both as a result of increased consumer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on net sales of the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $266.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $8.6 million, or 3.1% lower than net sales of $274.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on net sales of the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was more pronounced in the Strategic Brand segment, particularly in EMEA, as our largest revenue generating countries for this segment experienced extended lockdowns. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.Net sales for the Other segment were $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $5.2 million, or 23.7% higher than net sales of $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 504.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately 56.1 million cases or 12.5% higher than case sales of 448.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $27.0 million and $21.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.06 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was 2.8% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.31 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $205.3 million, or 8.2% higher than the gross profit of $2.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $401.2 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 59.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 60.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs as well as geographical sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (excluding the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) was 59.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020.Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $24.9 million, or 2.2% lower than total operating expenses of $1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased expenditures of $46.7 million for sponsorship and endorsements, decreased expenditures of $27.7 million for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased expenditures of $14.7 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures of $11.1 million related to the costs associated with distributor terminations. The costs for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been, or may be, deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in what future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Provision for legal settlements for the year ended December 31, 2020 was lower by $14.7 million than in the comparable 2019 period. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $43.1 million (of 51 Table of Contentswhich $6.9 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $25.3 million for social media and digital marketing, and increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $21.7 million.Operating Income. Operating income was $1.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $230.2 million, or 16.4% higher than operating income of $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 35.5% and 33.4% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Operating income was $270.8 million and $229.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with our operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific and South America. Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $1.82 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $254.4 million, or 16.2% higher than operating income of $1.57 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $401.2 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $155.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $9.0 million, or 5.5% lower than operating income of $164.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $2.3 million, or 62.3% higher than operating income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Other (Expense) Income, net. Other non-operating (expense) income, net, was $(7.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to other non-operating (expense) income, net, of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Provision for income taxes was $216.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $91.6 million, or 29.7% lower than the provision for income taxes of $308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 13.3% from 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis for such intangible assets. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the decrease in the equity compensation deduction. Net Income. Net income was $1.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $301.8 million, or 27.2% higher than net income of $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income was primarily due to the $205.3 million increase in gross profit, the decrease in the provision for income taxes of $91.6 million and the decrease in operating expenses of $24.9 million.

Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to (i) sales of our Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, introduced in the first quarter of 2019, (ii) the price increases described above, and (iii) increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $21.9 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) increased to $9.31 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was 1.1% higher than the average net sales per case of $9.21 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the average net sales per case was primarily attributable to a price increase effective from November 1, 2018 in the United States and effective from February 1, 2019 in Canada, on certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $223.2 million, or 9.7% higher than the gross profit of $2.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Such decrease was partially offset by the sales price increases discussed above.Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $103.9 million, or 10.3% higher than total operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage​PercentageIn thousands​​​​​​​​​ Change​Change​ 2020 2019 2018 20 vs. 19​19 vs. 18Gross Billings​$ 5,328,683​$ 4,821,411​$ 4,385,262 10.5%​9.9%Deferred Revenue​​ 42,110​​ 46,287​​ 44,260​(9.0%)​4.6%Less: Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses***​ (772,155)​ (666,879)​ (622,339) 15.8%​7.2%Net Sales​$ 4,598,638​$ 4,200,819​$ 3,807,183 9.5%​10.3%​***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The 56 Table of Contentspresentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.SalesThe table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.57 Table of ContentsOur quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

The cash flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $881.4 million in short-term investments and $44.3 million in long-term investments, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Of our $1.18 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2020, $677.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2020. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately $150.0 million through December 31, 2021. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. 60 Table of ContentsThe following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments due by period (in thousands)​ ​​ Less than 1‑3 3‑5 More thanObligations​Total​1 year years years 5 years​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Contractual Obligations¹​$ 129,255​$ 97,979​$ 31,223​$ 53​$ —Finance Leases​ 828​ 803​ 22​ 3​ —Operating Leases​ 24,393​ 3,785​ 5,518​ 3,502​ 11,588Purchase Commitments²​ 101,815​ 101,815​ —​ —​ —​​$ 256,291​$ 204,382​$ 36,763​$ 3,558​$ 11,588​1 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments.2 Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $0.1 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.Accounting Policies and PronouncementsCritical Accounting PoliciesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination.Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.61 Table of ContentsInvestments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 326-30-35, a security is considered to be impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Where the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss, the Company will record an impairment relating to credit losses through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments has resulted from credit loss or other factors at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment has resulted from credit loss or other factors include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value).Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.62 Table of ContentsGoodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Monster Super Fuel®, Espresso Monster®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, M3(stylized)®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai®, Predator® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition, in 2016 through our acquisition of AFF, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 no impairments were recorded.Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.63 Table of ContentsForeign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2020 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.Revenue Recognition – The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases, the Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value retailers, e-commerce retailers and the military.The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products;●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;64 Table of Contents●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers;●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;●discounted or free products;●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years.The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks including, but not limited to, clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates, supplement ingredients and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred 65 Table of Contentstax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-Looking StatementsThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.​70 Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum cans, as well as sugar, sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 33% and 32% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2020 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2020 to be significant.As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $925.6 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.ITE",2023-12-30 21:14:11.414686
865752,MNST,Monster Beverage Corp,2022,"EM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections:●The COVID-19 Pandemic – a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business employees and operations;●Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures;●Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020;●Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases;●Inflation – information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results;●Liquidity and Capital Resources – an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations;●Accounting Policies and Pronouncements – a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements;●Forward-Looking Statements – cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical results or our current expectations or projections; and●Market Risks – information about market risks and risk management. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risks”).The COVID – 19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”We continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic with a global task force team working to mitigate the potential impacts on our people and business. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers/distributors around the world who are endeavoring to maintain the integrity of our supply chain. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record annual net sales in 2021.As countries continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and as governments and/or local authorities impose regulations regarding COVID-19 testing, vaccine mandates and related workplace restrictions, there remains a risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and supply chain, including our ability to recruit and/or retain our employees as well as impact our co-packers, bottlers/distributors and/or suppliers.44 Table of ContentsA reduction in demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the financial conditions of retailers and consumers, resulting in reduced or canceled orders for our products, purchase returns and closings of retail or wholesale establishments or other locations in which our products are sold. Our Distribution and Supply ChainIn 2021, we experienced a number of global supply chain challenges as a result of unanticipated increases in demand, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely impacted both cost of sales and operating costs, and in certain markets, affected the availability of our products on shelves at retailers. In particular, we have experienced shortages in our aluminum can requirements, freight inefficiencies, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, and delays in the receipt and/or availability of certain ingredients. In the United States, we lacked sufficient co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of our products. We have also experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition, we experienced increased ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, increased outbound freight costs and production inefficiencies, which resulted in increased costs of sales and increased operating costs.We have addressed and will continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain, which remains largely intact. Additional can manufacturing capacity in the United States has been secured for 2022, although the Company will continue to import aluminum cans to supplement its domestic can supply. Can capacity in EMEA remains challenging and the Company expects to continue to import aluminum cans into EMEA for at least 2022. While co-packing capacity in the United States and EMEA also continues to be challenging, we have expanded our network in the United States and EMEA to substantially address supply constraints. Our flavor facility in Athy, Ireland is operational, producing certain flavors and blends for the EMEA region, is steadily increasing production, and is investigating the feasibility of a juice plant to produce EMEA’s juice product requirements. We continue to implement measures to mitigate our increased operating costs through pricing actions and reductions in promotions.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.45 Table of ContentsOur BusinessOverviewWe develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:● Monster Energy®● Monster Energy Ultra®● Monster Rehab®● Monster Energy® Nitro● Java Monster®● Muscle Monster®● Espresso Monster®● Punch Monster®● Juice Monster®● Monster Hydro® Energy Water● Monster Hydro® Super Sport● Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®● Monster Super Fuel®● Monster Dragon Tea®● Reign Total Body Fuel®● Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel ● NOS®● Full Throttle®● Burn®● Mother®● Nalu®● Ultra Energy®● Play® and Power Play® (stylized)● Relentless®● BPM®● BU®● Gladiator®● Samurai®● Live+®● Predator®● Fury®● True North®​The comparative results of operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 included a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis for such intangible assets (the “Non-Recurring Tax Benefit”), as well as reduced marketing, sponsorships and certain other operating expenses, largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These items should be taken into consideration when evaluating comparative performance for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020.Our net sales of $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented record annual net sales. The comparative net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan (the “Product Returns”). Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $5.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net sales of our Strategic Brands segment were $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 94.2% and 93.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 5.3% and 5.8% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Other segment represented 0.5% and 0.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The comparative net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns.Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net sales of the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency 46 Table of Contentsexchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Net sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $2.04 billion, $1.51 billion and $1.33 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such sales were approximately 37%, 33% and 32% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The comparative net sales to customers outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns.Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. Percentages of our gross billings to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below.

We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors.CANarchy AcquisitionOn February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC (“CANarchy”), a craft beer and hard seltzer company, for $330.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments. The transaction allows us to enter the alcohol beverage 47 Table of Contentssector and brings the Cigar City family of brands including Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, the Oskar Blues family of brands including Dale’s Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzers, the Deep Ellum family of brands including Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA, the Perrin Brewing family of brands including Black Ale, the Squatters family of brands including Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and the Wasatch family of brands including Apricot Hefeweizen to our beverage portfolio. The transaction does not include CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team.​Value Drivers of our BusinessWe believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our brands internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 154 countries and territories worldwide.●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2022 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”).As of December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of $3.72 billion compared to $2.39 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.38 billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.16 billion as compared to $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Principal uses of cash flows in 2021, were purchases of investments, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and 48 Table of Contentsacquisitions of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).Opportunities, Challenges and RisksLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:●the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic;●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;49 Table of Contents●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;●the risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;●increases in costs of raw materials used by us;●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or port congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other importation impediments;●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans;●the increased costs resulting from importing aluminum cans and other raw materials and ingredients;●limitations on co-packing availability;●increases in ocean and domestic freight rates;●shortages of shipping containers and port congestion;●the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:●domestic and international growth potential of our products;●growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;●growth potential of the affordable energy drink category;●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels;●continued focus on reducing our cost base ; and●our entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcoholic portfolio.50 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThis section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020.

Net sales increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns.Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $5.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $915.4 million, or 21.3% higher than net sales of $4.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $28.4 million, or 10.7% higher than net sales of $266.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Predator®, Burn® and Mother® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Shortages of certain NOS® concentrates negatively impacted net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $4.3 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2021.Net sales for the Other segment were $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $1.1 million, or 4.1% lower than net sales of $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 613.4 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 108.6 million cases or 21.5% higher than case sales of 504.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $25.9 million and $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $8.99 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was 0.7% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.06 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average net sales per case was primarily the result of geographical sales mix.Gross ProfitGross profit was $3.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $384.6 million, or 14.1% higher than the gross profit of $2.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased costs of certain other raw materials and ingredients, increased freight-in costs and geographical sales mix.52 Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesTotal operating expenses were $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $220.3 million, or 20.2% higher than total operating expenses of $1.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 23.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $86.1 million, increased payroll expenses of $42.5 million, increased expenditures of $38.1 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.7 million for social media and digital marketing, and increased expenditures of $10.4 million for professional service expenses, including accounting and legal costs. The increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, was partially offset by $16.9 million due to the reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. During the comparative 2020 period, the Company decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs during the year ended December 31, 2021.

The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $915.4 million increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $18.6 million, or 12.0% higher than operating income of $155.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily the result of the $28.4 million increase in net sales. Operating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.0 million, or 16.9% higher than operating income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net, was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to other income (expense), net, of ($7.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were $0.3 million and ($11.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the $207.4 million increase in the provision for income taxes and the $220.3 million increase in operating expenses, partially offset by the $393.1 million increase in gross profit.Key Business MetricsWe use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate and manage our business. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics” below.Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key MetricsGross Billings**Gross billings were $6.42 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.10 billion, or 20.6% higher than gross billings of $5.33 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross billings of approximately $83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative gross billings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $6.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion, or 21.3% higher than gross billings of $5.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns.Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment were $340.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $34.8 million, or 11.4% higher than gross billings of $305.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Shortages of NOS® concentrate negatively impacted gross billings for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on gross billings in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross billings for the Other segment were $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 4.1% lower than gross billings of $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses, as described in the footnote below, were $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $152.6 million, or 19.8% higher than promotional allowances, 54 Table of Contentscommissions and other expenses of $772.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross billings decreased to 12.8% from 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.**Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts and returns. Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage PercentageIn thousands​​​​​​​​​ Change​Change​ 2021 2020 2019 21 vs. 20​20 vs. 19Gross Billings​$ 6,424,632​$ 5,328,683​$ 4,821,411 20.6%​10.5%Deferred Revenue​​ 41,462​​ 42,110​​ 46,287​(1.5%)​(9.0%)Less: Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses***​ (924,742)​ (772,155)​ (666,879) 19.8%​15.8%Net Sales​$ 5,541,352​$ 4,598,638​$ 4,200,819 20.5%​9.5%​***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.SalesThe table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.55 Table of ContentsOur quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.75 billion in short-term investments and $99.4 million in long-term investments, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Of our $1.33 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2021, $608.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2021. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately $150.0 million through December 31, 2022. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.57 Table of ContentsThe following summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​Net cash provided by (used in): ​​ ​​ ​​​ ​2021 ​2020 ​2019Operating activities​$ 1,155,741​$ 1,364,163​$ 1,113,762Investing activities​$ (992,022)​$ (472,487)​$ (326,724)Financing activities​$ 34,821​$ (526,068)​$ (628,506)​Cash flows provided by operating activities.

It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months.Accounting Policies and PronouncementsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies.59 Table of ContentsThe following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.Other Intangibles – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019 no impairments were recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles.Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; ●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; ●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; ●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; ●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; ●discounted or free products; ●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and ●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.60 Table of ContentsThe Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (the “Exchange Act”) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things.

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty 65 Table of Contentsto provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum cans, as well as sugar, sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37% and 33% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2021 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021 to be significant.As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.75 billion in short-term investments and $99.4 million in long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.ITE",2023-12-30 21:14:10.793215

(See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risks”).CANarchy AcquisitionOn February 17, 2022, we completed the CANarchy Transaction. The CANarchy Transaction facilitates our entry into the alcohol beverage sector and brings the Cigar CityTM family of brands including Jai Alai® IPA and Florida ManTM IPA, the Oskar BluesTM family of brands including Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, the Deep EllumTM family of brands including Dallas Blonde® and Deep EllumTM IPA, the Perrin Brewing CompanyTM family of brands including Black Ale, the Squatters® family of brands including Hop Rising® Double IPA, and the Wasatch® family of brands including Apricot Hefeweizen to our beverage portfolio. The CANarchy Transaction did not include CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business remains unchanged. CANarchy is functioning independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team.​44 Table of ContentsRussia-Ukraine ConflictDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Net sales in Russia and Ukraine combined were approximately 1.1% of our total net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor future developments relative to this conflict and its potential impacts.​The COVID – 19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”Pricing ActionsIn 2022, we implemented measures to mitigate our increased costs through price increases and reductions in promotions (“Pricing Actions”). We implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and implemented price increases at various times in certain international markets, all of which positively impacted gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.Distribution and Supply ChainSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for our energy drinks, we prioritized ensuring product availability for our customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting our profitability. We continue to stand by our strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of our brands.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced a significant increase in cost of sales, resulting in a material decrease in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, relative to the comparative year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to (i) increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, (ii) increased logistical costs, (iii) increased aluminum can costs and (iv) geographical and product sales mix.In the third and fourth quarters of 2022 we began to see an improvement in our gross profit margins as compared to the second quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily attributable to (i) Pricing Actions, (ii) our decreased reliance on imported cans and (iii) improved finished product inventory levels in closer proximity to our customers, resulting in a reduction of long-distance freight costs. Furthermore, we experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses, as well as increases in other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating costs.We continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.45 Table of ContentsOur BusinessOverviewWe develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:●Monster Energy®●Monster Energy Ultra®●Monster Rehab®●Monster Energy® Nitro●Java Monster®●Punch Monster®●Juice Monster®●Monster Hydro® Energy Water●Monster Hydro® Super Sport●Monster Super Fuel®●Monster Dragon Tea®●Reign Total Body Fuel®●Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel●Reign Storm®●True North®●NOS®●Full Throttle®●Burn®●Mother®●Nalu®●Ultra Energy®●Play® and Power Play® (stylized)●Relentless®●BPM®●BU®●Gladiator®●Samurai®●Live+®●Predator®●Fury®​We also develop, market, sell and distribute craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida ManTM IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep EllumTM IPA, Perrin Brewing CompanyTM Black Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast UnleashedTM and a host of other brands.We also develop, market, sell and distribute still and sparkling waters under the Monster® Tour WaterTM brand name.Our net sales of $6.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented record annual net sales.

We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) reducing our expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2023 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $3.76 billion compared to $3.72 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable and inventories, related to the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $887.7 million as compared to $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Principal uses of cash flows in 2022 were purchases of investments, purchases of treasury stock, the acquisition of CANarchy, development of our brands internationally and acquisitions of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).48 Table of ContentsOpportunities, Challenges and RisksLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy and alcohol drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine and/or alcohol content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits, or alcohol drinks and their misuse or abuse, as well as articles indicating certain health risks of energy or alcohol drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles as well as alcohol consumption continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity and alcohol abuse and misuse are complex and serious public health problems. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine and/or alcohol consumption and energy and/or alcohol drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;49 Table of Contents●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;●the risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;●increases in costs of raw materials used by us;●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or port congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other importation impediments;●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and our continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans, other packaging materials and ingredients;●limitations on co-packing availability and in particular, consolidation in the co-packing industry; ●increases in ocean and domestic freight rates;●the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; ●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy or alcohol drinks, limiting caffeine or alcohol content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions; and●the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic.See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:●domestic and international growth potential of our products;●growth potential of the energy drink and alcohol beverage categories, both domestically and internationally;●growth potential of the affordable energy drink category;●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels;●continued focus on reducing our cost base; and●our entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcohol portfolio.50 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThis section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021.

Net sales increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand, as well as due to pricing actions and reductions in promotions in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022.Net sales were $2.20 billion and $1.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $5.83 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $612.5 million, or 11.7% higher than net sales of $5.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Predator® and NOS® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $17.2 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022.Net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021 net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on February 17, 2022. Net sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than net sales of $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Case sales for our energy drink products, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 701.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 88.2 million cases or 14.4% higher than case sales of 613.4 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2021. The overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products (excluding net sales of Alcohol Brands and Other segments) decreased to $8.82 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was 1.9% lower than the average net sales per case of $8.99 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average net sales per case was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Barrel sales for our craft beers and hard seltzers, in 31 US gallon equivalents, were 0.3 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022).Gross ProfitGross profit was $3.17 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $66.1 million, or 2.1% higher than the gross profit of $3.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. 52 Table of ContentsGross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased co-packing fees, production inefficiencies and geographical sales mix. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were $1.59 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $278.8 million, or 21.3% higher than total operating expenses of $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $16.9 million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses of $92.9 million, including travel and entertainment, professional service fees (including legal and accounting) and depreciation and amortization, increased out-bound fuel, freight and warehouse costs of $74.3 million, increased selling and marketing expenses of $59.9 million, including sponsorships and endorsements, point of sale, premiums and allocated trade development, and increased payroll expenses of $57.0 million (of which $23.1 million was related to CANarchy). In addition, CANarchy related depreciation and amortization was $8.7 million for year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in distributor termination expenses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 25.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 (pre COVID-19) were $1.12 billion, or 26.6% of net sales.Operating Income Operating income was $1.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $212.7 million, or 11.8% lower than operating income of $1.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 32.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses as well as the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.Operating income was $316.3 million and $402.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $1.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $140.7 million, or 7.1% lower than operating income of $1.99 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses as well as a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales.Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $24.0 million, or 13.8% higher than operating income of $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily the result of a $30.6 million increase in gross profit.Operating loss for the Alcohol Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due in part to (i) excess depreciation and amortization as well as the fair value treatment of purchased inventory, all relating to the CANarchy Transaction, (ii) increased input costs and an underutilization 53 Table of Contentsof fixed overhead and (iii) sales volume declines primarily of Wild BasinTM due in part to overall sales declines in the hard seltzer category. The inventory acquired, which was subsequently sold, was recognized through cost of goods sold at fair value (purchased cost), resulting in no recognized profits on the associated sales.Operating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.9 million, or 56.2% lower than operating income of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income, net, was ($12.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other (expense) income, net, of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were ($37.9) million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate was 24.2% and 23.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in income in certain foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the United States.Net IncomeNet income was $1.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $185.9 million, or 13.5% lower than net income of $1.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in the gross profit percentage of net sales as well as the increase in operating expenses.Key Business MetricsWe use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate and manage our business. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics” below.Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key MetricsGross Billings**Gross billings were $7.26 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $837.0 million, or 13.0% higher than gross billings of $6.42 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings of approximately $285.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $6.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $678.4 million, or 11.2% higher than gross billings of $6.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand, as well as due to price increases in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on 54 Table of Contentsgross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $268.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment were $398.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $58.6 million, or 17.2% higher than gross billings of $340.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.Gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment were $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021 gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on February 17, 2022.Gross billings for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than gross billings of $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses, as described in the footnote below, were $990.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $65.8 million, or 7.1% higher than promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses of $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross billings were 13.6% and 14.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.**Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts, returns and excise taxes. Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.55 Table of ContentsThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage Percentage​In thousands​​​​​​​​​ Change​Change​​ 2022 2021 2020 22 vs. 21​21 vs. 20​Gross Billings​$ 7,261,639​$ 6,424,632​$ 5,328,683 13.0% 20.6%Deferred Revenue​​ 39,969​​ 41,462​​ 42,110​ (3.6)% (1.5)%Less: Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses***​ (990,558)​ (924,742)​ (772,155) 7.1% 19.8%Net Sales​$ 6,311,050​$ 5,541,352​$ 4,598,638 13.9% 20.5%​***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to our non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs for our energy drink products with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for our energy drink products for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.SalesThe table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.Sales of our energy drinks are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. Beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. The 56 Table of ContentsCOVID-19 pandemic, including new variants, may also have an impact on consumer behavior and change the seasonal fluctuation of our business.

A Barrel is a unit of measurement equal to 31 U.S. gallons. Barrel sales were 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022).InflationInflation had a negative impact on our results of operations, leading to increased cost of sales and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. To mitigate the impact of inflation, we implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and continue to implement price increases in certain international markets where feasible. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in short-term investments and $61.4 million in long-term investments. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Of our $1.31 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2022, $668.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2022. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than $300.0 million through December 31, 2023. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.58 Table of ContentsPurchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.The following summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​Net cash provided by (used in): ​​ ​​ ​​​ 2022 2021 2020Operating activities​$ 887,699​$ 1,155,741​$ 1,364,163Investing activities​$ (161,367)​$ (992,022)​$ (472,487)Financing activities​$ (706,938)​$ 34,821​$ (526,068)​Cash flows provided by operating activities.

For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities included $329.5 million (net of cash acquired), related to the CANarchy Transaction.

These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.In addition, approximately $3.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2022. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, we had $0.4 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.Accounting Policies and PronouncementsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies.60 Table of ContentsThe following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no goodwill impairments recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.Other Intangibles – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $2.2 million was recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2021 no impairment charges were recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles.Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to the Company’s non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; ●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; ●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; ●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; ●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; ●discounted or free products; ●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and 61 Table of Contents●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.The Company’s promotional allowance programs for its energy drink products with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.Promotional and other allowances for the Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our 66 Table of Contentsforward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of aluminum cans, as well as sugar, sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, juice concentrates, milk, cream, coffee, tea, hops, malt and yeast, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, as well as limitations in the availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials and packaging materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37% of consolidated net sales for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2022 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022 to be significant.As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in short-term investments and $61.4 million in long-term investments Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.ITE",2023-12-30 21:14:17.156665
