1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2017,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWGlobal Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions and diverse regional security concerns. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally continues to be driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities. Global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2017, reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility. The global economy may also be affected by Britain’s exit from the European Union, the impact of which is not known at this time. Global economic conditions could impact customer purchasing decisions. U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentIn the U.S., there is an uncertain political environment with a new Administration and a new Congress. The U.S. continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for its discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. Part II mandated substantial additional reductions, through a process known as “sequestration,” which took effect in March 2013.On November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the Budget Act). The Budget Act raised the debt ceiling until March 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act by $80 billion, split equally between defense and non-defense discretionary spending in the Government's FY 2016 and FY 2017 ($50 billion in FY 2016 and $30 billion in FY 2017). Sequestration spending caps under the Budget Control Act could reduce defense spending again in FY 2018. On December 18, 2015, Congress passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided funding for the U.S. Government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. The FY 2016 DoD budget was approximately $580 billion (including $58 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)), which represented an approximately four percent increase relative to DoD funding for FY 2015.On February 9, 2016, the President delivered his FY 2017 budget to Congress. The FY 2017 budget reflected the FY 2017 spending caps established in the Budget Act and requested $583 billion for the DoD’s annual budget, including $59 billion for OCO. The President signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016 and provides funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the company's programs in particular. Additionally, both the incoming Administration and the new Congress have offered plans to reform the federal income tax code, along with other significant policy initiatives, some of which could have an impact on the company. For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically large contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts primarily using the cost-to-cost method of percentage of completion accounting, but in some cases we utilize the units-of-delivery method of percentage of completion accounting. As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred and units delivered across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules that govern our U.S. Government business and related Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), most types of costs are allocable to U.S. Government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor costs, subcontractor costs, material costs, overhead costs and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach -23-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our three segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, deliveries or other indicators of sales activity. Changes in margins are generally described in terms of performance and contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels or delivery rates. Performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix refers to changes in the ratio of contract type, lifecycle, customer or other non-performance impacts on contract profitability.CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSSelected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts2016 2015 2014 20162015Sales$24,508 $23,526 $23,979 4 % (2)%Operating costs and expenses21,315 20,450 20,783 4 % (2)%Operating income3,193 3,076 3,196 4 % (4)%Operating margin rate13.0% 13.1% 13.3% Federal and foreign income tax expense723 800 868 (10)% (8)%Effective income tax rate24.7% 28.7% 29.6% Net earnings2,200 1,990 2,069 11 % (4)%Diluted earnings per share12.19 10.39 9.75 17 % 7 %Sales2016 – Sales increased $982 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.2015 – Sales decreased $453 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2014, primarily due to lower sales on U.S. Government contracts across the company, partially offset by an increase in international sales at Aerospace Systems.See “Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sales by customer category.See “Segment Operating Results” for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail.Operating Costs and Expenses and Operating Margin RateOperating costs and expenses primarily include labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs, and are generally allocated to contracts as incurred. Operating margin rate is defined as operating income as a percentage of sales. In accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts, most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs. Allowable and allocable G&A costs, including independent research and development (IR&D) and bid and proposal costs, are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress.Operating costs and expenses comprise the following: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Product costs$11,002 $10,333 $10,431 6% (1)%Service costs7,729 7,551 7,947 2% (5)%G&A2,584 2,566 2,405 1% 7 %Operating costs and expenses$21,315 $20,450 $20,783 4% (2)%Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales87.0% 86.9% 86.7% G&A as a % of sales10.5% 10.9% 10.0% 2016 – Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2016 as compared with 2015, which reduced our operating margin rate to 13.0 percent from 13.1 percent in the prior year period. The decrease in -24-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION operating margin rate was driven by lower segment margin rates, as described in “Segment Operating Results,” and a $32 million decrease in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, partially offset by a $137 million reduction in unallocated corporate expenses, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.2015 – Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 as compared with 2014, which reduced our operating margin rate to 13.1 percent from 13.3 percent in the prior year period. The decrease in operating margin rate was driven by $179 million of lower segment operating income, as described in “Segment Operating Results,” and $21 million in higher unallocated corporate expenses, partially offset by a $79 million increase in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.2016 – G&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.5 percent in 2016 from 10.9 percent in 2015, principally due to higher sales volume.2015 – G&A as a percentage of sales increased to 10.9 percent in 2015 from 10.0 percent in 2014, principally due to an increase in IR&D as we continue to invest in future business opportunities.For further information regarding product and service sales and costs, see the “Product and Service Analysis” section that follows “Segment Operating Results.”Operating IncomeWe define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses, which includes G&A. 2016 – Operating income increased $117 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to a $137 million reduction in unallocated corporate expenses and higher sales volume, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and lower segment margin rates.2015 – Operating income decreased $120 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2014, primarily due to the lower sales volume described above and the absence in 2015 of a $75 million benefit realized in 2014 in connection with agreements reached with the U.S. Government to settle certain claims relating to use of the company's intellectual property and a terminated program.Federal and Foreign Income Taxes2016 – Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 24.7 percent, as compared with 28.7 percent in 2015. The lower rate is principally due to $85 million of excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payment transactions recognized in 2016 resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a $40 million benefit recognized in connection with resolution of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of the company’s 2007-2011 tax returns and a $33 million benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. These benefits were partially offset by a $58 million decrease in research credits, which were principally a result of credits recorded in 2015 that were claimed on our prior year tax returns. While discrete tax benefits in each year have reduced our effective tax rate below the statutory rate, these items are not indicative of a longer-term trend. On an ongoing basis (excluding impacts associated with ASU No. 2016-09 and assuming no changes in federal tax legislation), we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent due principally to recurring tax benefits associated with the manufacturing deduction and research credits.2015 – Our effective tax rate for 2015 was 28.7 percent, as compared with 29.6 percent in 2014. This reduction was driven by a $76 million increase in research credits primarily resulting from credits claimed on our prior year tax returns, partially offset by a $51 million benefit recorded in 2014 for the partial resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007-2009 tax returns.Net Earnings2016 – Net earnings for 2016 increased $210 million, or 11 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to the higher operating income and lower effective tax rate discussed above.2015 – Net earnings for 2015 decreased $79 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2014, primarily due to lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by the lower effective tax rate described above.Diluted Earnings Per Share2016 – Diluted earnings per share for 2016 increased $1.80, or 17 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase is primarily due to the 11 percent increase in net earnings discussed above and a 6 percent reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased during 2015 and 2016.-25-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 2015 – Diluted earnings per share for 2015 increased $0.64, or 7 percent, as compared with 2014. The increase is primarily due to a 10 percent reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2014 and 2015, partially offset by the 4 percent decline in net earnings discussed above.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationAt December 31, 2016, the company was aligned in three operating sectors, which are also our reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Mission Systems, and Technology Services. Effective January 1, 2016, the company streamlined our sectors from four to three as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aerospace Systems Mission Systems Technology ServicesAutonomous Systems Sensors and Processing Global Logistics and ModernizationManned Aircraft Cyber and ISR Advanced Defense ServicesSpace Advanced Capabilities System Modernization and ServicesThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income table below, is a non-GAAP measure that reflects total earnings from our three segments including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors.

Segment operating margin rate decreased to 12.0 percent from 12.4 percent in 2015 principally due to a lower segment margin rate at Aerospace Systems.2015 - Segment operating income for 2015 decreased $179 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2014 and segment operating margin rate decreased to 12.4 percent from 12.9 percent in 2014. The decrease in segment operating income was principally due to lower sales volume and the absence in 2015 of the $75 million in settlements described above and a benefit of approximately $45 million from lower 2014 CAS costs due to passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). The absence in 2015 of the noted settlements and HATFA benefits was the primary driver of the lower 2015 operating margin rate. -26-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income - The table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of net FAS/CAS pension adjustments, as well as unallocated corporate expenses (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS or the FAR). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses.

The increase was due to higher volume on Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. Manned Aircraft sales increased primarily due to higher restricted volume, increased F-35 deliveries and production ramp-up on the E-2D program. These increases were partially offset by lower B-2 volume and fewer F/A-18 deliveries. Autonomous Systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the Triton and Global Hawk programs, partially offset by ramp-down of the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) program. Space sales include higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by lower volume on the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program.Operating income for 2016 increased $31 million, or 3 percent, and includes a gain of $45 million associated with the sale of a property. Higher sales volume and improved performance on Space and Autonomous Systems programs -27-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION were more than offset by lower margins on Manned Aircraft programs, principally due to changes in contract mix and the timing of risk reductions. Operating margin rate decreased to 11.4 percent from 12.1 percent primarily due to the lower margins on Manned Aircraft programs, partially offset by improved performance on Space and Autonomous Systems programs.2015 - Aerospace Systems sales for 2015 were comparable to the prior year. Sales in 2014 included the $75 million in settlements described above. Excluding the settlements, sales for 2015 increased $105 million, or 1 percent, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to higher volume on Autonomous Systems and Space programs, partially offset by lower volume on Manned Aircraft programs. Autonomous Systems sales reflect higher volume on a number of programs, including Global Hawk, partially offset by lower volume on the Fire Scout and NATO AGS programs. Sales in Manned Aircraft declined principally due to fewer F/A-18 deliveries, as that program ramps down, and lower volume on restricted programs, partially offset by the transition to full rate production on the E-2D program and increased deliveries on the F-35 program. Space sales include higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by lower volume on the AEHF program.Operating income for 2015 decreased $80 million, or 6 percent, and operating margin rate decreased to 12.1 percent from 13.0 percent. Lower operating income and margin rate in 2015 were primarily due to the benefits recognized in 2014 associated with the settlements described above.MISSION SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Sales$10,928 $10,674 $11,001 2% (3)%Operating income1,445 1,410 1,557 2% (9)%Operating margin rate13.2% 13.2% 14.2% 2016 - Mission Systems sales for 2016 increased $254 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2015 due to higher volume on Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by lower volume on Cyber and ISR programs. Sensors and Processing sales increased primarily due to higher volume on communications programs, including the Joint Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare program; increased restricted volume and ramp-up on the G/ATOR program. These increases were partially offset by lower volume on international programs. Advanced Capabilities sales increased primarily due to higher volume on restricted, maritime systems and marine systems programs. Cyber and ISR sales reflect lower volume on space programs.Operating income for 2016 increased $35 million, or 2 percent, due to the higher sales volume described above and a $21 million gain associated with the sale of a commercial cyber security product business, partially offset by a $49 million forward loss provision recorded on an Advanced Capabilities program principally due to cost growth for changes impacting fixed-price options, which may not be fully recovered through additional contract value. Operating margin rate for 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015 and reflects improved performance on Sensors and Processing programs, partially offset by lower margins on Advanced Capabilities programs.2015 - Mission Systems sales for 2015 decreased $327 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2014. The decrease was due to lower volume across the sector. Advanced Capabilities sales decreased primarily due to the impact of in-theater force reductions, lower volume on the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services program and completion of the Ground Combat Vehicle contract. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on marine systems and missile defense programs. The decrease in Cyber and ISR sales is primarily due to lower volume on restricted programs, partially offset by higher volume on cyber solutions programs. Sensors and Processing sales decreased primarily due to ramp-down on an international program and lower volume on the LITENING program. These decreases were partially offset by ramp-up on the G/ATOR program and higher volume on fixed wing avionics and C4ISR programs.Operating income for 2015 decreased $147 million, or 9 percent. Operating margin rate decreased to 13.2 percent from 14.2 percent. Operating income and margin rate for 2015 decreased primarily due to business mix changes, which resulted in lower volume for mature fixed-price production programs and higher volume for cost-type development programs, as well as less favorable performance on Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs.-28-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Sales$4,825 $4,819 $4,902 — % (2)%Operating income512 514 461 — % 11 %Operating margin rate10.6% 10.7% 9.4% 2016 - Technology Services sales for 2016 were slightly higher than the prior year and reflect higher volume on System Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by lower volume on Advanced Defense Services and Global Logistics and Modernization programs. System Modernization and Services sales increased primarily due to higher volume on U.S. Government health programs. Advanced Defense Services sales declined primarily due to the completion of several programs in 2015, partially offset by higher volume on the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Training Support program (through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results). Global Logistics and Modernization sales decreased principally due to lower volume on the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) program, partially offset by higher volume on the KC-10 program. The increase in KC-10 volume is not indicative of a longer-term trend as we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion. Operating income and margin rate for 2016 were comparable to the prior year.2015 - Technology Services sales for 2015 decreased $83 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2014. The decrease is principally due to lower volume on Global Logistics and Modernization and System Modernization and Services programs. The decrease in Global Logistics and Modernization is mainly due to ramp-down activities on the ICBM program, partially offset by higher volume on intercompany restricted work. System Modernization and Services sales reflect lower volume across a number of programs, partially offset by higher volume on the Total Information Processing Support Services and Social Security Administration IT Support Services programs.Operating income for 2015 increased $53 million, or 11 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 10.7 percent from 9.4 percent. The increase in operating income and margin rate in 2015 reflects improved performance, partially offset by the decline in sales volume described above and lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture than in the prior year period.PRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSISThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2016 2015 2014Segment Information: Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and ExpensesAerospace Systems Product $ 8,868 $ 7,837 $ 7,976 $ 7,025 $ 7,970 $ 6,906Service 1,960 1,755 1,964 1,710 1,940 1,719Mission Systems Product 6,471 5,588 6,448 5,532 6,505 5,478Service 4,457 3,895 4,226 3,732 4,496 3,966Technology Services Product 320 292 358 339 329 356Service 4,505 4,021 4,461 3,966 4,573 4,085Segment Totals Total Product $15,659 $ 13,717 $14,782 $12,896 $14,804 $12,740Total Service 10,922 9,671 10,651 9,408 11,009 9,770Intersegment eliminations (2,073) (1,815) (1,907) (1,698) (1,834) (1,630)Total Segment(1) $24,508 $ 21,573 $23,526 $20,606 $23,979 $20,880(1) A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income, is included in “Segment Operating Results.”-29-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Product Sales and Costs2016 - Product sales for 2016 increased $877 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher product sales at Aerospace Systems due to higher restricted volume, increased F-35 deliveries and production ramp-up on the E-2D program.Product costs for 2016 increased $821 million, or 6 percent, as compared to 2015, consistent with the change in product sales described above. 2015 - Product sales for 2015 were comparable with 2014. Sales in 2014 included the $75 million in settlements at Aerospace Systems as described above and sales in 2015 reflect lower product sales at Mission Systems and higher product sales at Technology Services. The decrease at Mission Systems was primarily due to ramp-down on an international program and lower product sales on certain Cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher F-35 volume. The increase at Technology Services was primarily due to higher volume on intercompany restricted work. Product costs for 2015 increased $156 million, or 1 percent, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher product costs at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems due to lower performance and changes in business mix.Service Sales and Costs2016 - Service sales for 2016 increased $271 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume on several Cyber and ISR and Sensors and Processing service programs at Mission Systems.Service costs for 2016 increased $263 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2015, consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflects higher service margins at Mission Systems, partially offset by lower service margins at Aerospace Systems.2015 - Service sales for 2015 decreased $358 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower service sales at Mission Systems and Technology Services. The decrease at Mission Systems was primarily due to lower volume on certain Advanced Capabilities and unmanned aircraft systems programs, including the impact of in-theater force reductions. The decrease at Technology Services was primarily due to lower service sales on certain SMS programs.Service costs for 2015 decreased $362 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2014, consistent with the change in service sales described above.BACKLOGTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. For multi-year service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 $ in millions Funded Unfunded TotalBacklog TotalBacklog % Change in 2016Aerospace Systems $9,419 $17,891 $27,310 $18,014 52 %Mission Systems 9,301 4,414 13,715 13,254 3 %Technology Services 3,446 868 4,314 4,655 (7)%Total backlog $22,166 $23,173 $45,339 $35,923 26 %Approximately $18.2 billion of the $45.3 billion total backlog at December 31, 2016 is expected to be converted into sales in 2017.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities. In addition to our cash position, we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below. -30-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion, of which $182 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and/or in the capital markets, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditure commitments were $657 million at December 31, 2016, and are expected to be paid with cash on hand.Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes the key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2016 2015 2014Net earnings $2,200 $1,990 $2,069Non-cash items(1) 585 1,035 731Changes in assets and liabilities: Trade working capital (240) (564) (121)Retiree benefits 393 (263) (17)Other, net (125) (36) (69)Net cash provided by operating activities $2,813 $2,162 $2,593(1) Includes depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense (including related excess tax benefits in 2015 and 2014) and deferred income taxes.2016 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 increased by $651 million, or 30 percent, as compared with 2015, principally due to a $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution ($325 million after-tax) made in the first quarter of 2015, changes in trade working capital and an increase in net earnings during 2016, partially offset by an increase in net income tax payments.2015 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 decreased by $431 million, or 17 percent, as compared with 2014, principally due to changes in trade working capital and a $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution ($325 million after-tax) made in the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by lower net tax payments.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities $2,813 $2,162 $2,593 30% (17)%Less: Capital expenditures (920) (471) (561) 95% (16)%Free cash flow $1,893 $1,691 $2,032 12% (17)%2016 – Free cash flow for 2016 increased $202 million, or 12 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was principally driven by the higher net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2016 reflecting $239 million for the purchase of facilities previously leased by Mission Systems and increased capital investment at Aerospace Systems.2015 – Free cash flow for 2015 decreased $341 million, or 17 percent, as compared with 2014. The decrease was principally driven by the lower net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures.-31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Investing Cash Flow2016 - Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 increased $374 million, or 87 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was principally due to the higher capital expenditures described above, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a property at Aerospace Systems and the sale of a commercial cyber security business at Mission Systems.2015 - Net cash used in investing activities for 2015 decreased $214 million, or 33 percent, as compared with 2014. The decrease was principally due to lower capital expenditures and the 2014 acquisition of Qantas Defence Services Pty Limited.Financing Cash Flow2016 - Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 decreased $1.5 billion, or 45 percent, as compared with 2015, principally due to $1.6 billion lower share repurchases, $149 million higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $135 million of borrowings under our credit facilities, partially offset by $321 million in debt repayments.2015 - Net cash used in financing activities during 2015 was comparable with the prior year period and reflects an increase in share repurchases and dividends, offset by $600 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2015.Credit Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes - In December 2016, the company issued $750 million of unsecured senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to fund redemption of $200 million of the company's existing debt. We expect to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including potential pension plan funding and working capital. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes. Financial Arrangements - See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees.Other Sources of Capital - We believe we can obtain additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which allows us to access capital in a timely manner.Share Repurchases - See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs.Contractual ObligationsAt December 31, 2016, we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities. Payments due under these obligations and commitments, and the estimated timing of those payments, are as follows:$ in millions Total 2017 2018- 2019 2020- 2021 2022 and beyondLong-term debt $7,097 $12 $1,420 $834 $4,831Interest payments on long-term debt 4,039 296 585 509 2,649Operating leases 892 257 317 158 160Purchase obligations(1) 8,748 5,009 2,398 1,271 70Other long-term liabilities(2) 1,096 289 342 144 321Total contractual obligations $21,872 $5,863 $5,062 $2,916 $8,031 (1) A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.(2) Other long-term liabilities, including their current portions, primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves, deferred compensation and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which $119 million is related to environmental reserves recorded in other current liabilities. It excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $142 million, as the timing of such payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.-32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans, as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended (ERISA). For further information about future minimum contributions for these plans, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 9 and 11, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are based on U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. In accounting for these contracts, we utilize either the cost-to-cost or the units-of-delivery method of percentage-of-completion accounting, with cost-to-cost being the predominant method.Contract sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to or yet funded by the customer, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Further, as contracts are performed, change orders can be a regular occurrence and may be un-priced until negotiated with the customer. Un-priced change orders, contract claims (including change orders unapproved as to both scope and price) and REAs are included in estimated contract sales when management believes it is probable the un-priced change order, claim and/or REA will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated based on the facts and circumstances known to us at the time.Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract operating margin based on estimated contract sales and cost. Since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. Changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income (loss), see “Consolidated Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are -33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and other post-retirement benefit expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and mortality rate of those covered by our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 4.19 percent at December 31, 2016, and 4.53 percent at December 31, 2015.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied. The accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2016 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2016 pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and 2017 expected pension and other post-retirement expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in RatePension expense$96 $(92)Other post-retirement benefit expense1 (1)Pension obligation1,027 (974)Other post-retirement benefit obligation56 (53)Cash Balance Crediting Rate - A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate. Although current 30-Year Treasury bond rates are near historically low levels, we expect such bond rates to rise in the future. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 3.1 percent as of December 31, 2016, growing to 3.6 percent by 2022. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2016 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2016 pension benefit obligations and 2017 expected pension expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in RatePension expense$(26) $27Pension obligation(132) 134-34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including historical asset returns, the plan’s target asset allocation, and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other post-retirement benefits; however, we reduce the EROA for other post-retirement benefit plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts are taxable.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2016 is 11.1 percent and our 20-year rolling average rate of return is 8.2 percent, each determined on an arithmetic basis. Our 2016 asset returns were approximately 7.7 percent.With regard to the company's investment policy, during 2016, the Benefit Plans Investment Committee reviewed and re-affirmed the major asset class allocations. Our asset allocation is approximately 45% equities, 35% fixed-income and 20% alternatives and we are not currently contemplating significant changes to that investment mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.For determining FAS expense in 2016 and 2015, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent for both 2016 and 2015 and an expected long-term rate of return on other post-retirement benefit plan assets of 7.7 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. For 2017 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and 7.7 percent on other post-retirement benefit plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2016 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017 pension and other post-retirement benefit expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease 25 Basis Point IncreasePension expense$59 $(59)Other post-retirement benefit expense3 (3)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values, as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2015, the SOA issued an updated mortality improvement scale which further refined the previous scale based on additional data and which generally contained lower mortality improvement projections. In October 2016, the SOA issued another updated mortality improvement scale which generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the prior scales. In consideration of this information, we studied our historical mortality experience and developed an expectation for continued future mortality improvements based on the most recent SOA table, but with a long-term improvement rate of 0.75% versus 1.0% assumed by the SOA. Based on this data, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recognized at December 31, 2016, and the amounts estimated for our 2017 pension and post-retirement benefit expense. -35-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION For further information regarding our pension and post-retirement benefits, see “Risk Factors” and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management's assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters - We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 10 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.GoodwillOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.-36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION OTHER MATTERSOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2016, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. For a description of our operating leases, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.-37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and available-for-sale marketable securities with a fair value of $330 million at December 31, 2016. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term borrowings under our credit facilities for which there was £110 million (the equivalent of approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2016) outstanding at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we have $7.1 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $7.6 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2016, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $147 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2016, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.-38-",2023-12-30 20:38:58.470605
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWPending Acquisition of Orbital ATKOn September 17, 2017, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Orbital ATK, Inc. (Orbital ATK) for approximately $7.8 billion in cash, plus the assumption of approximately $1.4 billion in net debt (the “Orbital ATK Acquisition”). See Item 1.01 in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 18, 2017 for a summary and copy of the merger agreement. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, create value for shareholders, provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees and enhance our ability to provide innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Orbital ATK shareholders are to receive all-cash consideration of $134.50 per share. We expect to fund the Orbital ATK Acquisition with the proceeds from our debt financing completed in October 2017 and cash on hand. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our Orbital ATK Acquisition financing. On November 29, 2017, Orbital ATK shareholders approved the proposed Orbital ATK Acquisition. We currently expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2018, after receiving regulatory approvals. Upon completion of the Orbital ATK Acquisition, we plan to establish Orbital ATK as a new, fourth business sector named Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. U.S. Tax ReformIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act represents major tax reform legislation that, among other provisions, reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate. Certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including $300 million of tax expense recorded principally due to the write-down of our net deferred tax assets, are reflected in our financial results in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides SEC staff guidance regarding the application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act became law. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 Tax Act.Global Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions and diverse regional security concerns. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities.The global economic environment also continues to be marked by uncertainty, instability and geopolitical tensions. Global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2018, reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility. The global economy may also be affected by Britain’s exit from the European Union, the impact of which is not known at this time. Global economic conditions could impact customer purchasing decisions. U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA) provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. Part II mandated substantial additional reductions, through a process known as “sequestration,” which took effect in March 2013.On November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the Budget Act). The Budget Act raised the debt ceiling until March 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the BCA by $80 billion, split equally between defense and non-defense discretionary spending in the Government’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 ($50 billion in FY 2016 and $30 billion in FY 2017). Sequestration spending caps under the BCA could reduce defense spending again in FY 2018. On February 9, 2016, the President delivered his FY 2017 budget to Congress. The FY 2017 budget reflected the FY 2017 spending caps established in the Budget Act and requested $583 billion for the DoD’s annual budget, including $59 billion for OCO. The President signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016 and provided funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.In March 2017, the debt ceiling was reached and the Treasury Department began taking “extraordinary measures” to finance the government and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling. On September 8, 2017, the debt ceiling was suspended for three months and on December 9, 2017, the Treasury Department again began taking extraordinary -24-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION measures to finance the government. It is expected that the Treasury Department will run out of the ability to take extraordinary measures to finance the government in the first half of 2018.In May 2017, the President signed into law the FY 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act. In total for FY 2017, Congress appropriated $524 billion in base discretionary funding for the DoD, consistent with the Budget Act. Congress also appropriated approximately $68 billion in OCO funding and approximately $15 billion in additional DoD appropriations. In May 2017, the President released his FY 2018 budget request, which seeks $575 billion for the DoD’s base budget, approximately $52 billion above the statutory caps provided for in the BCA. The President’s budget request also seeks an additional $65 billion in OCO funding for expeditionary needs, not capped by the BCA. On September 8, 2017, the President signed a continuing resolution which generally funded the government at FY 2017 levels through December 8, 2017. The continuing resolution was extended to December 22, 2017 and further extended to January 19, 2018. As Congress did not enact appropriations legislation or a new continuing resolution by January 19, 2018, on January 20, 2018, the U.S. Government temporarily shut down. On January 22, 2018, a fourth continuing resolution was enacted, which funds the government through February 8, 2018.The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the company's programs in particular.

We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts primarily using the cost-to-cost method of percentage of completion accounting, but in some cases we utilize the units-of-delivery method of percentage of completion accounting. As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred and units delivered across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules that govern our U.S. Government business and related Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), most types of costs are allocable to U.S. Government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our three segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, deliveries or other indicators of sales activity. Changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels or delivery rates. Performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or lifecycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).-25-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSSelected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts2017 2016 2015 20172016Sales$25,803 $24,508 $23,526 5 % 4 %Operating costs and expenses22,504 21,315 20,450 6 % 4 %Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales87.2% 87.0% 86.9% Operating income3,299 3,193 3,076 3 % 4 %Operating margin rate12.8% 13.0% 13.1% Federal and foreign income tax expense1,034 723 800 43 % (10)%Effective income tax rate33.9% 24.7% 28.7% Net earnings2,015 2,200 1,990 (8)% 11 %Diluted earnings per share11.47 12.19 10.39 (6)% 17 %Sales2017 – Sales increased $1.3 billion, or 5 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.2016 – Sales increased $982 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.See “Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sales by customer category. See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail.Operating Income2017 – Operating income increased $106 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to a $278 million increase in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and a $24 million increase in segment operating income, partially offset by a $197 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses, as described in “Segment Operating Results.” Higher operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales reduced our operating margin rate to 12.8 percent from 13.0 percent in the prior year period and was driven by the increase in unallocated corporate expenses and a lower segment operating margin rate, as described in “Segment Operating Results,” partially offset by the increase in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment.G&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.3 percent in 2017 from 10.5 percent in 2016, principally due to higher sales volume.2016 – Operating income increased $117 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to a $137 million reduction in unallocated corporate expenses and higher sales volume, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and lower segment margin rates. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2016 as compared with 2015, which reduced our operating margin rate to 13.0 percent from 13.1 percent in the prior year period. The decrease in operating margin rate was driven by a lower segment operating margin rate and a $32 million decrease in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, partially offset by a $137 million reduction in unallocated corporate expenses, as described in “Segment Operating Results.”G&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.5 percent in 2016 from 10.9 percent in 2015, principally due to higher sales volume.For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.Federal and Foreign Income Taxes2017 – Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 33.9 percent, as compared with 24.7 percent in 2016. The higher rate is principally due to $300 million of tax expense recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act, largely due to the write-down of net deferred tax assets, partially offset by a $69 million increase in research credits and a $39 million benefit recognized for additional manufacturing deductions principally related to prior years. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 each include separate approximately $40 million benefits -26-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION recognized in connection with the resolution of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations of the company’s prior year tax returns.2016 – Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 24.7 percent, as compared with 28.7 percent in 2015. The lower rate is principally due to $85 million of excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payment transactions recognized in 2016, a $40 million benefit recognized in connection with resolution of the IRS examination of the company’s 2007-2011 tax returns and a $33 million benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by a $58 million decrease in research credits, which were principally a result of credits recorded in 2015 that were claimed on our prior year tax returns.Net Earnings2017 – Net earnings for 2017 decreased $185 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to the higher effective tax rate discussed above and higher interest expense resulting from our debt issuance in October 2017, as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These decreases were partially offset by higher operating income and an increase in Other, net as a result of gains on the sale of two investments and higher interest income on short-term investments.2016 – Net earnings for 2016 increased $210 million, or 11 percent, as compared with 2015, primarily due to the higher operating income and lower effective tax rate discussed above.Diluted Earnings Per Share2017 – Diluted earnings per share for 2017 decreased $0.72, or 6 percent, as compared with 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the 8 percent decline in net earnings discussed above, partially offset by a 3 percent reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding resulting principally from shares repurchased during 2016.2016 – Diluted earnings per share for 2016 increased $1.80, or 17 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase is primarily due to the 11 percent increase in net earnings discussed above and a 6 percent reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased during 2015 and 2016.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationThe company is aligned in three operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Mission Systems and Technology Services. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aerospace Systems Mission Systems Technology ServicesAutonomous Systems Sensors and Processing Global Logistics and ModernizationManned Aircraft Cyber and ISR Advanced Defense ServicesSpace Advanced Capabilities System Modernization and ServicesThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. -27-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income section below, is a non-GAAP measure that reflects total earnings from our three segments, including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

The higher operating income includes a $56 million favorable EAC adjustment at Aerospace Systems on a restricted program largely related to performance incentives and $54 million recognized to date in connection with a claim related to certain costs incurred in prior years (the “Cost Claim”). Segment operating margin rate decreased to 11.5 percent from 12.0 percent in 2016 principally due to lower segment margin rates at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by a higher segment margin rate at Technology Services.2016 - Segment operating income for 2016 increased $15 million, or 1 percent, as compared with 2015 as a result of higher sales volume, which more than offset the lower segment operating margin rate. Segment operating margin rate decreased to 12.0 percent from 12.4 percent in 2015 principally due to a lower segment margin rate at Aerospace Systems. Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income - The table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as well as unallocated corporate expenses (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS or the FAR). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses.

The increase in CAS expense relates to the continued phase-in of CAS harmonization and the impact of actual demographic experience, partially offset by a change in our mortality assumption as of December 31, 2016. The reduction in FAS expense was principally driven by our year-end 2016 FAS pension assumptions, including the noted change in our mortality assumption offset by a lower discount rate. 2016 - The decrease in net FAS/CAS pension adjustment is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns during 2015, partially offset by the increase in our FAS discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2015 and the continued phase-in of CAS harmonization.2017 - Unallocated corporate expenses increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to $47 million of costs associated with the Orbital ATK Acquisition and $41 million of deferred state tax expense resulting from state tax adjustments associated with the filing of our prior year federal tax return and the company's $500 million discretionary pension contribution in December 2017. In addition, the prior year period included a $35 million -28-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION benefit recognized for state tax refunds claimed on our prior year tax returns and a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries.2016 - Unallocated corporate expenses declined in 2016, as compared to 2015. In 2016, unallocated corporate expenses included a $35 million benefit recognized for state tax refunds claimed on our prior year tax returns and a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries. In 2015, unallocated corporate expenses included a $45 million expense recognized for deferred state income taxes due to a change in accounting methods approved by the IRS that lowered our deductions for domestic production activities and a $25 million expense recognized for deferred state income taxes resulting from a discretionary pension contribution. Net Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2017 2016 2015Favorable EAC adjustments$668 $765 $924Unfavorable EAC adjustments(305) (271) (344)Net EAC adjustments$363 $ 494 $ 580Net EAC adjustments by segment are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2017 2016 2015Aerospace Systems$246 $263 $352Mission Systems79 191 169Technology Services51 69 68Eliminations(13) (29) (9)Net EAC adjustments$363 $494 $580For purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this Segment Operating Results section, references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate, respectively.AEROSPACE SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Sales$11,955 $10,828 $9,940 10% 9%Operating income1,259 1,236 1,205 2% 3%Operating margin rate10.5% 11.4% 12.1% 2017 - Aerospace Systems sales for 2017 increased $1.1 billion, or 10 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs. Manned Aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted sales. Autonomous Systems sales increased principally due to higher volume for several programs, including Triton, partially offset by lower NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) volume. Space sales increased primarily due to higher restricted sales, partially offset by lower volume on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) programs. Operating income for 2017 increased $23 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 10.5 percent from 11.4 percent principally due to changes in contract mix on Manned Aircraft programs and a gain of $45 million recognized in the prior year associated with the sale of a property, partially offset by the previously discussed $56 million favorable EAC adjustment largely related to performance incentives.2016 - Aerospace Systems sales for 2016 increased $888 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was due to higher volume on Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. Manned Aircraft sales increased primarily due to higher restricted volume, increased F-35 deliveries and production ramp-up on the E-2D program. -29-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION These increases were partially offset by lower B-2 volume and fewer F/A-18 deliveries. Autonomous Systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the Triton and Global Hawk programs, partially offset by ramp-down of the NATO AGS program. Space sales include higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by lower volume on the AEHF program.Operating income for 2016 increased $31 million, or 3 percent, and includes a gain of $45 million associated with the sale of a property. Higher sales volume and improved performance on Space and Autonomous Systems programs were more than offset by lower margins on Manned Aircraft programs, principally due to changes in contract mix and the timing of risk reductions. Operating margin rate decreased to 11.4 percent from 12.1 percent primarily due to the lower margins on Manned Aircraft programs, partially offset by improved performance on Space and Autonomous Systems programs.MISSION SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Sales$11,382 $10,928 $10,674 4% 2%Operating income1,453 1,445 1,410 1% 2%Operating margin rate12.8% 13.2% 13.2% 2017 - Mission Systems sales for 2017 increased $454 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher Sensors and Processing volume, partially offset by lower Cyber and ISR volume. Sensors and Processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on F-35 sensors, electro-optical/infrared self-protection and targeting programs, communications programs and the Scalable Agile Beam Radar program. These increases were partially offset by lower volume on international ground-based radar programs. Cyber and ISR sales decreased primarily due to lower volume on ISR and restricted programs. Operating income for 2017 increased $8 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to higher sales and $32 million recognized in connection with the Cost Claim described above, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 12.8 percent from 13.2 percent primarily due to lower margin rates on Sensors and Processing and Cyber and ISR programs principally resulting from lower performance and changes in contract mix. This decrease was partially offset by improved margin rates at Advanced Capabilities primarily due to the prior year including a $49 million forward loss provision on an Advanced Capabilities program as described below.2016 - Mission Systems sales for 2016 increased $254 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2015 due to higher volume on Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by lower volume on Cyber and ISR programs. Sensors and Processing sales increased primarily due to higher volume on communications programs, including the Joint Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare program; increased restricted volume and ramp-up on the G/ATOR program. These increases were partially offset by lower volume on international programs. Advanced Capabilities sales increased primarily due to higher volume on restricted, maritime systems and marine systems programs. Cyber and ISR sales reflect lower volume on space programs.Operating income for 2016 increased $35 million, or 2 percent, due to the higher sales volume described above and a $21 million gain associated with the sale of a commercial cyber security product business, partially offset by a $49 million forward loss provision recorded on an Advanced Capabilities program principally due to cost growth for changes impacting fixed-price options, which may not be fully recovered through additional contract value. Operating margin rate for 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015 and reflects improved performance on Sensors and Processing programs, partially offset by lower margins on Advanced Capabilities programs.TECHNOLOGY SERVICES Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Sales$4,750 $4,825 $4,819 (2)% — %Operating income524 512 514 2 % — %Operating margin rate11.0% 10.6% 10.7% 2017 - Technology Services sales for 2017 decreased $75 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower volume on System Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by higher volume on Global -30-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Logistics and Modernization programs. System Modernization and Services sales decreased principally due to the completion of several programs in 2016 and 2017. Global Logistics and Modernization sales increased primarily due to higher intercompany volume and increased sales on the UKAWACS and Hunter programs, partially offset by lower volume on the KC-10 program as our contract nears completion.Operating income for 2017 increased $12 million, or 2 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 11.0 percent from 10.6 percent primarily due to improved performance across the sector.2016 - Technology Services sales for 2016 were slightly higher than the prior year and reflect higher volume on System Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by lower volume on Advanced Defense Services and Global Logistics and Modernization programs. System Modernization and Services sales increased primarily due to higher volume on U.S. Government health programs. Advanced Defense Services sales declined primarily due to the completion of several programs in 2015, partially offset by higher volume on the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Training Support program (through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results). Global Logistics and Modernization sales decreased principally due to lower volume on the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program, partially offset by higher volume on the KC-10 program.Operating income and margin rate for 2016 were comparable to the prior year.PRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSISThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2017 2016 2015Segment Information: Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and ExpensesAerospace Systems Product $ 9,841 $ 8,796 $ 8,868 $ 7,837 $ 7,976 $ 7,025Service 2,114 1,900 1,960 1,755 1,964 1,710Mission Systems Product 6,907 5,981 6,471 5,588 6,448 5,532Service 4,475 3,948 4,457 3,895 4,226 3,732Technology Services Product 392 360 320 292 358 339Service 4,358 3,866 4,505 4,021 4,461 3,966Segment Totals Total Product $17,140 $ 15,137 $15,659 $13,717 $14,782 $12,896Total Service 10,947 9,714 10,922 9,671 10,651 9,408Intersegment eliminations (2,284) (2,007) (2,073) (1,815) (1,907) (1,698)Total Segment(1) $25,803 $ 22,844 $24,508 $21,573 $23,526 $20,606(1) A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “Segment Operating Results.”Product Sales and Costs2017 - Product sales for 2017 increased $1.5 billion, or 9 percent, as compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Higher Aerospace Systems product sales were primarily driven by increased restricted volume, partially offset by lower volume on the JWST and NATO AGS programs. The increase at Mission Systems was principally due to higher product volume on F-35 sensors, EO/IR self-protection and targeting programs and the SABR program.Product costs for 2017 increased $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, as compared to 2016. The increase principally reflects a lower product margin rate at Aerospace Systems due to changes in contract mix.2016 - Product sales for 2016 increased $877 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher product sales at Aerospace Systems due to higher restricted volume, increased F-35 deliveries and production ramp-up on the E-2D program.-31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Product costs for 2016 increased $821 million, or 6 percent, as compared to 2015, consistent with the change in product sales described above. Service Sales and Costs2017 - Service sales for 2017 were comparable with 2016. Higher service sales at Aerospace Systems on several Autonomous Systems and Manned Aircraft programs were offset by lower service volume principally on the KC-10 program at Technology Services.Service costs for 2017 were comparable with 2016, consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflect lower service margins at Mission Systems, partially offset by higher service margins at Technology Services principally due to improved performance across the sector.2016 - Service sales for 2016 increased $271 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume on several Cyber and ISR and Sensors and Processing service programs at Mission Systems.Service costs for 2016 increased $263 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2015, consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflects higher service margins at Mission Systems, partially offset by lower service margins at Aerospace Systems.BACKLOGTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. For multi-year service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 $ in millions Funded Unfunded TotalBacklog TotalBacklog % Change in 2017Aerospace Systems $9,335 $15,687 $25,022 $27,310 (8)%Mission Systems 10,241 3,790 14,031 13,715 2 %Technology Services 2,797 1,028 3,825 4,314 (11)%Total backlog $22,373 $20,505 $42,878 $45,339 (5)%Approximately $20.3 billion of the $42.9 billion total backlog at December 31, 2017 is expected to be converted into sales in 2018.OTHEROn July 18, 2017, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals made public its decision that the government improperly required Northrop Grumman to treat $253 million of its post-retirement benefit costs as unallowable for government contract cost accounting purposes. The decision, if upheld on any potential appeal, would only apply to certain contracts spanning a 20-year period.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities. In addition to our cash position, we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 billion; approximately $200 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and/or in the capital markets, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditure commitments were $492 million at December 31, 2017, and are expected to be paid with cash on hand.On September 17, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Orbital ATK for approximately $7.8 billion in cash, plus the assumption of approximately $1.4 billion in net debt. In October 2017, the company -32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes and intends to use the net proceeds, as well as cash on hand, to finance the Orbital ATK Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. See Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2017 2016 2015Net earnings $2,015 $2,200 $1,990Non-cash items(1) 1,172 585 1,035Changes in assets and liabilities: Trade working capital (340) (240) (564)Retiree benefits (191) 393 (263)Other, net (43) (125) (36)Net cash provided by operating activities $2,613 $2,813 $2,162(1) Includes deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense (including related excess tax benefits in 2015).2017 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 decreased by $200 million, or 7 percent, as compared with 2016, principally due to a $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution ($325 million after-tax) made in December 2017.2016 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 increased by $651 million, or 30 percent, as compared with 2015, principally due to a $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution ($325 million after-tax) made in the first quarter of 2015, changes in trade working capital and an increase in net earnings during 2016, partially offset by an increase in net income tax payments.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Net cash provided by operating activities $2,613 $2,813 $2,162 (7)% 30%Less: capital expenditures (928) (920) (471) 1 % 95%Free cash flow $1,685 $1,893 $1,691 (11)% 12%2017 – Free cash flow for 2017 decreased $208 million, or 11 percent, as compared with 2016. The decrease was principally driven by the $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution discussed above.2016 – Free cash flow for 2016 increased $202 million, or 12 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was principally driven by the higher net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2016 reflecting $239 million for the purchase of facilities previously leased by Mission Systems and increased capital investment at Aerospace Systems.Investing Cash Flow2017 - Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 increased $84 million, or 10 percent, as compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds from the 2016 sales of a property at Aerospace Systems and a commercial cyber security business at Mission Systems, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of two investments in 2017.-33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 2016 - Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 increased $374 million, or 87 percent, as compared with 2015. The increase was principally due to the higher capital expenditures described above, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a property at Aerospace Systems and the sale of a commercial cyber security business at Mission Systems.Financing Cash Flow2017 - Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $7.0 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.8 billion in 2016. The change is principally due to $7.5 billion higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $1.2 billion lower share repurchases in 2017.2016 - Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 decreased $1.5 billion, or 45 percent, as compared with 2015, principally due to $1.6 billion lower share repurchases, $149 million higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $135 million of borrowings under our credit facilities, partially offset by $321 million in debt repayments.Share Repurchases - See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs.Credit Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes - See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes. Financial Arrangements - See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees.Other Sources of Capital - We believe we can obtain additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which allows us to access capital in a timely manner.Contractual ObligationsAt December 31, 2017, we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities. Payments due under these obligations and commitments, and the estimated timing of those payments, are as follows:$ in millions Total 2018 2019- 2020 2021- 2022 2023 and beyondLong-term debt $15,350 $867 $1,563 $2,339 $10,581Interest payments on long-term debt 7,705 530 1,069 955 5,151Operating leases 1,338 232 340 207 559Purchase obligations(1) 9,772 5,396 3,187 458 731Other long-term liabilities(2) 1,187 302 376 132 377Total contractual obligations $35,352 $7,327 $6,535 $4,091 $17,399 (1) A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.(2) Other long-term liabilities, including their current portions, primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves, deferred compensation and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which $148 million is related to environmental reserves recorded in other current liabilities. It excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $294 million, as the timing of such payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans, as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended. For further information about future minimum contributions for these plans, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 10 and 12, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.-34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are based on GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. In accounting for these contracts, we utilize either the cost-to-cost or the units-of-delivery method of percentage-of-completion accounting, with cost-to-cost being the predominant method.Contract sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to or yet funded by the customer, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Further, as contracts are performed, change orders can be a regular occurrence and may be un-priced until negotiated with the customer. Un-priced change orders, contract claims (including change orders unapproved as to both scope and price) and REAs are included in estimated contract sales when management believes it is probable the un-priced change order, claim and/or REA will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated considering the facts and circumstances known to us at the time.Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract operating margin based on estimated contract sales and cost. Since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. Changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.New Revenue StandardEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the full retrospective method. Topic 606 supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance, including ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts, and outlines a single set of comprehensive principles for recognizing revenue under GAAP. Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized as control transfers to the customer. As such, under the new standard, revenue for our contracts is generally recognized over time using the cost-to-cost method, which is consistent with the revenue recognition model used for the majority of our contracts prior to the adoption of Topic 606. In most cases the accounting for those contracts where we previously recognized revenue as units were delivered has changed under Topic 606 such that we now recognize revenue as costs are incurred. This change generally results in an acceleration of revenue as -35-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION compared with our previous revenue recognition method for those contracts. In addition, for certain of our contracts, there is a change in the number of performance obligations under Topic 606, which has altered the timing of revenue and margin recognition. See “Accounting Standards Updates” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of Topic 606.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and other post-retirement benefit expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 3.68 percent at December 31, 2017, and 4.19 percent at December 31, 2016.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied. The accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2017 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017 pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and 2018 expected pension and other post-retirement expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in RatePension expense$96 $(92)Other post-retirement benefit expense1 (1)Pension obligation1,096 (1,039)Other post-retirement benefit obligation57 (54)Cash Balance Crediting Rate - A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate. Although current 30-Year Treasury bond rates are near historically low levels, we expect such bond rates to rise in the future. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 2.75 percent as of December 31, 2017, growing to 3.0 percent by 2023. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2017 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017 pension benefit obligations and 2018 expected pension expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in RatePension expense$(26) $27Pension obligation(135) 141Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA -36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including historical asset returns, the plan’s target asset allocation, and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other post-retirement benefits; however, we reduce the EROA for other post-retirement benefit plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2017 was approximately 11.3 percent and our 20-year rolling average rate of return was approximately 8.1 percent, each determined on an arithmetic basis. Our 2017 asset returns, net of expenses, were approximately 16.4 percent.With regard to the company’s investment policy, during 2017, the Benefit Plans Investment Committee reviewed and re-affirmed the major asset class allocations. Our asset allocation is approximately 45% equities, 35% fixed-income and 20% alternatives and we are not currently contemplating significant changes to that investment mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.For determining FAS expense in 2017 and 2016, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent for both 2017 and 2016 and an expected long-term rate of return on other post-retirement benefit plan assets of 7.7 percent for both 2017 and 2016. For 2018 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and 7.7 percent on other post-retirement benefit plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2017 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2018 pension and other post-retirement benefit expense:$ increase/(decrease) in millions25 Basis Point Decrease 25 Basis Point IncreasePension expense$66 $(66)Other post-retirement benefit expense3 (3)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values, as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. The SOA has issued annual updates to their mortality improvement scale each year since then as additional data has become available. These updates generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the original projections from 2014. After considering the additional information released by the SOA in October 2017, and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience, we continued our practice of adopting the latest SOA projection scale, but with a long-term improvement rate of 0.75% versus 1.0% assumed by the SOA. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recognized at December 31, 2017, and the amounts estimated for our 2018 pension and post-retirement benefit expense. For further information regarding our pension and post-retirement benefits, see “Risk Factors” and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.-37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters - We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.GoodwillOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.-38-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION OTHER MATTERSOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2017, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. For a description of our operating leases, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.-39-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and available-for-sale marketable securities with a fair value of $353 million at December 31, 2017. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate, short-term borrowings under our credit facilities, for which there was £100 million (the equivalent of approximately $134 million as of December 31, 2017) outstanding at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, we have $15.3 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $16.0 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2017, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $89 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2017, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.-40-",2023-12-30 20:39:00.400930
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWAs previously announced, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, using the full retrospective method.Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we changed our GAAP accounting method related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPB) plans (the “Accounting change”). Prior to the Accounting change, actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income upon annual remeasurement and were amortized into earnings in future periods on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceeded the accounting corridor, a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required. Under the new method, actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in net periodic benefit cost through Mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) (expense) benefit upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.Our 2017 and 2016 results below have been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07 and the Accounting change as described in Notes 1, 13, 16, 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.Acquisition of Orbital ATKOn June 6, 2018 (the “Merger Date”), the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Orbital ATK, Inc. (“Orbital ATK”) (the “Merger”), by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Orbital ATK for a purchase price of $7.7 billion in cash. On the Merger date, Orbital ATK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, Inc. We established Innovation Systems as a new, fourth business sector, whose main products include launch vehicles and related propulsion systems; missile products and defense electronics; precision weapons, armament systems and ammunition; satellites and associated space components and services; and advanced aerospace structures. The acquisition was financed with proceeds from the company’s debt financing completed in October 2017 and cash on hand. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements, create value for shareholders and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Orbital ATK.Global Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities.The global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty. Geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2019, reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility. The global economy may also be affected by Britain’s anticipated exit from the European Union, the full impact of which is not known at this time. Additionally, economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a ten-year period (FY 2012 through FY 2021), including specific limits for defense and non-defense spending. In prior years, these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years. Most recently, on February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2018, which raised the statutory budget caps for defense spending, including for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), by $80 billion for FY 2018 and by $85 billion for FY 2019. The BBA also raised non-defense spending by $63 billion for FY 2018 and $68 billion for FY 2019 and suspended the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. The original spending caps -25-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION established by the BCA will return for FY 2020 and FY 2021 without another statutory change. Similarly, the suspension of the debt ceiling is expected to end on March 1, 2019 absent further action. On March 23, 2018, the President signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY 2018, which provided $1.3 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies. In total for FY 2018, Congress appropriated approximately $700 billion for national security, including approximately $630 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately $70 billion in OCO funding. On September 28, 2018, full-year appropriations for FY 2019 were enacted representing over half of discretionary federal spending. For FY 2019, Congress appropriated approximately $716 billion for national security, including approximately $647 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately $69 billion in OCO funding. A continuing resolution was approved to provide further funding for other agencies (including NASA and other civil agencies) through December 7, 2018, which was subsequently extended through December 21, 2018. On December 22, 2018, U.S. government agencies that had not yet received full-year appropriations and did not otherwise have funding entered into a temporary shutdown. On January 25, 2019, a third continuing resolution was enacted, which funds these agencies through February 15, 2019.The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules that govern our U.S. government business and related Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or lifecycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our financial and operating performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts, and are described as MTM-adjusted net earnings and MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.-26-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts2018 2017 2016 20182017Sales$30,095 $26,004 $24,706 16 % 5 %Operating costs and expenses26,315 22,786 21,429 15 % 6 %Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales87.4% 87.6% 86.7% Operating income3,780 3,218 3,277 17 % (2)%Operating margin rate12.6% 12.4% 13.3% Mark-to-market pension and OPB (expense) benefit(655) 536 (950) NM NMFederal and foreign income tax expense513 1,360 638 (62)% 113 %Effective income tax rate13.7% 32.2% 23.8% Net earnings3,229 2,869 2,043 13 % 40 %Diluted earnings per share18.49 16.34 11.32 13 % 44 %Sales2018 – Sales increased $4.1 billion, or 16 percent, as compared with 2017, due to the addition of $3.3 billion of sales from Innovation Systems and higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Technology Services.2017 – Sales increased $1.3 billion, or 5 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. Operating Income and Margin Rate2018 – Operating income increased $562 million, or 17 percent, as compared with 2017, primarily due to a $544 million increase in segment operating income, which includes the addition of $343 million of operating income from Innovation Systems, and a $42 million decrease in unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in our net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment, all of which are further discussed in “Segment Operating Results.” Lower operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased our operating margin rate to 12.6 percent from 12.4 percent in the prior year period and was principally driven by a higher segment operating margin rate, as described in “Segment Operating Results,” and the previously noted decrease in unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by the decrease in our net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment.G&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.0 percent in 2018 from 10.4 percent in 2017, principally due to higher sales volume.2017 – Operating income for 2017 decreased $59 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to a $280 million increase in unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by a $181 million increase in our net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment and a $39 million increase in segment operating income, all of which are further discussed in “Segment Operating Results.” Higher operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales reduced our operating margin rate to 12.4 percent from 13.3 percent in the prior year period and principally was driven by the previously noted increase in unallocated corporate expense and a lower segment operating margin rate, as described in “Segment Operating Results,” partially offset by the increase in our net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment.G&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.4 percent in 2017 from 10.7 percent in 2016, principally due to higher sales volume.For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.-27-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Mark-to-Market Pension and OPB Adjustment The primary components of pre-tax MTM (expense) benefit are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2018 2017 2016Actuarial gains (losses) on projected benefit obligation$2,772 $(1,570) $(988)Actuarial (losses) gains on plan assets (3,426) 2,119 25Other(1) (13) 13MTM (expense) benefit$(655) $536 $(950)2018 – MTM expense of $655 million in 2018 was primarily driven by actual net plan asset losses of approximately 3.5 percent, partially offset by actuarial gains principally resulting from a 63 basis point increase in the discount rate. In 2017, we recognized a MTM benefit of $536 million as described below.2017 – MTM benefit of $536 million in 2017 was primarily driven by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 16.4 percent, partially offset by actuarial losses principally resulting from a 51 basis point decrease in the discount rate. MTM expense of $950 million in 2016 was primarily driven by actuarial losses largely resulting from a 34 basis point decrease in the discount rate.Federal and Foreign Income Taxes2018 – Our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than 2017 primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.2017 – Our effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than 2016 primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.Net EarningsThe table below reconciles net earnings to MTM-adjusted net earnings: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Net earnings$3,229 $2,869 $2,043 13% 40 %MTM expense (benefit)655 (536) 950 NM NMMTM-related deferred state tax (benefit) expense(1)(29) 24 (43) NM NMFederal tax (benefit) expense of items above(2)(131) 108 (317) NM NMMTM adjustment, net of tax495 (404) 590 NM NMMTM-adjusted net earnings$3,724 $2,465 $2,633 51% (6)%(1) Deferred state taxes are recorded in unallocated corporate expense within operating income.

Excluding these impacts, MTM-adjusted net earnings increased by $1.3 billion, or 51 percent, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate described above, $544 million of higher segment operating income, and a $350 million increase in our net FAS (non-service) pension benefit. These increases were partially offset by $202 million of higher interest expense. 2017 – Net earnings for 2017 increased $826 million, or 40 percent, as compared with 2016, and includes a $1 billion increase related to impacts associated with our MTM adjustment, net of tax. Excluding these items, MTM-adjusted net earnings decreased by $168 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to the higher effective tax rate noted above and $59 million of higher interest expense resulting from our debt issuance in October 2017, as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $92 million increase in Other, net as a result of gains on the sale of two investments and higher interest income on short-term investments as well as an $88 million increase in our net FAS (non-service) pension benefit.-28-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Diluted Earnings Per ShareThe table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31 % Change in 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Diluted earnings per share$18.49 $16.34 $11.32 13% 44 %MTM expense (benefit) per share3.76 (3.06) 5.27 NM NMMTM-related deferred state tax (benefit) expense per share(1)(0.17) 0.14 (0.24) NM NMFederal tax (benefit) expense of items above per share(2)(0.75) 0.62 (1.76) NM NMMTM adjustment per share, net of tax2.84 (2.30) 3.27 NM NMMTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share$21.33 $14.04 $14.59 52% (4)%(1) Deferred state taxes are recorded in unallocated corporate expense within operating income.(2) Based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and a 35% federal statutory tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016.2018 – Diluted earnings per share for 2018 increased $2.15, or 13 percent, as compared with 2017, and includes a $5.14 reduction related to impacts associated with our MTM adjustment, net of tax. Excluding these impacts, MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share increased $7.29, or 52 percent, primarily due to the 51 percent increase in MTM-adjusted net earnings discussed above.2017 – Diluted earnings per share for 2017 increased $5.02, or 44 percent, as compared with 2016, and includes a $5.57 increase related to impacts associated with our MTM adjustment, net of tax. Excluding these items, MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased $0.55, or 4 percent, primarily due to the 6 percent decline in MTM-adjusted net earnings discussed above, partially offset by a 3 percent reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding resulting principally from shares repurchased during 2016.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Innovation Systems, Mission Systems and Technology Services. As described above, on the effective date of the Merger, we established Innovation Systems as a new, fourth business sector. The segment operating results below include sales and operating income for Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger date. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aerospace Systems Innovation Systems Mission Systems Technology ServicesAutonomous Systems Defense Systems Advanced Capabilities Advanced Defense ServicesManned Aircraft Flight Systems Cyber and ISR Global Logistics and ModernizationSpace Space Systems Sensors and Processing System Modernization and ServicesThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. -29-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income section below, is a non-GAAP measure that reflects total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. This non-GAAP measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

The higher operating income includes $69 million of favorable EAC adjustments on multiple restricted programs at Aerospace Systems. Segment operating margin rate increased to 11.5 percent from 11.2 percent in 2017 principally due to higher segment margin rates at each of the legacy Northrop Grumman sectors.2017 – Segment operating income for 2017 increased $39 million, or 1 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher operating income at Aerospace Systems, partially offset by lower operating income at Mission Systems and Technology Services. The higher operating income includes a $56 million favorable EAC adjustment at Aerospace Systems on a restricted program largely related to performance incentives and $54 million recognized in connection with a claim related to certain costs incurred in prior years (the “2017 Cost Claim”). Segment operating margin rate decreased to 11.2 percent from 11.6 percent in 2016 principally due to lower segment margin rates at Mission Systems and Aerospace Systems.Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Total Operating Income - The table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment, as well as unallocated corporate expenses (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS or FAR, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expense.

Manned Aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted and F-35 volume. Autonomous Systems sales reflect higher volume on several programs, including Triton, partially offset by lower Global Hawk volume. Space sales reflect higher restricted and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Technology Maturation Risk Reduction volume, partially offset by lower intercompany and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) volume. Operating income for 2018 increased $122 million, or 9 percent, primarily due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate. Operating margin rate increased to 10.8 percent from 10.6 percent principally due to improved performance, including the previously noted $69 million of favorable EAC adjustments on multiple restricted programs in 2018, partially offset by the $56 million favorable EAC adjustment recorded in 2017.2017 – Aerospace Systems sales for 2017 increased $1.3 billion, or 12 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs. Manned Aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted sales. Autonomous Systems sales increased principally due to higher volume for several programs, including Triton, partially offset by lower NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) volume. Space sales increased primarily due to higher restricted sales, partially offset by lower volume on the JWST and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) programs.Operating income for 2017 increased $91 million, or 8 percent, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 10.6 percent from 11.0 percent principally due to changes in contract mix on Manned Aircraft programs and a gain of $45 million recognized in the prior year associated with the sale of a property, partially offset by the previously discussed $56 million favorable EAC adjustment largely related to performance incentives.INNOVATION SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Sales$3,276 — — — —Operating income343 — — — —Operating margin rate10.5% — — The sales and operating income above reflect the operating results of Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger date. In our comparative discussion below, we reference pro forma sales prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and computed as if the Merger had been completed as of January 1, 2017. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional supplemental consolidated pro forma financial information. This pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative of the results that would have actually occurred if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2017, nor are they indicative of future results.2018 – Innovation Systems sales for 2018 were $5.6 billion and for 2017 were $4.8 billion, each on a pro forma basis. The $0.8 billion, or 17 percent, increase reflects higher volume in each business area. Defense Systems sales reflect increased international volume on armament systems programs and increased volume on the Anti-Radiation Guided Missile program and small caliber ammunition programs. Flight Systems sales were primarily driven by higher Ground-based Midcourse Defense, A350 and F-35 volume. Space Systems sales increased primarily due to higher government satellite volume.-32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION MISSION SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Sales$11,709 $11,470 $11,161 2% 3 %Operating income1,520 1,442 1,468 5% (2)%Operating margin rate13.0% 12.6% 13.2% 2018 – Mission Systems sales for 2018 increased $239 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2017, primarily due to higher Sensors and Processing volume, partially offset by lower Cyber and ISR and Advanced Capabilities volume. Sensors and Processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on restricted programs, communications programs, F-35 and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) self-protection programs. Cyber and ISR sales decreased primarily due to ramp-down on a restricted ISR program. Advanced Capabilities sales reflect lower volume on the Joint National Integration Center Research and Development (JRDC) program and follow on activity, partially offset by higher volume on several programs, including the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System program.Operating income for 2018 increased $78 million, or 5 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate and higher sales. Operating margin rate increased to 13.0 percent from 12.6 percent primarily due to improved performance on Cyber and ISR and Sensors and Processing programs, partially offset by a $32 million benefit recognized in the prior year in connection with the 2017 Cost Claim described above.2017 – Mission Systems sales for 2017 increased $309 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2016 primarily due to higher Sensors and Processing volume, partially offset by lower Cyber and ISR volume. Sensors and Processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on F-35 sensors, EO/IR self-protection programs, communications programs and the SABR program. These increases were partially offset by lower volume on international ground-based radar programs. Cyber and ISR sales decreased primarily due to lower volume on restricted ISR programs.Operating income for 2017 decreased $26 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to a lower operating margin rate, partially offset by higher sales and $32 million recognized in connection with the 2017 Cost Claim described above. Operating margin rate decreased to 12.6 percent from 13.2 percent primarily due to lower margin rates on Sensors and Processing and Cyber and ISR programs principally resulting from lower performance and changes in contract mix. This decrease was partially offset by improved margin rates at Advanced Capabilities primarily due to the prior year including a $49 million forward loss provision on an Advanced Capabilities program.TECHNOLOGY SERVICES Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Sales$4,297 $4,687 $4,765 (8)% (2)%Operating income443 449 456 (1)% (2)%Operating margin rate10.3% 9.6% 9.6% 2018 – Technology Services sales for 2018 decreased $390 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2017, due to lower volume on Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by higher volume on Global Logistics and Modernization programs. Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services sales decreased primarily due to the completion of several programs, including JRDC, partially offset by higher volume on the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Training Support program (through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results). Global Logistics and Modernization sales increased primarily due to higher volume for several programs, including the Special Electronic Mission Aircraft program, partially offset by lower volume from the completion of the KC-10 program.Operating income for 2018 decreased $6 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by a higher operating margin rate. Operating margin rate increased to 10.3 percent from 9.6 percent primarily due to the close-out of a state IT outsourcing program.2017 – Technology Services sales for 2017 decreased $78 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower volume on System Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by higher volume on Global Logistics and Modernization programs. System Modernization and Services sales decreased principally due to the completion of several programs in 2016 and 2017. Global Logistics and Modernization sales increased primarily due -33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION to higher intercompany volume and increased sales on the UKAWACS and Hunter programs, partially offset by lower volume on the KC-10 program as our contract nears completion.Operating income for 2017 decreased $7 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to lower sales as described above. Operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year.PRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSISThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2018 2017 2016Segment Information: Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and ExpensesAerospace Systems Product $ 11,087 $ 9,889 $ 10,064 $ 8,988 $ 8,947 $ 7,945Service 2,009 1,796 2,067 1,854 1,906 1,710Innovation Systems Product 2,894 2,582 — — — —Service 382 351 — — — —Mission Systems Product 7,329 6,335 7,012 6,088 6,726 5,810Service 4,380 3,854 4,458 3,940 4,435 3,883Technology Services Product 485 450 391 360 327 299Service 3,812 3,404 4,296 3,878 4,438 4,010Segment Totals Total Product $21,795 $ 19,256 $17,467 $15,436 $16,000 $14,054Total Service 10,583 9,405 10,821 9,672 10,779 9,603Intersegment eliminations (2,283) (2,013) (2,284) (2,007) (2,073) (1,815)Total Segment(1) $30,095 $ 26,648 $26,004 $23,101 $24,706 $21,842(1) A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “Segment Operating Results.”Product Sales and Costs2018 – Product sales for 2018 increased $4.3 billion, or 25 percent, as compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to the addition of $2.9 billion of product sales from Innovation Systems and higher restricted and F-35 volume at Aerospace Systems. Product costs for 2018 increased $3.8 billion, or 25 percent, as compared with 2017, consistent with the higher product sales described above.2017 – Product sales for 2017 increased $1.5 billion, or 9 percent, as compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Higher Aerospace Systems product sales were primarily driven by increased restricted volume, partially offset by lower volume on the JWST and NATO AGS programs. The increase at Mission Systems was principally due to higher product volume on F-35 sensors, EO/IR self-protection programs and the SABR program.Product costs for 2017 increased $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, as compared with 2016, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflects lower product margin rates at Aerospace Systems, principally due to changes in contract mix, and Mission Systems.Service Sales and Costs2018 – Service sales for 2018 decreased $238 million, or 2 percent, as compared with 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower service sales at Technology Services principally due to the completion of several programs, partially offset by the addition of $382 million of service sales from Innovation Systems. -34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Service costs for 2018 decreased $267 million, or 3 percent, as compared with 2017, consistent with the lower service sales described above and reflects a higher service margin rate at Technology Services due to the close-out of a state IT outsourcing program.2017 – Service sales for 2017 were comparable with 2016. Higher service sales at Aerospace Systems on several Autonomous Systems and Manned Aircraft programs were offset by lower service volume principally on the KC-10 program at Technology Services.Service costs for 2017 increased $69 million, or 1 percent, as compared with 2016. The increase principally reflects a lower service margin rate at Mission Systems.BACKLOGBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method and applied the transition practical expedient related to backlog for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application. However, for comparative purposes, we have recast our backlog as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the impact of adoption of ASC Topic 606.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 $ in millions Funded Unfunded TotalBacklog TotalBacklog % Change in 2018Aerospace Systems $11,448 $14,992 $26,440 $25,560 3 %Innovation Systems 5,928 2,279 8,207 — —Mission Systems 9,676 5,732 15,408 13,277 16 %Technology Services 2,883 562 3,445 3,792 (9)%Total backlog $29,935 $23,565 $53,500 $42,629 26 %Approximately $26.6 billion of the $53.5 billion total backlog at December 31, 2018 is expected to be converted into sales in 2019.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities. In addition to our cash position, we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion; approximately $250 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditure commitments were $784 million at December 31, 2018, and are expected to be paid with cash on hand.-35-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2018 2017 2016Net earnings $3,229 $2,869 $2,043Non-cash items(1) 1,775 1,018 1,439Changes in assets and liabilities: Trade working capital (65) (285) (169)Retiree benefits, excluding MTM (expense) benefit (1,083) (946) (375)Other, net (29) (43) (125)Net cash provided by operating activities $3,827 $2,613 $2,813(1) Includes depreciation and amortization, MTM (expense) benefit, stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes.2018 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 increased by $1.2 billion, or 46 percent, as compared with 2017, principally due to higher net earnings, which include the addition of Innovation Systems, and improved trade working capital performance.2017 – Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 decreased by $200 million, or 7 percent, as compared with 2016, principally due to a $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution ($325 million after-tax) made in December 2017.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and share repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities $3,827 $2,613 $2,813 46% (7)%Less: capital expenditures (1,249) (928) (920) 35% 1 %Free cash flow $2,578 $1,685 $1,893 53% (11)%2018 – Free cash flow for 2018 increased $893 million, or 53 percent, as compared with 2017. The increase was principally driven by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by the inclusion of Innovation Systems’ capital expenditures and higher capital expenditures at Aerospace Systems.2017 – Free cash flow for 2017 decreased $208 million, or 11 percent, as compared with 2016. The decrease was principally driven by the $500 million voluntary pre-tax pension contribution discussed above.Investing Cash Flow2018 – Net cash used in investing activities for 2018 increased to $8.9 billion from $889 million in 2017. The increase was principally due to $7.7 billion paid for the acquisition of Orbital ATK, net of cash acquired. 2017 – Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 increased $84 million, or 10 percent, as compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds from the 2016 sales of a property at Aerospace Systems and a commercial cyber security business at Mission Systems, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of two investments in 2017.Financing Cash Flow2018 – Net cash used in financing activities during 2018 was $4.6 billion, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $7.0 billion in 2017. The change is principally due to $2.3 billion in debt repayments, $870 -36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION million higher share repurchases and $320 million in payments to credit facilities in 2018, compared with $8.2 billion net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2017.2017 – Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $7.0 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.8 billion in 2016. The change is principally due to $7.5 billion higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $1.2 billion lower share repurchases in 2017.Share Repurchases – See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs.Commercial Paper, Credit Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes – See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper, credit facilities and unsecured senior notes. Financial Arrangements – See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees.Other Sources of Capital – We believe we can obtain additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which allows us to access capital in a timely manner.Contractual ObligationsAt December 31, 2018, we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities. Payments due under these obligations and commitments, and the estimated timing of those payments, are as follows:$ in millions Total 2019 2020- 2021 2022- 2023 2024 and beyondLong-term debt $14,475 $517 $1,868 $2,558 $9,532Interest payments on long-term debt 7,181 550 1,008 903 4,720Operating leases 2,080 312 491 338 939Purchase obligations(1) 12,962 7,167 3,862 917 1,016Other long-term liabilities(2) 1,418 499 376 146 397Total contractual obligations $38,116 $9,045 $7,605 $4,862 $16,604 (1) A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.(2) Other long-term liabilities, including their current portions, primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves, deferred compensation and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which $159 million is related to environmental reserves recorded in Other current liabilities. It excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $772 million, as the timing of such payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and OPB plans, as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended. For further information about future minimum contributions for these plans, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 10 and 12, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are based on GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.-37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. Changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets for our pension and OPB plans and pension and OPB expense requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e. actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 4.31 percent at December 31, 2018, and 3.68 percent at December 31, 2017.-38-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2018 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2018 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2018 MTM expense (benefit), and 2019 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2019 pension and OPB (benefit) expense$(22) $202018 pension and OPB obligation and MTM expense (benefit)1,069 (1,016)Cash Balance Crediting Rate – A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM (benefit) expense. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 3.0 percent as of December 31, 2018, growing to 3.25 percent by 2024. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2018 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2018 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2018 MTM (benefit) expense, and 2019 expected pension expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2019 pension (benefit) expense$(11) $122018 pension obligation and MTM (benefit) expense(125) 130Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.During 2018, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations. The current asset allocation is approximately 45% equities, 30% fixed-income and 25% alternatives, which reflects a shift of approximately 5% from fixed-income to alternatives. At this time, the Investment Committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2018 was approximately 10.9 percent and our 20-year rolling average rate of return was approximately 7.1 percent, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2018 actual net plan asset losses were approximately 3.5 percent.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.-39-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION For determining 2018 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.65 percent. For 2019 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and 7.67 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2018 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2019 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease 25 Basis Point Increase2019 pension and OPB expense (benefit)$69 $(69)In addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2019 MTM expense (benefit):$ in millions100 Basis Point Decrease 100 Basis Point Increase 2019 MTM expense (benefit)275 (275)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values, as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. The SOA has issued annual updates to their mortality improvement scale each year since then as additional data has become available. These updates generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the original projections from 2014. After considering the additional information released by the SOA in October 2018, and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience, we continued our practice of adopting the latest SOA projection scale, but with a long-term improvement rate of 0.75% versus 1.0% assumed by the SOA. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2018, and the amounts estimated for our 2019 pension and OPB expense.For further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters – We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.-40-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible AssetsOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.We test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.OTHER MATTERSOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2018, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, which largely will be recorded on our balance sheet effective January 1, 2019 in connection with our adoption of the new lease standard. For additional information on our operating leases, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.-41-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $335 million at December 31, 2018. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate, short-term borrowings under our credit facilities, for which there was £85 million (the equivalent of approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2018) outstanding at December 31, 2018 and on our outstanding short-term commercial paper borrowings, for which there was $198 million outstanding at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we have $14.4 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $14.3 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2018, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $114 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2018, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.COMMODITY PRICE RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to commodity price risk on purchases of inventory such as copper and zinc. We enter into forward contracts and purchase orders for the current expected production requirements for small-caliber ammunition supply contracts. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2018, we had commodity forward contracts outstanding that hedge forecasted commodity purchases of 10 million pounds of copper and 4 million pounds of zinc. At December 31, 2018, a 10 percent unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. -42-",2023-12-30 20:39:10.248431
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017.Acquisition of Orbital ATKOn June 6, 2018 (the “Merger Date”), the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Orbital ATK, Inc. (“Orbital ATK”) (the “Merger”). On the Merger date, Orbital ATK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, Inc. We established Innovation Systems as a new, fourth business sector. The operating results of Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger Date have been included in the company’s consolidated financial results. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Orbital ATK.In June 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Decision and Order enabling the acquisition to proceed and providing for solid rocket motors to be available on a non-discriminatory basis under certain circumstances and processes. The company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the Order. Similarly, the Compliance Officer, appointed under the Order, and the FTC have taken and continue to take various actions to oversee compliance. In October 2019, the company received a civil investigative demand from the FTC requesting certain information relating to a potential issue of the company’s compliance with the Order in connection with a pending strategic missile competition. The company has provided information in response to the request. We believe the company has been and continues to be in full compliance with the Order, but we cannot predict any potential impact on the procurement.Global Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities.The global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty. Geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2020, reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility. The global economy may also be affected by Britain’s anticipated exit from the European Union, the full impact of which is not known at this time. Additionally, economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a ten-year period (FY 2012 through FY 2021), including specific limits for defense and non-defense spending. In prior years, these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years. In 2019, the President proposed an FY 2020 budget requesting $750 billion for national security. The President’s budget request addresses various capabilities highlighted in the U.S. National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy and the Missile Defense Review. On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was enacted, increasing spending caps under the Budget Control Act (BCA) for FY 2020 and FY 2021, the final two fiscal years covered by the BCA, and suspending the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. On December 20, 2019, FY 2020 appropriations for all federal agencies were enacted, representing a 3 percent increase from FY 2019. We believe our capabilities, particularly in space, missiles, missile defense, hypersonics, counter-hypersonics, low observable technology and cyber will allow us to continue to profitably grow our business in support of our customers’ needs. The political environment, federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. -25-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules that govern our U.S. government business and related Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude Mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) (expense) benefit and related tax impacts, and are described as MTM-adjusted net earnings and MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts2019 2018 2017 20192018Sales$33,841 $30,095 $26,004 12 % 16 %Operating costs and expenses29,872 26,315 22,786 14 % 15 %Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales88.3% 87.4% 87.6% Operating income3,969 3,780 3,218 5 % 17 %Operating margin rate11.7% 12.6% 12.4% Mark-to-market pension and OPB (expense) benefit(1,800) (655) 536 175 % NMFederal and foreign income tax expense300 513 1,360 (42)% (62)%Effective income tax rate11.8% 13.7% 32.2% Net earnings2,248 3,229 2,869 (30)% 13 %Diluted earnings per share13.22 18.49 16.34 (29)% 13 %-26-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Sales2019 sales increased $3.7 billion reflecting a full year of sales from Innovation Systems as well as higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Technology Services. See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. Operating Income and Margin Rate2019 operating income increased $189 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to a $462 million increase in segment operating income, which includes a full year of operating income from Innovation Systems. This was partially offset by a $148 million decrease in the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment and a $125 million increase in unallocated corporate expense, all of which are further discussed in “Segment Operating Results.” Operating margin rate declined to 11.7 percent from 12.6 percent due to the pension and unallocated corporate expense items noted above, partially offset by a higher segment operating margin rate, as described in “Segment Operating Results.” 2019 G&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.7 percent from 10.0 percent, primarily due to higher sales as well as cost management, including cost synergies realized in connection with the 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK. For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.Mark-to-Market Pension and OPB (Expense) Benefit The primary components of pre-tax MTM (expense) benefit are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2019 2018 2017Actuarial (losses) gains on projected benefit obligation$(4,866) $2,772 $(1,570)Actuarial gains (losses) on plan assets 3,066 (3,426) 2,119Other— (1) (13)MTM (expense) benefit$(1,800) $(655) $5362019 MTM expense of $1.8 billion was primarily driven by a 92 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2018 as well as a change in our mortality assumptions, partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 19.1 percent compared to our 8.0 percent asset return assumption.Federal and Foreign Income TaxesThe 2019 effective tax rate decreased to 11.8 percent from 13.7 percent in 2018. MTM expense reduced the 2019 effective tax rate by 3.7 percentage points and the 2018 effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points.

Excluding these impacts, MTM-adjusted net earnings decreased by $118 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to a $397 million decrease in the total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and $170 million of higher intangible asset -27-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation. These decreases were partially offset by $462 million of higher segment operating income.

Excluding these impacts, MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased $0.12, or 1 percent, reflecting a 3 percent decrease in MTM-adjusted net earnings and a 3 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Innovation Systems, Mission Systems and Technology Services. The segment operating results below include sales and operating income for Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger date. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aerospace Systems Innovation Systems Mission Systems Technology ServicesAutonomous Systems Defense Systems Advanced Capabilities Global Logistics and ModernizationManned Aircraft Flight Systems Cyber and ISR Global ServicesSpace Space Systems Sensors and Processing Effective January 1, 2019, the former Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services business areas of Technology Services were merged to create the Global Services business area. This change had no impact on the prior segment operating results of Technology Services as a whole. In September 2019, the company announced changes effective January 1, 2020, which are intended to better align the company’s broad portfolio to serve its customers’ needs. The four new sectors are: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. This realignment is not reflected in any of the accompanying financial information.This section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. -28-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) measures that reflect total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense we have recognized under FAR and CAS, and excluding FAS pension expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS or FAR, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Segment operating margin rate of 11.6 percent was comparable to the prior year.Net FAS (service)/CAS Pension AdjustmentThe decrease in our 2019 net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment is primarily due to lower CAS expense largely as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2018, partially offset by increased CAS expense due to the addition of Innovation Systems.Unallocated Corporate ExpenseThe increase in 2019 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to the absence in 2019 of a $223 million benefit recognized for the finalization of certain prior year cost claims, as well as $170 million of higher intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation. This increase was partially offset by $140 million of lower deferred state taxes and an $89 million benefit recognized in 2019 related to the favorable resolution of a cost accounting litigation matter.Net Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2019 2018 2017Favorable EAC adjustments$1,040 $1,019 $717Unfavorable EAC adjustments(560) (442) (357)Net EAC adjustments$480 $ 577 $ 360-29-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Net EAC adjustments by segment are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions2019 2018 2017Aerospace Systems$135 $309 $250Innovation Systems(1)133 34 —Mission Systems150 175 104Technology Services77 76 19Eliminations(15) (17) (13)Net EAC adjustments$480 $577 $360(1) Amounts reflect EAC adjustments after the percent complete on Innovation Systems contracts was reset to zero as of the Merger date.For purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this Segment Operating Results section, references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate, respectively.AEROSPACE SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions2019 2018 2017 2019 2018Sales$13,862 $13,096 $12,131 6% 8%Operating income1,434 1,411 1,289 2% 9%Operating margin rate10.3% 10.8% 10.6% Sales2019 sales increased $766 million, or 6 percent, due in large part to higher volume on restricted programs. In addition, manned aircraft sales reflect a higher rate of F-35 production activity and higher volume on the E-2 program. Space sales reflect higher volume on Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Autonomous systems sales include higher Global Hawk volume and lower NATO AGS volume as that program nears completion. Operating Income2019 operating income increased $23 million, or 2 percent, due to higher sales. 2019 operating margin rate decreased to 10.3 percent from 10.8 percent principally due to lower net favorable EAC adjustments.

Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional supplemental consolidated pro forma financial information. This pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative of the results that would have actually occurred if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2017, nor are they indicative of future results.Sales2019 sales increased $541 million, or 10 percent, compared with 2018 pro forma sales of $5.6 billion due to higher sales in all three business areas. Flight Systems sales reflect higher volume on military aerospace structures and launch vehicles. Space Systems sales reflect higher volume on national security satellite systems. Defense Systems sales increased due to higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems, including the AARGM-ER and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System programs. -30-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Operating Income2019 operating income totaled $671 million and operating margin rate was 11.0 percent.

Global Logistics and Modernization sales declined primarily due to the 2018 completion of the KC-10 program, partially offset by higher volume on electronic systems sustainment programs. Operating Income2019 operating income increased $14 million, or 3 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 11.1 percent from 10.3 percent primarily due to improved performance in both business areas, including a favorable adjustment on a Global Logistics and Modernization sustainment program. -31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION PRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSISThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2019 2018 2017Segment Information: Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and Expenses Sales Operating Costs and ExpensesAerospace Systems Product $ 11,778 $ 10,609 $ 11,087 $ 9,889 $ 10,064 $ 8,988Service 2,084 1,819 2,009 1,796 2,067 1,854Innovation Systems Product 5,467 4,873 2,894 2,582 — —Service 652 575 382 351 — —Mission Systems Product 7,711 6,632 7,329 6,335 7,012 6,088Service 4,552 3,992 4,380 3,854 4,458 3,940Technology Services Product 554 507 485 450 391 360Service 3,556 3,146 3,812 3,404 4,296 3,878Segment Totals Total Product $25,510 $22,621 $21,795 $19,256 $17,467 $15,436Total Service 10,844 9,532 10,583 9,405 10,821 9,672Intersegment eliminations (2,513) (2,221) (2,283) (2,013) (2,284) (2,007)Total Segment(1) $33,841 $29,932 $30,095 $26,648 $26,004 $23,101(1) A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “Segment Operating Results.”Product Sales and Costs2019 product sales increased $3.7 billion, or 17 percent, primarily due to a full year of product sales from Innovation Systems and higher volume on restricted, F-35 and Next Gen OPIR programs at Aerospace Systems.2019 product costs increased $3.4 billion, or 17 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above.Service Sales and Costs2019 service sales increased $261 million, or 2 percent. The increase was primarily driven by a full year of service sales from Innovation Systems and higher service sales at Mission Systems, partially offset by lower service sales at Technology Services principally due to program completions.2019 service costs increased $127 million, or 1 percent, consistent with the higher service sales described above and reflects improved margin rates on service contracts at each sector. BACKLOGBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.-32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 $ in millions Funded Unfunded TotalBacklog TotalBacklog % Change in 2019Aerospace Systems $11,587 $21,875 $33,462 $26,440 27%Innovation Systems 5,575 3,905 9,480 8,207 16%Mission Systems 10,317 7,806 18,123 15,408 18%Technology Services 2,798 977 3,775 3,445 10%Total backlog $30,277 $34,563 $64,840 $53,500 21%LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities. In addition to our cash position, we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion; approximately $269 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditure commitments were $790 million at December 31, 2019, and are expected to be paid with cash on hand.Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions 2019 2018 2017Net earnings $2,248 $3,229 $2,869Non-cash items(1) 2,683 1,775 1,018Changes in assets and liabilities: Trade working capital 128 (65) (285)Retiree benefits, excluding MTM (expense) benefit (703) (1,083) (946)Other, net (59) (29) (43)Net cash provided by operating activities $4,297 $3,827 $2,613(1) Includes depreciation and amortization, MTM (expense) benefit, non-cash lease expense, stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes.2019 cash provided by operating activities increased $470 million principally due to improved trade working capital and lower pension contributions.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and share repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.-33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: Year Ended December 31 % Change in$ in millions 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018Net cash provided by operating activities $4,297 $3,827 $2,613 12% 46%Less: capital expenditures (1,264) (1,249) (928) 1% 35%Free cash flow $3,033 $2,578 $1,685 18% 53%2019 free cash flow increased $455 million principally driven by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities. Investing Cash Flow2019 net cash used in investing activities decreased to $1.2 billion from $8.9 billion principally due to $7.7 billion paid in 2018 for the acquisition of Orbital ATK, net of cash acquired. Financing Cash Flow2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased to $2.4 billion from $4.6 billion principally due to lower debt and credit facility repayments of $2.1 billion and lower share repurchases, partially offset by net repayments of commercial paper in 2019 as compared to net borrowings in 2018. Share Repurchases – See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs.Commercial Paper, Credit Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes – See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper, credit facilities and unsecured senior notes. Financial Arrangements – See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees.Other Sources of Capital – We believe we can obtain additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which allows us to access capital in a timely manner.Contractual ObligationsAt December 31, 2019, we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities.

These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.(2) Other long-term liabilities, including their current portions, primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves, deferred compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities. It excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $1.2 billion as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to such positions.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and OPB plans, as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended. For further information about future minimum contributions for these plans, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Further details -34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 10 and 15, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are based on GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates, as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and -35-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION the effects of changing assumptions (i.e. actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 3.39 percent at December 31, 2019, and 4.31 percent at December 31, 2018.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2019 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2019 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2019 MTM expense (benefit), and 2020 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2020 pension and OPB (benefit) expense$(34) $312019 pension and OPB obligation and MTM expense (benefit)1,297 (1,230)Cash Balance Crediting Rate – A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 2.39 percent as of December 31, 2019, growing to 2.64 percent by 2025. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2019 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2019 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2019 MTM expense (benefit), and 2020 expected pension expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate 25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2020 pension (benefit) expense$(11) $122019 pension obligation and MTM expense (benefit)(136) 151Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.During 2019, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations. The current asset allocation is approximately 40% public equities, 30% fixed-income and 30% alternatives, which reflects a shift of approximately 5% from public equities to alternatives. At this time, the Investment Committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.-36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2019 was approximately 11.1 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 7.1 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2019 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 19.1 percent.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.For determining 2019 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.67 percent. For 2020 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and 7.66 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2019 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2020 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease 25 Basis Point Increase2020 pension and OPB expense (benefit)$78 $(78)In addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2020 MTM expense (benefit):$ in millions100 Basis Point Decrease 100 Basis Point Increase 2020 MTM expense (benefit)$312 $(312)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values, as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the SOA issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)) as well as an updated mortality improvement scale (MP-2019). The updated model is based on a comprehensive study, which shifted the blue/white collar mix in prior tables more toward blue collar in the Pri-2012 table. Considering our employee population, we performed a study of our recent actual pension plan mortality experience to determine whether the Pri-2012 table’s shift toward blue collar was appropriate for our company. After considering the additional information released by the SOA in October 2019, and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience, we adopted the Pri-2012 White Collar table along with their projection scale, but with a long-term improvement rate of 0.75% versus 1.0% assumed by the SOA. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2019, and the amounts estimated for our 2020 pension and OPB expense.For further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of -37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters – We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. Income Tax Matters – The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information. The technical merits of its position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations. During 2019, we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $319 million related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs, and the 2017 Tax Act.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible AssetsOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions.-38-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.We test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.OTHER MATTERSOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2019, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.-39-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $382 million at December 31, 2019. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate, short-term borrowings under our credit facilities, for which there was £60 million (the equivalent of approximately $78 million as of December 31, 2019) outstanding at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we have $13.9 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $15.1 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2019, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $98 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2019, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.-40-",2023-12-30 20:39:00.600950
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K”), as well as Exhibit 99.3 of our Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on April 29, 2020, which recasts the disclosures in certain portions of the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect changes in the company’s reportable segments, both of which provide additional information on comparisons of years 2019 and 2018. Acquisition of Orbital ATKOn June 6, 2018 (the “Merger Date”), the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Orbital ATK, Inc. (“Orbital ATK”) (the “Merger”). On the Merger date, Orbital ATK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, Inc. We established Innovation Systems as a new, fourth business sector. The operating results of legacy Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger Date have been included in the company’s consolidated results of operations and, upon our January 1, 2020 sector realignment, are reflected in the Space Systems, Defense Systems and Aeronautics Systems sectors. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Orbital ATK.In June 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Decision and Order enabling the acquisition to proceed and providing for solid rocket motors to be available on a non-discriminatory basis under certain circumstances and processes. The company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the Order. Similarly, the Compliance Officer, appointed under the Order, and the FTC have taken and continue to take various actions to oversee compliance. In October 2019, the company received a civil investigative demand from the FTC requesting certain information relating to a potential issue of the company’s compliance with the Order in connection with a then pending strategic missile competition. The company has provided information in response to the request. We believe the company has been and continues to be in full compliance with the Order, but we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter.Disposition of IT and Mission Support Services BusinessOn December 7, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our IT and mission support services business for $3.4 billion in cash. The IT and mission support services business is comprised of the majority of the Information Solutions and Services (IS&S) division of Defense Systems (excluding our Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which are part of the Cyber and Intelligence Mission Solutions (CIMS) division of Mission Systems; and the Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. The assets and liabilities of the IT and mission support services business were classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and no impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to complete the sale of the IT and mission support services business in the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the disposition.COVID-19Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) was first reported in late 2019 and has since dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns or shutdowns, government challenges and market volatility. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the President declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak. The company’s leadership, our crisis management and business resumption teams, and local site leadership continue closely to monitor and address the developments, including the impact on our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities. The company has considered and continues to consider guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), other health organizations, federal, state and local governmental authorities, and our customers, among others. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers. Our goals have been to lessen the immediate potential adverse impacts, both health and economic, and to continue to position the company for long-term success. Like the communities in which we serve, our actions have varied depending on the spread of COVID-19 and local health requirements, the needs of our employees and the needs of our business. Among other actions, we have required or enabled employees to work from home or remotely where practicable, and expanded IT and communication support to enhance their productivity; adjusted work spaces and shift schedules to facilitate social distancing for those who continue to work in our facilities; enhanced cleaning and disinfecting procedures at our facilities; required face coverings and worked -27-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION to procure and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE); implemented health checks and visitor protocols; restricted travel; provided additional benefits to our employees, including for those most at risk; and contributed financial and manufacturing resources to supporting critical national requirements, such as for PPE. Along with the Northrop Grumman Foundation, we have provided grants for global, national and local organizations that support frontline healthcare workers, address food insecurity, advance efforts for vaccines, increase student access to technology and provide support to vulnerable populations; donated PPE items to emergency response teams and healthcare professionals, including N95 masks and Tyvek suits; and established a COVID-19 relief matching gift program for employees. More recently, we have sought to assist state and local governments as they start to distribute and deliver vaccines.Earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic and at times of higher transmission, many state and local jurisdictions implemented mandatory stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders. Most of those orders exempted some or all of the defense industrial base, including Northrop Grumman and many of our suppliers, as part of the essential or critical infrastructure. Our facilities have largely remained open and many of our employees who cannot work remotely are continuing to come to work and support our customers’ national security and mission-essential operations. Towards the end of the second quarter of 2020, some state and local jurisdictions started to lift mandatory stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and started gradually to ease restrictions. We started to implement, or prepared to implement certain return to office plans to allow some employees who had been working remotely gradually to return to the workplace. Later in 2020, as the number of cases began to rise again, and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2020, we paused or reversed many of our efforts to bring more employees back to the work place. In the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, after FDA approval, we began to explore how the company could best facilitate the provision of vaccinations to our personnel in accordance with federal guidance and state and local vaccination plans. Absenteeism rates (including because of employees in quarantine or those suffering from COVID-19) and the impacts on productivity have fluctuated significantly, especially as local cases and transmission rates have changed. Throughout, we have worked to adapt and to take robust actions to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees and to serve our customers, considering, among other things, local circumstances, state and local requirements and guidance from the CDC. We have also taken various steps in efforts to support our suppliers, with a particular focus on critical small and midsized business partners, including passing through increased progress payments from DoD to our suppliers and accelerating payments to certain suppliers. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience various increased costs to maintain our operations, including as a result of actions taken to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees; because of illness, quarantines, and absenteeism; as a result of government actions; and because of disruption and stress among our suppliers and customers. We have also experienced certain lower costs, including those related to employee travel, some health benefits and personal time off. We continue to monitor this situation closely and cannot predict how it will change, including the extent of any increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and the costs and impacts to us. Our customers have generally continued to make timely payments, and we are working with them to consider the possibility of additional cost recoveries. Again, however, our customers are facing tremendous demands and budget pressures, and we cannot predict how this may change and how they will continue to allocate limited resources.The company’s overall 2020 revenue and operating income were not significantly impacted by COVID-19. However, our employees, suppliers and customers, the company and our global community are facing tremendous challenges and we cannot predict how this dynamic situation will evolve or the impact it will have on the company. For further information on the potential impact to the company of COVID-19, see “Risk Factors.”Global Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities.The global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty. Geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2021 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility and the COVID-19 pandemic. The global economy may also be affected by Britain’s exit from the European Union, the full impact of which is not known at this time. Additionally, economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. -28-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a ten-year period (FY 2012 through FY 2021), including specific limits for defense and non-defense spending. In prior years, these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years.In August 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was enacted, increasing spending caps under the Budget Control Act (BCA) for FY 2020 and FY 2021, the final two fiscal years covered by the BCA, and suspending the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. In February 2020, the then President proposed a budget request for FY 2021, which addressed various capabilities highlighted in the U.S. National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy and the Missile Defense Review. On December 27, 2020, FY 2021 appropriations were enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. In 2020, Congress also passed several emergency COVID-19 relief bills addressing certain impacts of the pandemic. It is continuing to consider other responses to the COVID-19 crisis, with broader implications for the defense industry and the overall economic environment, including the national debt. With a new President and Administration, a new Congress and pressing debt and needs, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. However, the threat remains very substantial and we believe that our capabilities, particularly in space, missiles, missile defense, hypersonics, counter-hypersonics, survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers to meet the threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable growth in our business. The political environment, federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules that govern our U.S. government business and related Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude Mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) expense and related tax impacts, and are described as MTM-adjusted net earnings and MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. We reconcile these non-GAAP -29-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts20202019201820202019Sales$36,799 $33,841 $30,095 9 %12 %Operating costs and expenses32,734 29,872 26,315 10 %14 %Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales89.0 %88.3 %87.4 %Operating income4,065 3,969 3,780 2 %5 %Operating margin rate11.0 %11.7 %12.6 %Mark-to-market pension and OPB expense(1,034)(1,800)(655)(43)%175 %Federal and foreign income tax expense539 300 513 80 %(42)%Effective income tax rate14.5 %11.8 %13.7 %Net earnings3,189 2,248 3,229 42 %(30)%Diluted earnings per share19.03 13.22 18.49 44 %(29)%Sales2020 sales increased $3.0 billion, or 9 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors.See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. Operating Income and Margin Rate2020 operating income increased $96 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to an increase in segment operating income, partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expense and a lower net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment. 2020 operating margin rate declined to 11.0 percent from 11.7 percent principally due to a lower segment operating margin rate, higher unallocated corporate expense and lower net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment.2020 G&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.3 percent from 9.7 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher independent research and development costs.For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.Mark-to-Market Pension and OPB ExpenseThe primary components of pre-tax MTM expense are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202020192018Actuarial (losses) gains on projected benefit obligation$(3,570)$(4,866)$2,772 Actuarial gains (losses) on plan assets 2,536 3,066 (3,426)Other— — (1)MTM expense$(1,034)$(1,800)$(655)2020 MTM expense of $1.0 billion was primarily driven by a 71 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2019, partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 16.2 percent compared to our 8.0 percent asset return assumption.Federal and Foreign Income TaxesThe 2020 effective tax rate increased to 14.5 percent from 11.8 percent in 2019. MTM expense reduced the 2020 effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points and the 2019 effective tax rate by 3.7 percentage points. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.-30-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Net EarningsThe table below reconciles net earnings to MTM-adjusted net earnings: Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Net earnings$3,189 $2,248 $3,229 42 %(30)%MTM expense1,034 1,800 655 (43)%175 %MTM-related deferred state tax benefit(1)(54)(81)(29)(33)%179 %Federal tax benefit of items above(2)(206)(361)(131)(43)%176 %MTM expense, net of tax774 1,358 495 (43)%174 %MTM-adjusted net earnings$3,963 $3,606 $3,724 10 %(3)%(1)MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future state tax returns. The deferred state tax benefit was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent in 2020 and 4.50 percent in 2019 and 2018 and included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income. (2)MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future federal tax returns. The federal tax benefit in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax benefit from MTM expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate. Net earnings increased $941 million, or 42 percent, in 2020 principally due to a $584 million decrease in our MTM expense, net of tax. Excluding this impact, MTM-adjusted net earnings increased by $357 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to increases in our FAS (non-service) benefit and operating income, partially offset by higher income tax and interest expense.Diluted Earnings Per ShareThe table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31% Change in20202019201820202019Diluted earnings per share$19.03 $13.22 $18.49 44 %(29)%MTM expense per share6.17 10.59 3.76 (42)%182 %MTM-related deferred state tax benefit per share(1)(0.32)(0.48)(0.17)(33)%182 %Federal tax benefit of items above per share(2)(1.23)(2.12)(0.75)(42)%183 %MTM expense per share, net of tax4.62 7.99 2.84 (42)%181 %MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share$23.65 $21.21 $21.33 12 %(1)%(1)MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future state tax returns. The deferred state tax benefit was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent in 2020 and 4.50 percent in 2019 and 2018 and included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income. (2)MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future federal tax returns. The federal tax benefit in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax benefit from MTM expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.Diluted earnings per share increased $5.81, or 44 percent, principally due to a $3.37 increase associated with lower MTM expense, net of tax. Excluding this impact, MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share increased $2.44, or 12 percent, reflecting a 10 percent increase in MTM-adjusted net earnings and a 1 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationEffective January 1, 2020, the company reorganized its sectors to better align the company’s broad portfolio to serve its customers’ needs. At December 31, 2020, the company was aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. The segment operating results below include sales and operating income for legacy Innovation Systems subsequent to the Merger date. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the company no longer considers certain unallowable costs as part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. As a result, certain unallowable costs, which were previously included in segment operating results, are now reported in Unallocated corporate expense within -31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION operating income. This change has been applied retrospectively in the accompanying financial information. See Part II, Item 5 in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 for further information regarding the impact of this change on the company’s prior period segment information.We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aeronautics SystemsDefense SystemsMission SystemsSpace SystemsAutonomous SystemsBattle Management & Missile SystemsAirborne Sensors & NetworksLaunch & Strategic MissilesManned AircraftMission ReadinessCyber & Intelligence Mission SolutionsSpaceMaritime/Land Systems & SensorsNavigation, Targeting & SurvivabilityThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rates. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) measures that reflect total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense we have recognized under FAR and CAS, and excluding FAS pension expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS or FAR, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Segment operating margin rate decreased to 11.4 percent from 11.8 percent principally due to a lower operating margin rate at Aeronautics Systems.Net FAS (service)/CAS Pension AdjustmentThe decrease in our 2020 net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment is primarily due to higher FAS (service) pension expense largely as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2019.-32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Unallocated Corporate ExpenseThe increase in 2020 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to the absence in 2020 of an $89 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of a cost accounting litigation matter and $60 million of higher state tax expense in the current year. State tax expense increased principally due to changes in deferred state income taxes, including a lower MTM-related deferred state tax benefit, and an increase in reserves, in part, for potential unallowable costs associated with state apportionment. These increases were partially offset by $68 million of lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation.Net Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below:Year Ended December 31$ in millions202020192018Favorable EAC adjustments$1,082 $1,040 $1,019 Unfavorable EAC adjustments(616)(560)(442)Net EAC adjustments$466 $ 480 $ 577 Net EAC adjustments by segment are presented in the table below:Year Ended December 31$ in millions202020192018Aeronautics Systems(1)$77 $143 $271 Defense Systems(1)148 99 75 Mission Systems216 189 172 Space Systems(1)33 63 73 Eliminations(8)(14)(14)Net EAC adjustments$466 $480 $577 (1)Amounts reflect EAC adjustments after the percent complete on legacy Innovation Systems contracts was reset to zero as of the Merger date.For purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this Segment Operating Results section, references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate, respectively.AERONAUTICS SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Sales$12,169 $11,116 $10,293 9 %8 %Operating income1,206 1,188 1,128 2 %5 %Operating margin rate9.9 %10.7 %11.0 %Sales2020 sales increased $1.1 billion, or 9 percent, due to higher sales in both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. Higher volume on restricted programs, including a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer, E-2D and Triton were partially offset by lower volume on the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization program as it nears completion. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the sale of equipment described above.Operating Income2020 operating income increased $18 million, or 2 percent, due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. 2020 operating margin rate decreased to 9.9 percent from 10.7 percent principally due to lower net EAC adjustments as well as the sale of equipment to a restricted customer, which was dilutive to the overall sector margin rate.-33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION DEFENSE SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Sales$7,543 $7,495 $6,612 1 %13 %Operating income846 793 697 7 %14 %Operating margin rate11.2 %10.6 %10.5 %Sales2020 sales increased $48 million, or 1 percent, due to higher volume in both business areas. Battle Management & Missile Systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the Guided Missile Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar program and other missile products, partially offset by lower volume on programs nearing completion, including an international weapons program and the close-out of our contract at the Army’s Lake City ammunition plant. Mission Readiness sales increased principally due to higher volume on restricted and international programs, partially offset by lower volume on the Hunter sustainment program as it nears completion.Operating Income2020 operating income increased $53 million, or 7 percent, primarily due to a higher operating margin rate. Operating margin increased to 11.2 percent from 10.6 percent principally due to improved performance at Battle Management & Missile Systems and Mission Readiness.MISSION SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Sales$10,080 $9,410 $8,949 7 %5 %Operating income1,459 1,408 1,245 4 %13 %Operating margin rate14.5 %15.0 %13.9 %Sales2020 sales increased $670 million, or 7 percent, due to higher volume across all four business areas. Airborne Sensors & Networks sales increased principally due to higher airborne radar volume, including the F-35, Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) and Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) programs, and higher restricted volume. Navigation, Targeting & Survivability sales increased primarily due to higher volume on self-protection, avionics and targeting programs, including LITENING, partially offset by lower volume on infrared countermeasures programs. Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors sales increased primarily due to higher volume on marine systems and restricted programs, partially offset by lower international commercial volume due, in part, to COVID-19-related impacts. Cyber & Intelligence Mission Solutions sales increased principally due to higher restricted volume, partially offset by lower volume on an intelligence program as it nears completion.Operating Income2020 operating income increased $51 million, or 4 percent, due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 14.5 percent from 15.0 percent primarily due to lower margin rates at Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors, including COVID-19-related impacts on certain international commercial businesses.SPACE SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Sales$8,744 $7,425 $5,845 18 %27 %Operating income893 794 644 12 %23 %Operating margin rate10.2 %10.7 %11.0 %Sales2020 sales increased $1.3 billion, or 18 percent, due to higher sales in both Space and Launch & Strategic Missiles.

It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019: 20202019$ in millionsFundedUnfundedTotalBacklogTotalBacklog% Change in 2020Aeronautics Systems$10,587 $13,415 $24,002 $26,021 (8)%Defense Systems6,942 1,189 8,131 8,481 (4)%Mission Systems9,444 4,361 13,805 14,226 (3)%Space Systems5,569 29,462 35,031 16,112 117 %Total backlog$32,542 $48,427 $80,969 $64,840 25 %2020 net awards totaled $52.9 billion.

In addition to our cash position, we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion; approximately $276 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. In March 2020, we issued $2.25 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment and working capital, to help preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, we entered into a one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility to provide an additional source of potential financing. On October 15, 2020, the company repaid $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes upon maturity.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) established a program with provisions to allow U.S. companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022. Under Section 3610, the CARES Act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of COVID-19. The company has begun to seek, and anticipates continuing to seek, recovery for certain COVID-19-related costs under Section 3610 of the CARES Act and through our contract provisions. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts. While it is unclear how much we will be able to recover, in particular under Section 3610, we believe these actions should continue to mitigate some potential COVID-19-related negative impacts to our operating cash flows in 2021.Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditure commitments were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and are expected to be paid with cash on hand.-36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202020192018Net earnings$3,189 $2,248 $3,229 Non-cash items(1)2,601 2,683 1,775 Changes in assets and liabilities:Trade working capital227 128 (65)Retiree benefits, excluding MTM expense(1,678)(703)(1,083)Other, net(34)(59)(29)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,305 $4,297 $3,827 (1)Includes depreciation and amortization, MTM expense, stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes.2020 cash provided by operating activities was comparable to the prior period and reflects higher net earnings and improved trade working capital as well as a $750 million discretionary pre-tax pension contribution ($593 million after-tax) as compared to a $120 million discretionary pre-tax pension contribution ($95 million after-tax) in the prior year period.Adjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and share repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20202019201820202019Net cash provided by operating activities$4,305 $4,297 $3,827 — %12 %Capital expenditures(1,420)(1,264)(1,249)12 %1 %Proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer205 — — NMNMAfter-tax discretionary pension contributions593 95 186 524 %(49)%Adjusted free cash flow$3,683 $3,128 $2,764 18 %13 %2020 adjusted free cash flow increased $555 million, principally driven by higher net earnings and improved trade working capital as well as $205 million in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.Investing Cash Flow2020 net cash used in investing activities was comparable to the prior period and reflects higher capital expenditures, as well as $205 million in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer.Financing Cash Flow2020 net cash used in financing activities decreased to $432 million from $2.4 billion principally due to $2.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2020.Share Repurchases – See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs.-37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Commercial Paper, Credit Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes – See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper, credit facilities and unsecured senior notes. Financial Arrangements – See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees.Other Sources of Capital – We believe we can obtain additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which allows us to access capital in a timely manner.Contractual ObligationsAt December 31, 2020, we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities. Payments due under these obligations and commitments, and the estimated timing of those payments, are as follows:$ in millionsTotal20212022- 20232024- 20252026 and beyondLong-term debt$15,091 $742 $2,558 $1,506 $10,285 Interest payments on long-term debt8,473 596 1,126 996 5,755 Operating leases2,022 298 495 327 902 Purchase obligations(1)17,761 8,279 4,065 2,941 2,476 Other long-term liabilities(2)1,619 370 579 157 513 Total contractual obligations$44,966 $10,285 $8,823 $5,927 $19,931 (1)A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.(2)Other long-term liabilities, including their current portions, primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves, deferred compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities. It excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to such positions.The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and OPB plans, as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended. For further information about future minimum contributions for these plans, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Further details regarding long-term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 10 and 15, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are based on GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. -38-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates, as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e. actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 2.68 percent at December 31, 2020, and 3.39 percent at December 31, 2019.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2020 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2020 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2020 MTM expense (benefit), and 2021 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2021 pension and OPB (benefit) expense$(45)$42 2020 pension and OPB obligation and MTM expense (benefit)1,471 (1,385)-39-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Cash Balance Crediting Rate – A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate used for FAS purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to the minimum threshold of 2.25 percent as of December 31, 2020, and will remain at 2.25 percent through 2026. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2020 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2020 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2020 MTM expense (benefit), and 2021 expected pension expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2021 pension (benefit) expense$— $11 2020 pension obligation and MTM expense (benefit)— 169 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.During 2020, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations. The current asset allocation is approximately 40% public equities, 35% fixed-income, 20% alternatives and 5% cash. At this time, the Investment Committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2020 was approximately 11.2 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 8.0 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2020 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 16.2 percent.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.For determining 2020 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.0 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.66 percent. For 2021 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.22 percent on OPB plans. We decreased the EROA assumption following an assessment of the historical and anticipated long-term returns of various asset classes, including consideration of recent Federal Reserve policy changes that are expected to extend the duration of the current low interest rate environment. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2020 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2021 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease25 Basis Point Increase2021 pension and OPB expense (benefit)$88 $(88)-40-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION In addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2021 MTM expense (benefit):$ in millions100 Basis Point Decrease100 Basis Point Increase 2021 MTM expense (benefit)$351 $(351)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values, as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the RPEC issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. In October 2020, the RPEC released a new projection scale (MP-2020) that included a reshaping of the long-term mortality improvement assumption. The MP-2020 projection scale includes long-term mortality improvement assumptions greater than 1.0% at earlier ages, but trends down more rapidly than the prior projection scales. After considering the information released by the RPEC in October 2020, we adopted the full MP-2020 projection scale while continuing to use the Pri-2012 White Collar table. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2020, and the amounts estimated for our 2021 pension and OPB expense.For further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters – We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. Income Tax Matters – The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in -41-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations. During 2020, we increased our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $346 million, primarily related to state apportionment, our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs, and the 2017 Tax Act.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible AssetsOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. During 2020, we considered COVID-19-related impacts on our business and determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.We test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.-42-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.OTHER MATTERSOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.-43-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $396 million at December 31, 2020. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we have $15.0 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $18.2 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2020, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $133 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2020, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.-44-",2023-12-30 20:38:33.815953
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).Disposition of IT and Mission Support Services BusinessEffective January 30, 2021 (the “Divestiture date”), we completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former IS&S division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former CIMS division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the disposition.COVID-19COVID-19 was first reported in late 2019. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the President declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak. In the almost two years since then, the pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including millions of confirmed cases and deaths, business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortfalls, supply chain challenges, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. We discussed in some detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and subsequent SEC filings in 2021, the pandemic, its impacts and risks, and actions taken up to the time of each filing. In this Form 10-K, we provide a further update. The company’s leadership, our crisis management and business resumption teams, and local site leadership continue closely to monitor and address the pandemic and related developments, including the impact on our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities. The company has considered and continues to consider and be guided by health data and evolving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in particular, as well as other health organizations globally, federal, state and local governmental authorities, and our customers, among others. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support continued performance, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers. Our goals have been, and continue to be to lessen the potential adverse impacts, both health and economic, and to continue to position the company for long-term success. Like the communities in which we operate, our actions have varied depending on the spread of COVID-19 and applicable government requirements, the needs of our employees, the needs of our customers and the needs of our business. Over the course of 2021, COVID-19 case rates and the health and economic impacts of the pandemic fluctuated dramatically in different communities in the U.S. and globally, particularly with the spread of new variants. But we continued to see a prolonged impact on the economy, our industry, and our company, with increased challenges for customers and suppliers, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, and increasing inflation, among other impacts. We expect these and other impacts to continue and they could worsen, depending on the future course of the pandemic and actions taken in connection with it. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines and the government began extensive efforts to administer them. The company also has taken various steps to encourage and facilitate vaccination access for our employees, in accordance with federal guidance. We have provided paid leave and flexibility for employees to get vaccinated, and strongly encouraged our workforce to take care of themselves and their colleagues. In September 2021, the White House issued an executive order and guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force broadly requiring many U.S.-based federal contractors to be fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021 (or to have an approved accommodation). In early November 2021, the federal government extended that deadline to January 18, 2022. On December 7, 2021, a federal district judge issued an order, temporarily suspending the government from enforcing the federal contractor mandate. That order is on appeal. State and local governments are also taking actions related to the pandemic, imposing additional and varying requirements on industry. We have taken and are taking steps strongly to encourage our employees to be fully vaccinated (or to have an approved accommodation) to protect our workplace and to position the company to comply with the executive order, guidance, and related contract terms, if and as necessary, as we continue to evaluate the evolving situation and our customers’ requirements. Evolving government requirements, including regarding a vaccine mandate, along with the broader impacts of the continuing pandemic, could significantly impact -31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION our workforce and performance, as well as those of our suppliers, and result in costs that we may not be able to recover fully. The company continues to take robust actions globally to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, and to serve our customers with continued performance. We also continue to take steps to support our suppliers, with a particular focus on critical small and midsized business partners, including passing through increased progress payments from the DoD to our suppliers and accelerating payments to certain suppliers.The company’s fourth quarter 2021 revenue and operating income were affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company and the broader economic environment, including through a tightened labor market, elevated levels of employee leave, evolving government requirements, and supply chain challenges. These factors are expected to continue and could worsen and affect further our ability (and that of our suppliers) to maintain a qualified workforce and to perform fully for our customers (including with respect to cost and schedule), with delayed or reduced sales and additional liabilities, losses and costs, that we may not be able to recover fully. Our employees, customers and suppliers, the company, our economy and our global community face both continuing and new or evolving challenges related to the pandemic, and we cannot predict how this dynamic situation will evolve or the impact it will have on the company, or our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. For further information on the pandemic and the potential impact to the company of COVID-19, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and “Risk Factors.”Global Security and Economic EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. Global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities.The global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty. Geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2022 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility and the COVID-19 pandemic. The global economy may also be affected by the residual legal, regulatory and economic impacts of Britain’s exit from the European Union, the full impacts of which are complex and gradually becoming evident. Rising inflation also could lead to increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for the federal government, which could impact other spending priorities. Additionally, economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. U.S. Political and Economic EnvironmentOn May 28, 2021, the Administration released its budget request for FY 2022. The budget proposed $753 billion for national defense programs and $770 billion in non-defense discretionary funding. It continues to be the subject of debate in Congress. The Administration’s budget request included funding for an infrastructure and economic recovery plan and an education and economic support plan. On November 15, 2021, the President signed into law the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Investment and Jobs Act. Enactment of the infrastructure plan and any future spending plans, as well as the costs of the pandemic (as discussed more above), may have broader implications for the defense industry, our customers’ budgets and priorities, and the overall economic environment, including the national debt. It is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. However, the threat to U.S. national security remains very substantial. We believe that our capabilities, particularly in space, missiles, missile defense, hypersonics, counter-hypersonics, survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers defend against future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable growth in our business.FY 2022 appropriations have not been enacted to date. On September 30, 2021, a continuing resolution was enacted, providing funding generally at FY 2021 levels through December 3, 2021; the continuing resolution was further extended through February 18, 2022. Congressional deliberations over FY 2022 appropriations have demonstrated broad support for national security, with increased funding proposed in certain areas for national defense above the Administration’s budget request. It remains uncertain whether and, if so, when the government will approve FY 2022 appropriations, with which programs funded at what levels, and for how long the government will operate under a continuing resolution, with potential impacts on our programs and new starts, in particular. -32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 suspended the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. In October 2021, the statutory debt limit was increased by $480 billion and, in December 2021, was further increased by $2.5 trillion, which is currently expected to allow the Treasury Department to finance the government into 2023. The political environment, federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular.For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to the applicable FAR and CAS requirements that govern our U.S. government business, most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume related changes in profitability. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”). Organic sales is defined as total sales excluding sales attributable to the company's IT services divestiture. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying sales growth as well as in providing an understanding of our ongoing business and future sales trends by presenting the company’s sales before the impact of divestiture activity. Transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted EPS) exclude impacts related to the IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. They also exclude the impact of mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) benefit/(expense) and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of divestiture activity and pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of the IT services divestiture and MTM accounting are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.-33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts20212020201920212020Sales$35,667 $36,799 $33,841 (3)%9 %Operating costs and expenses31,996 32,734 29,872 (2)%10 %Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales89.7 %89.0 %88.3 %Gain on sale of business1,980 — — NMNMOperating income5,651 4,065 3,969 39 %2 %Operating margin rate15.8 %11.0 %11.7 %Mark-to-market pension and OPB benefit (expense)2,355 (1,034)(1,800)(328)%(43)%Federal and foreign income tax expense1,933 539 300 259 %80 %Effective income tax rate21.6 %14.5 %11.8 %Net earnings7,005 3,189 2,248 120 %42 %Diluted earnings per share43.54 19.03 13.22 129 %44 %SalesThe tables below reconcile sales to organic sales:Year Ended December 3120212020$ in millionsSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesOrganic sales % changeAeronautics Systems$11,259 $— $11,259 $12,169 $— $12,169 (7)%Defense Systems5,776 (106)5,670 7,543 (1,637)5,906 (4)%Mission Systems10,134 (42)10,092 10,080 (527)9,553 6 %Space Systems10,608 (16)10,592 8,744 (182)8,562 24 %Intersegment eliminations(2,110)2 (2,108)(1,737)17 (1,720)Total$35,667 $(162)$35,505 $36,799 $(2,329)$34,470 3 %Year Ended December 3120202019$ in millionsSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesOrganic sales % changeAeronautics Systems$12,169 $— $12,169 $11,116 $— $11,116 9 %Defense Systems7,543 (1,637)5,906 7,495 (1,594)5,901 — %Mission Systems10,080 (527)9,553 9,410 (555)8,855 8 %Space Systems8,744 (182)8,562 7,425 (180)7,245 18 %Intersegment eliminations(1,737)17 (1,720)(1,605)24 (1,581)Total$36,799 $(2,329)$34,470 $33,841 $(2,305)$31,536 9 %2021 sales decreased $1.1 billion, or 3 percent, due to a $2.2 billion reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. 2021 organic sales increased $1.0 billion, or 3 percent due to higher sales at Space and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Aeronautics Systems and Defense Systems. 2020 sales included a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at Aeronautics Systems.See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. -34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Operating Income and Margin Rate2021 operating income increased $1.6 billion, or 39 percent, primarily due to the IT services divestiture, including the $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallocated corporate expense for unallowable state taxes and transaction costs, partially offset by a $288 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. Lower non-divestiture-related unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by higher deferred state taxes principally related to the company’s 2021 MTM benefit. 2021 operating margin rate increased to 15.8 percent from 11.0 percent reflecting the items above.2021 G&A costs as a percentage of sales increased to 10.1 percent from 9.3 percent, primarily due to an increase in investments for future business opportunities and a lower G&A cost mix in the divested IT services business.For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.Mark-to-Market Pension and OPB Benefit/ExpenseThe primary components of pre-tax MTM benefit (expense) are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202120202019Actuarial gains (losses) on projected benefit obligation$1,163 $(3,570)$(4,866)Actuarial gains on plan assets 1,192 2,536 3,066 MTM benefit (expense)$2,355 $(1,034)$(1,800)2021 MTM benefit of $2.4 billion was primarily driven by a 30 basis point increase in the discount rate from year end 2020 and actual net plan asset returns of approximately 10.9 percent compared to our 7.5 percent asset return assumption.Federal and Foreign Income TaxesThe 2021 effective tax rate (ETR) increased to 21.6 percent from 14.5 percent in the prior year period primarily due to federal income taxes resulting from the IT services divestiture, including $250 million of income tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business. The company’s 2021 MTM benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR; however, MTM expense in 2020 reduced the 2020 ETR by 1.3 percentage points.

Transaction-adjusted EPS increased $1.98, or 8 percent, reflecting a 4 percent increase in transaction-adjusted net earnings and a 4 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aeronautics SystemsDefense SystemsMission SystemsSpace SystemsAutonomous SystemsBattle Management & Missile SystemsAirborne Multifunction SensorsLaunch & Strategic MissilesManned AircraftMission ReadinessMaritime/Land Systems & SensorsSpaceNavigation, Targeting & SurvivabilityNetworked Information SolutionsEffective during the first quarter of 2021 within Mission Systems, the businesses of the former CIMS business area that remained with Northrop Grumman after the IT services divestiture were merged with the Communications business unit and F-35 Communications, Navigation and Identification programs within the former Airborne, Sensors & Networks business area to form the Networked Information Solutions business area. The Airborne Sensors & Networks business area was then renamed the Airborne Multifunction Sensors business area to better reflect its new portfolio. This change had no impact on the segment operating results of Mission Systems as a whole.-37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION This section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rate. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Higher operating income at Space Systems and Mission Systems was driven by increased volume and improved performance. Lower operating income at Defense Systems is due to the impact of the IT services divestiture and lower operating income at Aeronautics Systems principally relates to net unfavorable EAC adjustments on F-35. 2021 segment operating income from the IT services business was $20 million as compared to $247 million in 2020. Segment operating income includes a first quarter 2021 benefit of approximately $100 million due to the impact of lower overhead rates on the company’s fixed price contracts. Segment operating margin rate increased to 11.8 percent from 11.4 percent and reflects higher operating margin rates at Mission Systems, Defense Systems and Space Systems. FAS/CAS Operating AdjustmentThe decrease in our 2021 FAS/CAS operating adjustment is due to lower CAS pension expense resulting from favorable plan asset returns in 2020 and changes in certain CAS actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2020.Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense)The increase in 2021 unallocated corporate income (expense) is primarily due to a $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of our IT services business, partially offset by $192 million of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestiture. Lower non-divestiture-related unallocated corporate expense reflects a $60 million benefit from insurance settlements related to shareholder litigation involving the former Orbital ATK prior to the company’s acquisition, that was resolved in June 2019, as well as benefits recognized during the year associated with changes in deferred state taxes, partially offset by higher deferred state tax expense related to the company’s 2021 MTM benefit. -38-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Net Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.

Maritime/Land Systems and Sensors sales increased primarily due to $137 million higher volume on G/ATOR and higher marine systems volume. Airborne Multifunction Sensors sales increased principally due to $105 million higher volume on airborne radar programs, including SABR, and higher restricted sales, partially offset by lower volume on airborne electronic warfare programs. Navigation, Targeting and Survivability sales increased principally due to $124 million higher intercompany volume largely related to GBSD ramp-up. Networked Information Solutions sales increased principally due to higher volume on electronic warfare programs, including JCREW, and higher intercompany volume, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 CNI programs.Operating Income2021 operating income increased $120 million, or 8 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate and higher sales. Operating margin rate increased to 15.6 percent from 14.5 percent due to higher net favorable EAC adjustments, which reflect improved performance and the first quarter 2021 reduction in overhead rates, the favorable resolution of certain government accounting matters in the second quarter of 2021 and mix changes largely related to the IT services divestiture.SPACE SYSTEMS Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20212020201920212020Sales$10,608 $8,744 $7,425 21 %18 %Operating income1,121 893 794 26 %12 %Operating margin rate10.6 %10.2 %10.7 %Sales2021 sales increased $1.9 billion, or 21 percent, due to higher volume in both the Launch & Strategic Missiles and Space business areas, partially offset by a $166 million reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. 2021 organic sales increased $2.0 billion, or 24 percent. Launch & Strategic Missiles sales increased primarily due to ramp-up on development programs, including a $1.1 billion increase on GBSD and a $206 million increase on NGI. Space sales were driven by higher volume on restricted programs and increases of $192 million on Artemis and $140 million on Next Gen OPIR.Operating Income2021 operating income increased $228 million, or 26 percent, due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate.

The increase was partially offset by lower restricted sales and lower net favorable EAC adjustments at Aeronautics Systems as well as close-out of the Lake City contract at Defense Systems. 2021 product costs increased $676 million, or 3 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above.Service Sales and Costs2021 service sales decreased $2.0 billion, or 20 percent, primarily due to the IT services divestiture. Year to date 2021 sales from the IT services business, which were largely included in service sales, were $162 million as compared to $2.3 billion in the prior year period. The reductions associated with the IT services divestiture were partially offset by higher volume on the ROK Global Hawk CLS and CBP P-3 programs at Defense Systems.2021 service costs decreased $1.8 billion, or 21 percent, consistent with the lower service sales described above.BACKLOGBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options -41-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020: 20212020$ in millionsFundedUnfundedTotalBacklogTotalBacklog% Change in 2021Aeronautics Systems$8,842 $9,435 $18,277 $24,002 (24)%Defense Systems5,802 547 6,349 8,131 (22)%Mission Systems9,940 4,366 14,306 13,805 4 %Space Systems6,210 30,904 37,114 35,031 6 %Total backlog$30,794 $45,252 $76,046 $80,969 (6)%2021 net awards totaled $32.1 billion. Significant 2021 new awards include $6.1 billion for restricted programs (primarily at Space Systems, Mission Systems and Aeronautics Systems), $3.2 billion for the SLS Booster Production and Operations Contract, $2.6 billion for NGI, $2.2 billion for F-35, $1.0 billion for E-2 and $0.9 billion for NASA’s HALO module. In connection with the IT services divestiture, the company reduced backlog by $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2021 ($1.0 billion at Defense Systems, $0.2 billion at Mission Systems and $0.2 billion at Space Systems).LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company’s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and OPB plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion; $295 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. We expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the SEC, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion, and in April 2021, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. At December 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under these credit facilities.The company’s principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. At December 31, 2021, we had $17.7 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. Purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under U.S. government contracts. In most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our U.S. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. As such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. At December 31, 2021, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.5 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. We also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $1.6 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. At this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions. Refer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs (Note 3), commercial paper, credit facilities and long-term debt (Note 10), standby letters of credit and guarantees (Note 12), future minimum contributions for the company’s pension and OPB plans (Note 13), and lease payment obligations (Note 15). COVID-19 and the CARES ActThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) established a program with provisions to allow U.S. companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022. Our first installment of deferred social security taxes of $200 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second installment of $200 million is due in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under Section 3610, the CARES Act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of COVID-19. The company continues to seek, and anticipates continuing to seek, recovery for certain COVID-19-related costs under Section -42-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 3610 of the CARES Act and through our contract provisions, though it is unclear what funds will be available and how much we will be able to recover. In addition, the DoD has, to date, taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts; it is unclear what steps the DoD will continue to take.Cash Flow MeasuresIn addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202120202019Net earnings$7,005 $3,189 $2,248 Gain on sale of business(1,980)— — Non-cash items(1)(1,510)1,799 2,251 Pension and OPB contributions(141)(887)(263)Changes in trade working capital181 227 128 Other, net12 (23)(67)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,567 $4,305 $4,297 (1)Includes depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, MTM benefit (expense), stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and OPB income.2021 cash provided by operating activities decreased $738 million principally due to federal and state taxes of $785 million paid in connection with the IT services divestiture. Lower 2021 pension and OPB contributions were largely offset by the impact of CARES Act social security tax deferrals and the 2020 increase in DoD progress payment rates.Adjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20212020201920212020Net cash provided by operating activities$3,567 $4,305 $4,297 (17)%— %Capital expenditures(1,415)(1,420)(1,264)— %12 %Proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer84 205 — (59)%NMAfter-tax discretionary pension contributions— 593 95 (100)%524 %Adjusted free cash flow$2,236 $3,683 $3,128 (39)%18 %2021 adjusted free cash flow decreased $1.4 billion, principally due to federal and state taxes of $785 million paid related to the IT services divestiture as well as the impact of CARES Act social security tax deferrals and the 2020 increase in DoD progress payment rates. -43-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Investing Cash Flow2021 net cash provided by investing activities was $2.1 billion compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1.2 billion in the prior year, principally due to $3.4 billion in cash received from the sale of our IT services business during the first quarter of 2021.Financing Cash Flow2021 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.6 billion, principally due to an increase of $3.2 billion in share repurchases and $1.2 billion in debt repayments. 2020 net cash used in financing activities included $2.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates, as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the -44-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 2.98 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2.68 percent at December 31, 2020.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2021 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2021 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2021 MTM expense (benefit), and 2022 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2021 pension and OPB obligation and MTM expense (benefit)$1,343 $(1,274)2022 pension and OPB (benefit) expense(44)40 Cash Balance Crediting Rate – A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate used for FAS purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to the minimum threshold of 2.25 percent as of December 31, 2021, and will remain at 2.25 percent through 2027. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2021 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2021 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2021 MTM expense (benefit), and 2022 expected pension expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2021 pension obligation and MTM expense (benefit)$— $151 2022 pension (benefit) expense— 10 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.During 2021, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations. The current asset allocation is approximately 40% public equities, 30% fixed-income, 25% -45-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION alternatives and 5% cash. At this time, the Investment Committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2021 was approximately 11.2 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 8.8 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2021 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 10.9 percent.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.For determining 2021 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.22 percent. For 2022 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.19 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2021 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2022 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease25 Basis Point Increase2022 pension and OPB expense (benefit)$92 $(92)In addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2022 MTM expense (benefit):$ in millions100 Basis Point Decrease100 Basis Point Increase 2022 MTM expense (benefit)$369 $(369)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (NAV), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the RPEC issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. In October 2021, the RPEC released a new projection scale (MP-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.After considering the information released by the RPEC in October 2021 as well as the company’s recent mortality experience in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted the full MP-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the Pri-2012 White Collar table. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2021, and the amounts estimated for our 2022 pension and OPB expense.For further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is -46-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters – We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. Income Tax Matters – The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations. Our 2021 increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $149 million was primarily related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes related final revenue recognition regulations issued in December 2020 under IRC Section 451(b) and procedural guidance issued in August 2021. For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible AssetsOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.-47-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. During 2021, we considered COVID-19-related impacts on our business and determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.We test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.-48-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $418 million at December 31, 2021. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, we have $12.8 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $15.1 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2021, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $120 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2021, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKWe have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts. Bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance.-49-",2023-12-30 20:38:38.130143
1133421,NOC,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP /DE/,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).Global Security EnvironmentThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. Our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by global events, including violence and unrest. The same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.The conflict in Ukraine has increased global tensions and instability, highlighted threats and increased global demand, as well as further disrupted global supply chains and added costs. We have experienced a modest increase in demand for certain of our goods and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in the Ukraine. We also have experienced a slight disruption to some of our programs and supply chain, including unanticipated cost growth, as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions. However, we do not have sizable business dealings in Russia or Ukraine, and do not anticipate significant adverse impacts from the ongoing conflict.More broadly, the conflict in Ukraine and threats elsewhere have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, especially in Europe and the Pacific region, as well as the U.S. We have started to see, and expect to continue to see, increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. We are actively exploring both opportunities and risks.For further information on the global security environment, including the risks related thereto, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks” and “Risk Factors.”Global Health and Economic EnvironmentCOVID-19Since at least March 2020, when it was first characterized as a global pandemic, COVID-19 has dramatically impacted and continues to impact the global health and economic environments, including millions of confirmed cases and deaths, business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortfalls, supply chain challenges, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility. We discussed in some detail in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and subsequent SEC filings, the pandemic, its impacts and risks, and actions taken up to the time of each filing. In this Form 10-K, we provide a further update.In 2022, the pandemic continued to have significant adverse impacts on the global health and macroeconomic environments, particularly with the spread of new variants and other viruses and illnesses, ongoing disruption of the labor force and supply chains, continued inflation, and market volatility and uncertainties. We expect such adverse impacts to continue. However, with extraordinary efforts by our employees, our governments and customers, our partners and our company, direct COVID-19-related impacts on our business generally declined in 2022. While we cannot predict the future course of the pandemic or its consequences, we are not currently assuming significant additional direct COVID-19 related impacts on our business.The company continues to work to monitor and address the pandemic, including its impact on our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities. Our goals have been, and continue to be, to keep our employees safe, to lessen the potential adverse impacts, both health and economic, and to continue to position the company for long-term success. Like the communities in which we operate, our actions have varied, and will continue to vary, depending on the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses, applicable government requirements, and the needs of our stakeholders.Global Economic EnvironmentIn part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages (especially in critical skill areas); and market volatility. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited -30-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers. For example, as discussed in greater detail in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, our latest estimated cost to complete the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of the B-21 program reflects updated estimates for adverse impacts from these macroeconomic factors, as well as potential opportunities to address them.We continue to work hard to mitigate some of the challenges caused by the current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by taking steps to support our suppliers and small businesses and enhancing our workforce through extensive hiring, development and retention efforts. However, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, continued adversely to affect the company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2022. We cannot clearly predict how long these macroeconomic challenges will continue, or how they will change over time, or what additional resources will be available, but we expect to see this challenging macroeconomic environment continue adversely to impact the global economy, our customers, our industry and our company in 2023.In addition, increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for governments, could further impact government spending priorities (in the U.S. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. Economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions.U.S. Political, Budget and Regulatory EnvironmentOn March 15, 2022, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2022, which provided full-year funding for federal agencies, including $782 billion for national defense. This represented an approximately $42 billion or 6 percent increase above the budget for FY 2021, approximately $30 billion more than the Administration had initially requested. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall national defense budget for FY 2022 was $743 billion. On March 28, 2022, the President proposed his budget for FY 2023, which included $813 billion for national defense programs, approximately $31 billion or 4 percent higher than what was appropriated in FY 2022. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall requested national defense budget was $773 billion.On December 23, 2022, the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2023, which supports approximately $858 billion in FY 2023 funding for national defense, $817 billion of which is for the DoD. In addition, the FY 2023 NDAA grants DoD discretionary authority under limited circumstances to provide extraordinary relief to contractors to address certain inflationary impacts. Although discussions have occurred, DoD has not yet issued written guidance for how it intends to exercise this authority.On December 29, 2022, the President signed an Omnibus appropriations act for FY 2023 that provided $858 billion for national defense programs, approximately $45 billion more than the Administration initially requested for FY 2023 and approximately $76 billion or 10 percent higher than what was appropriated in FY 2022. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall national defense budget for FY 2023 is $817 billion. It includes up to $1 billion for extraordinary relief in FY 2023.In addition to the U.S. national security spending detailed above, the U.S. has pledged over $100 billion in security assistance to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine across FY 2022 and FY 2023, including approximately $50 billion in DoD spending. Assistance includes transfers of weapons systems from U.S. inventories, orders for production of additional weapons systems, both to backfill U.S. stockpiles and for Ukraine directly, and assistance from U.S. capabilities.It is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. Current and future requirements related to the conflict in Ukraine, threats in the Pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, the costs of the pandemic and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the U.S. and globally, will continue to impact our customers’ budgets and priorities, and our industry. Current tensions within Congress and the wider U.S. political environment may also impact defense budgets and government spending more broadly. We believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to our nation and our allies, and the need for strong deterrence and a robust defense capability. We believe that our capabilities, particularly in space, C4ISR, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the U.S. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth.The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 suspended the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. In October 2021, the statutory debt limit was increased by $480 billion and, in December 2021, it was further increased by $2.5 trillion, which is -31-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION currently expected to allow the Treasury Department to finance the government into 2023. In January 2023, the debt ceiling was reached and the Treasury Department began taking “extraordinary measures” to finance the government and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling. We expect statutory action will be needed in 2023 to increase or suspend the debt ceiling. During the third quarter of 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022, which includes an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit, among other provisions, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax and a one percent excise tax on share repurchases, among other provisions, were signed into law. We expect the excise tax on share repurchases to impact us beginning in 2023; however, we do not expect this tax or any other provision of this legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. More broadly, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, an accelerated pace of new rulemakings, new and expanded uses of existing authorities, changing legal rulings and landscapes, and aggressive enforcement actions. These changes and the accelerated pace of change, not only impose additional obligations and risk, but also create further uncertainty regarding our operating environment. The political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary environment and political tensions. The results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. We anticipate that the broader macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflationary pressures, labor challenges, and supply chain disruption, among other considerations, will continue to play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and, in turn, on our industry and company.For further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”Disposition of IT and Mission Support Services BusinessEffective January 30, 2021 (the “Divestiture date”), we completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former IS&S division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former CIMS division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the year ended December 31, 2022.The company recorded pre-tax profit of the IT and mission support services business of $20 million and $247 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Operating Performance Assessment and ReportingWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to the applicable FAR and CAS requirements that govern our U.S. government business, most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.In evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net EAC adjustments. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).-32-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”). Organic sales is defined as total sales excluding sales attributable to the company's IT services divestiture. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying sales growth as well as in providing an understanding of our ongoing business and future sales trends by presenting the company’s sales before the impact of divestiture activity. Transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted EPS) exclude impacts related to the IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. They also exclude the impact of mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) benefit/(expense) and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of divestiture activity and pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of the IT services divestiture and MTM accounting are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions, except per share amounts20222021202020222021Sales$36,602 $35,667 $36,799 3 %(3)%Operating costs and expenses33,001 31,996 32,734 3 %(2)%Operating costs and expenses as a % of sales90.2 %89.7 %89.0 %Gain on sale of business— 1,980 — NMNMOperating income3,601 5,651 4,065 (36)%39 %Operating margin rate9.8 %15.8 %11.0 %Mark-to-market pension and OPB benefit (expense) 1,232 2,355 (1,034)(48)%(328)%Federal and foreign income tax expense940 1,933 539 (51)%259 %Effective income tax rate16.1 %21.6 %14.5 %Net earnings4,896 7,005 3,189 (30)%120 %Diluted earnings per share$31.47 $43.54 $19.03 (28)%129 %-33-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION SalesThe tables below reconcile sales to organic sales:Year Ended December 3120222021$ in millionsSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesOrganic sales % changeAeronautics Systems$10,531 $— $10,531 $11,259 $— $11,259 (6)%Defense Systems5,579 — 5,579 5,776 (106)5,670 (2)%Mission Systems10,396 — 10,396 10,134 (42)10,092 3 %Space Systems12,275 — 12,275 10,608 (16)10,592 16 %Intersegment eliminations(2,179)— (2,179)(2,110)2 (2,108)Total$36,602 $— $36,602 $35,667 $(162)$35,505 3 %Year Ended December 3120212020$ in millionsSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesSalesIT services salesOrganicsalesOrganic sales % changeAeronautics Systems$11,259 $— $11,259 $12,169 $— $12,169 (7)%Defense Systems5,776 (106)5,670 7,543 (1,637)5,906 (4)%Mission Systems10,134 (42)10,092 10,080 (527)9,553 6 %Space Systems10,608 (16)10,592 8,744 (182)8,562 24 %Intersegment eliminations(2,110)2 (2,108)(1,737)17 (1,720)Total$35,667 $(162)$35,505 $36,799 $(2,329)$34,470 3 %2022 sales increased $935 million and 2022 organic sales increased $1.1 billion, or 3 percent, due to higher sales at Space Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Aeronautics Systems and Defense Systems. 2022 sales reflect strong demand, the timing of material receipts and improving trends in labor availability during the second half of the year. See “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. Operating Income and Margin Rate2022 operating income decreased $2.1 billion, or 36 percent, primarily due to a $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallocated corporate expenses recognized in the prior year associated with the IT services divestiture. Operating income also decreased due to a $330 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, which more than offset higher segment operating income and lower non-divestiture-related unallocated corporate expense. 2022 operating margin rate declined to 9.8 percent from 15.8 percent reflecting the items above.2022 G&A costs as a percentage of sales increased to 10.6 percent from 10.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in investments for future business opportunities.For further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.-34-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Mark-to-Market Pension and OPB Benefit/ExpenseThe primary components of pre-tax MTM benefit (expense) are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202220212020Actuarial gains (losses) on projected benefit obligation$9,662 $1,163 $(3,570)Actuarial (losses) gains on plan assets (8,430)1,192 2,536 MTM benefit (expense)$1,232 $2,355 $(1,034)2022 MTM benefit (expense) of $1.2 billion was primarily driven by a 256 basis point increase in the discount rate from year end 2021, partially offset by losses of 15.4 percent on plan assets compared to our 7.5 percent asset return assumption.Federal and Foreign Income TaxesThe 2022 effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to 16.1 percent from 21.6 percent primarily due to an $86 million benefit resulting from the resolution of the IRS examination of certain legacy OATK tax returns, as well as additional federal income taxes in the prior year resulting from the IT services divestiture. The company’s 2022 MTM benefit increased the 2022 ETR by 1.2 percentage points; however, the 2021 MTM benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR.

Transaction-adjusted EPS was comparable with the prior year and reflects a 4 percent reduction in transaction-adjusted net earnings and a 3 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTSBasis of PresentationThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”We present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:Aeronautics SystemsDefense SystemsMission SystemsSpace SystemsAutonomous SystemsBattle Management & Missile SystemsAirborne Multifunction SensorsLaunch & Strategic MissilesManned AircraftMission ReadinessMaritime/Land Systems & SensorsSpaceNavigation, Targeting & SurvivabilityNetworked Information SolutionsThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rate. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below. -36-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Segment Operating Income and Margin RateSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Segment operating margin rate decreased to 11.6 percent from 11.8 percent principally due to lower net EAC adjustments due, in part, to macroeconomic impacts, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. FAS/CAS Operating AdjustmentThe decrease in our 2022 FAS/CAS operating adjustment is due to lower CAS pension expense resulting from favorable plan asset returns in 2021 and changes in certain CAS actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2021.Unallocated Corporate Expense (Income)The change in 2022 unallocated corporate expense (income) is primarily due to the prior year $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the IT services divestiture. -37-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Net Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments - We record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.

Operating Income2022 operating income increased $23 million, or 2 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate, partially offset by lower sales. 2022 operating margin rate increased to 10.6 percent from 9.7 percent primarily due to higher net favorable EAC adjustments and a $38 million gain on a property sale. Higher net favorable EAC adjustments reflect $133 million of positive adjustments on the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the B-21 program, partially offset by lower net EAC adjustments associated with other restricted work, as well as $135 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on F-35 in the prior year.

The increase at Space Systems was driven by ramp-up on development programs including GBSD and NGI, as well as higher volume on the SDA Tranche 1 Transport Layer and Tranche 1 Tracking Layer programs. The decrease at Aeronautics Systems was principally due to lower volume on restricted programs, as well as the Global Hawk and E-2 programs. 2022 product costs increased $600 million, or 2 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above.Service Sales and Costs2022 service sales increased $281 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to an increase in service sales at Aeronautics Systems, principally on restricted programs, partially offset by a decrease in service sales at Defense Systems. The decrease at Defense Systems was driven by lower scope on an international training program, the impact of the IT services divestiture, completion of a Joint Services support program and wind-down of the UKAWACS program. Sales from the divested IT services business, which were largely included in service sales, were $162 million in the prior year. 2022 service costs increased $299 million, or 4 percent, consistent with the higher service sales described above.-41-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION BACKLOGBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.Backlog consisted of the following at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 20222021$ in millionsFundedUnfundedTotalBacklogTotalBacklog% Change in 2022Aeronautics Systems$8,458 $10,939 $19,397 $18,277 6 %Defense Systems5,881 1,634 7,515 6,349 18 %Mission Systems9,835 4,040 13,875 14,306 (3)%Space Systems8,317 29,639 37,956 37,114 2 %Total backlog$32,491 $46,252 $78,743 $76,046 4 %2022 net awards totaled $39.3 billion.

As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion; $316 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. We expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the SEC, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, and in April 2022, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.The company’s principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. At December 31, 2022, we had $19.0 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. Purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under U.S. government contracts. In most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our U.S. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. As such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. At December 31, 2022, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.5 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. We also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. At this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions. Refer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs (Note 3), commercial paper, credit facilities and long-term debt (Note 10), standby letters of credit and guarantees (Note 12), future minimum contributions for the company’s pension and OPB plans (Note 13), and lease payment obligations (Note 15). COVID-19 and the CARES ActThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) established a program with provisions to allow U.S. companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022. Our first installment of deferred social security taxes of $200 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second installment of $200 million was -42-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION paid in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under Section 3610, the CARES Act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of COVID-19. The company has sought and may continue to seek recovery for certain COVID-19-related costs under Section 3610 of the CARES Act and through our contract provisions, though it is unclear what funds will be available and how much we will be able to recover. In addition, the DoD has taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts; it is unclear how long the 90 percent progress payment rate will remain in place and whether the DoD will take any further steps.Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. Our 2022 cash from operations were reduced by approximately $900 million for federal tax payments we made related to Section 174. In the future, Congress may consider legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. In the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current Section 174 tax law. The impact of Section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the IRS issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things. Cash Flow MeasuresIn addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.Operating Cash FlowThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: Year Ended December 31$ in millions202220212020Net earnings$4,896 $7,005 $3,189 Gain on sale of business— (1,980)— Non-cash items(1)(1,305)(1,510)1,799 Pension and OPB contributions(136)(141)(887)Changes in trade working capital(600)181 227 Other, net46 12 (23)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,901 $3,567 $4,305 (1)Includes depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, MTM benefit (expense), stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and OPB income.2022 cash provided by operating activities decreased $666 million principally due to lower CAS pension recoveries and changes in trade working capital, including approximately $900 million of federal tax payments related to the Section 174 tax legislation described above. The prior year included $785 million of tax payments related to the IT services divestiture.Adjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.-43-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:Year Ended December 31% Change in$ in millions20222021202020222021Net cash provided by operating activities$2,901 $3,567 $4,305 (19)%(17)%Capital expenditures(1,435)(1,415)(1,420)1 %— %Proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer155 84 205 85 %(59)%After-tax discretionary pension contributions— — 593 NM(100)%Adjusted free cash flow$1,621 $2,236 $3,683 (28)%(39)%2022 adjusted free cash flow decreased $615 million principally due to lower net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer. Investing Cash Flow2022 net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.1 billion in the prior year, principally due to $3.4 billion in cash received from the sale of our IT services business during the first quarter of 2021. Financing Cash Flow2022 net cash used in financing activities decreased $4.4 billion principally due to a $2.2 billion decrease in debt repayments and a $2.2 billion reduction in share repurchases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations. We also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract EACs that span several years. For example, during 2022, we included in our EACs management’s best estimate of the impact inflation has had and may continue to have on our contracts. We also included our current best estimate of the impact on our EACs of disruptions we have experienced and continue to experience in the supply chain. The volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our year end 2022 contract EACs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.-44-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION We generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. As a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Retirement BenefitsOverview – The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Discount Rate – The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.54 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.98 percent at December 31, 2021.The effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2022 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2022 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2022 MTM expense (benefit), and 2023 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2022 pension and OPB obligation and MTM expense (benefit)$817 $(781)2023 pension and OPB (benefit) expense(20)18 -45-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Cash Balance Crediting Rate – A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate used for FAS purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 3.96 percent as of December 31, 2022, declining to 3.88 percent by 2028. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2022 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2022 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2022 MTM expense (benefit), and 2023 expected pension expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease in Rate25 Basis Point Increase in Rate2022 pension obligation and MTM expense (benefit)$(96)$100 2023 pension (benefit) expense(9)9 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets – The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.During 2022, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed the plans’ major asset class allocations and approved an update to increase the target fixed-income asset allocation from 30% to 40%. The current asset allocation is now approximately 35% fixed-income, 30% public equities, 30% alternatives and 5% cash. At this time, the Investment Committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.While historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2022 was approximately 10.7 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 8.6 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2022 losses on plan assets, net of expenses, were approximately 15.4 percent.Consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA. Despite the change in our target asset allocation described above, these models show a year-over-year increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets largely due to recent increases in interest rates, which more than offset the downward pressure on our EROA caused by the change in asset mix.For determining 2022 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.19 percent. For 2023 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.23 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2022 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2023 expected pension and OPB expense:$ in millions25 Basis Point Decrease25 Basis Point Increase2023 pension and OPB expense (benefit)$73 $(73)-46-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION In addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2023 MTM expense (benefit):$ in millions100 Basis Point Decrease100 Basis Point Increase 2023 MTM expense (benefit)$292 $(292)Estimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets – For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (NAV), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.Mortality Rate – Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the RPEC issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. In October 2021, the RPEC released a new projection scale (MP-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.The RPEC did not release a MP-2022 projection scale citing complexities in incorporating the substantial number of “excess deaths” in 2020 into their existing model and uncertainties about future expectations primarily related to COVID-19. As such, after considering the information released by the RPEC in October 2021 as well as the company’s recent mortality experience in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted the full MP-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the Pri-2012 White Collar table. While the amounts and structure of the PRI-2012 base mortality table with the MP-2021 projection scale continues to reflect a reasonable estimate of mortality, we supplemented the table with 50% of the Gradual Wear-Off illustration as outlined in the RPEC’s 2022 Mortality Improvement Update paper to reflect the future impacts of COVID-19. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2022, and the amounts estimated for our 2023 pension and OPB expense.For further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Litigation, Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.Environmental Matters – We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. -47-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Income Tax Matters – The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. We exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations.For further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Long-Lived AssetsOverview – We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. We record property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for capital assets used in operating our business. Depreciation expense associated with our PP&E is generally an allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements. However, depreciation expense associated with PP&E used in our commercial businesses, as well as the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of PP&E acquired through business combinations, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk than the PP&E for which depreciation expense is recovered through our U.S. government contracts.Impairment Testing – We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.In addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. During 2022, we determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.When testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to -48-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.We test for impairment of our long-lived assets, including PP&E and purchased intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.Impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.-49-NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEQUITY RISKWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $332 million at December 31, 2022. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.INTEREST RATE RISKWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we have $12.9 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $12.1 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity. Additionally, if we were to refinance our long-term debt, it may be refinanced at higher interest rates.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2022, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $221 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2022, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows. INFLATION RISKThe global macroeconomic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including the highest rates of inflation in 40 years. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, among other concerns. We cannot predict how long these inflationary pressures will continue, or how they may change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the global economy, our customers, our industry and our company.Historically, we generally have been able to anticipate such increases in costs when pricing our contracts, and our bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts have typically included assumptions regarding cost escalations in amounts that have been sufficient to cover most cost increases over the period of performance, including as offset by operational efficiencies. However, the company, its subcontractors and other suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, increased pressures from recent heightened levels of inflation and the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment, which we have not been able to fully mitigate. If inflationary pressures continue to persist, they may continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.-50-",2023-12-30 20:38:37.767728
