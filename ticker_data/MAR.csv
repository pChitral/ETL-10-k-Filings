1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended January 3, 2003, December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000. Systemwide sales include sales from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Continuing Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 Income from continuing operations, net of taxes increased 63 percent to $439 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $208 million of tax benefits associated with our Synthetic Fuel business and a $44 million gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million charge to write-down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased demand for hotels and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 reflected the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges against continuing operations that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Sales, which exclude sales from our discontinued Distribution Services and Senior Living Services businesses, increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales for our new Synthetic Fuel business and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by the decline in lodging demand. Systemwide sales, excluding sales from discontinued businesses, increased by 6 percent to $18.6 billion in 2002. 2001 Compared to 2000 Income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 45 percent to $269 million and 46 percent to $1.05, respectively. Pretax restructuring and other charges totaling $204 million and lower lodging segment financial results, due to the decline in hotel performance, reduced income from continuing operations. Sales of $7.8 billion in 2001 from our continuing operations were down slightly compared to the prior year, reflecting a decline in hotel performance, partially offset by revenue from new lodging properties. Systemwide sales, excluding sales from our discontinued businesses were $17.5 billion, flat with the prior year. Marriott Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 2002/2001 2001/2000 Sales $ 8,248 $ 7,786 $ 7,911 6 % -2 % Segment financial results before restructuring costs, other charges, goodwill impairment and Interval International gain $ 713 $ 756 $ 936 -6 % -19 % Restructuring costs — (44 ) — nm nm Other charges — (71 ) — nm nm Interval International gain 44 — — nm nm Goodwill impairment (50 ) — — nm nm Segment financial results, as reported $ 707 $ 641 $ 936 10 % -32 % 13 2002 Compared to 2001 Marriott Lodging, which includes our Full-Service, Select-Service, Extended-Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported a 10 percent increase in segment financial results and 6 percent higher sales in 2002. Results reflect a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms. Our revenues from base fees totaled $379 million, an increase of 2 percent. Franchise fees totaled $232 million, an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were $162 million, a decline of 20 percent. The $50 million write-down of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business, ExecuStay, reduced Lodging results in 2002. The 2002 comparisons are also impacted by the $115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded in 2001. 14 We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. Comparable REVPAR, room rate and occupancy statistics used throughout this report are based on North American properties we operate. Statistics for Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites company-operated North American properties are not presented - since these brands only have a few properties that we operate, the information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables below). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide statistics are based on comparable worldwide units reflecting constant foreign exchange rates. Occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table.

Average room rates for these hotels decreased 4.9 percent and occupancy declined slightly to 70.1 percent. International Lodging reported an increase in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in Asia and the United Kingdom. The favorable comparison is also impacted by the restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Marriott Vacation Club International. Financial results increased 24 percent, reflecting a 5 percent increase in contract sales and note sale gains in 2002 of $60 million compared to $40 million in 2001, a gain of $44 million related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation from recently added systems for customer support. Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 188 properties totaling over 31,000 rooms across its brands in 2002, while 25 hotels (approximately 4,700 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: • Thirty-five properties (6,700 rooms), 21 percent of our total room additions for the year, were conversions from other brands. • Approximately 25 percent of new rooms opened were outside the United States. • We added 112 properties (14,500 rooms) to our Select-Service and Extended-Stay Brands. • The opening of new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in France (Disneyland Paris), Spain and a Ritz-Carlton Club in Florida. At year-end 2002, we had 300 hotel properties and more than 50,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development. We expect to open over 150 hotels and timesharing resorts (25,000 - 30,000 rooms) in 2003. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. 2001 Compared to 2000 Marriott Lodging, which includes our Full-Service, Select-Service, Extended-Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported a 32 percent decrease in segment financial results and 2 percent lower sales in 2001. Results reflected restructuring costs of $44 million and other charges of $71 million, including a $36 million reserve for third-party guarantees we expect to fund and not recover out of future cash flow, $12 million of reserves for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible, a write-off of two investments in management contracts and other assets of $8 million, $13 million of losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties, and a $2 million write-off associated with capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform. Results also reflect lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms, partially offset by increased revenue associated with new properties. Incentive management fees declined 36 percent, base management fees declined 3 percent, and franchise fees increased 6 percent. 16 Occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table.

Average room rates for these hotels declined 2 percent, while occupancy declined 6.7 percentage points. International Lodging reported a decrease in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the decline in international travel and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by sales associated with new rooms. Over 35 percent of rooms added in 2001 were outside the United States. Marriott Vacation Club International contributed over 20 percent of lodging segment financial results in 2001, after the impact of restructuring and other charges. Segment financial results increased 7 percent reflecting a 17 22 percent increase in contract sales, the 2001 acquisition of the Grand Residence Club in Lake Tahoe, California, and note sale gains in 2001 of $40 million compared to $22 million in 2000, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and severance expenses of nearly $2 million associated with the Company’s restructuring plan. Corporate Expenses, Interest and Taxes Corporate Expenses Annual Change ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 2002/2001 2001/2000 Corporate expenses before restructuring costs and other charges $ 126 $ 117 $ 120 8 % -3 % Restructuring costs — 18 — nm nm Other charges — 22 — nm nm Corporate expenses, as reported $ 126 $ 157 $ 120 -20 % 31 % 2002 Compared to 2001 Corporate expenses decreased $31 million in 2002 to $126 million reflecting the following: (i) 2002 items, including higher insurance costs, higher litigation expenses, lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan, lower foreign exchange losses and the continued favorable impact of our cost containment initiatives; (ii) 2001 items, including restructuring charges of $18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs, a $35 million write-off of three investments in technology partners (including a $22 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter), $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels. 2001 Compared to 2000 Corporate expenses increased $37 million reflecting the impact of restructuring charges of $18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs, and other charges related to the fourth quarter write-off of a $22 million investment in one of our technology partners. In addition to these items, we also recorded $8 million of foreign exchange losses and in prior quarters we recorded a $13 million write-off of two investments in technology partners. These charges were partially offset by $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing tax credit investments, the favorable impact of cost containment action plans, and the reversal of a long-standing $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our managed hotels. The reversal of the insurance reserve was the result of our conclusion that a settlement could be reached in an amount that would be covered by insurance. We determined that it was no longer probable that the loss contingency would result in a material outlay by us and accordingly, we reversed the reserve during the first quarter of 2001. Interest Expense 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest expense decreased $23 million to $86 million reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates. 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest expense increased $9 million to $109 million reflecting the impact of the issuance of Series E Notes in January 2001 and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, partially offset by lower interest resulting from the payoff of commercial paper. Interest Income and Income Tax 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest income increased $28 million, before reflecting reserves of $12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels. The increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized which were previously 18 deemed uncollectible. The comparison to 2001 also reflects a $6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2002 from 36.1 percent in 2001 primarily due to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business. Excluding the impact of Synthetic Fuel, our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2002 was 39.6 percent. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 35.4 percent to 15.7 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest income increased $34 million, before reflecting reserves of $48 million for loans deemed uncollectible as a result of certain hotels experiencing significant declines in profitability and the owners not being able to meet debt service obligations. The change in interest income was impacted by income associated with higher loan balances, including the loans made to the Courtyard joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset by $6 million of expected guarantee fundings and the impact of $14 million of income recorded in 2000 associated with an international loan that was previously deemed uncollectible. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 36.1 percent in 2001 from 36.6 percent in 2000 as a result of modifications related to our deferred compensation plan and the impact of increased income in countries with lower effective tax rates. Synthetic Fuel In October 2001, we acquired four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities) for $46 million in cash. The Synthetic Fuel produced at the Facilities qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Section 29, tax credits are not available for Synthetic Fuel produced after 2007. We began operating these Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. The operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits, has been, and we expect will continue to be significantly accretive to our net income. Although the Facilities produce significant losses, these are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which reduce our income tax expense. In the fiscal year 2002, our Synthetic Fuel business reflected sales of $193 million and a loss of $134 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $49 million and tax credits of $159 million. In January 2003, we entered into a contract with an unrelated third party to sell approximately a 50 percent interest in the Synthetic Fuel business. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of a satisfactory private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the new ownership structure. Contracts related to the potential sale are being held in escrow until closing conditions are met. If the conditions are not met by August 31, 2003, neither party will have an obligation to perform under the agreements. If the transaction is consummated, we expect to receive $25 million in promissory notes and cash as well as an earnout based on the amount of synthetic fuel produced. If the transaction is consummated, we expect to account for the remaining interest in the Synthetic Fuel business under the equity method of accounting. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services 2002 Compared to 2001 On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc. and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL Retirement Partners, Inc. (CNL) for approximately $259 million in cash. We expect to complete the sale early in 2003. On December 17, 2002, we sold twelve senior living communities to CNL for approximately $89 million in cash. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 66, and we recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million. Also, on December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt, from an unrelated owner. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. We plan to restructure the debt and sell the communities in 2003. Management has approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. Accordingly, at January 3, 2003, the operating results of our Senior Living Services 19 segment are reported in discontinued operations, and the remaining assets are classified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet. As a result of the transactions outlined above, we anticipate a total after-tax charge of $109 million. Since generally accepted accounting principles do not allow gains to be recognized until the underlying transaction closes, we cannot record the estimated after-tax gain of $22 million on the sale of the nine communities to CNL until the sale is completed, which we expect to occur in early 2003. As a result, we have recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million which is included in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. In December 2001, management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months. We recorded an impairment charge of $60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value at December 28, 2001. On October 1, 2002, we completed the sale of these properties for $62 million which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by $11 million. We included the $11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes and excluding the loss on disposal of $131 million, was $23 million, an increase of $52 million over 2001 results. The increase reflects the impact of the 2001 plan to exit the companion living concept and its subsequent execution, higher per diems, recognition of a $2 million one-time pretax payment associated with the sale of the Crestline Senior Living communities to an unaffiliated third-party, lower amortization associated with our adoption of FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,” in the first quarter of 2002 and lower depreciation, partially offset by higher insurance costs. 2001 Compared to 2000 Marriott Senior Living Services posted a 9 percent increase in sales in 2001, as we added a net total of three new communities (369 units) during the year. Occupancy for comparable communities increased by nearly 2 percent to 85.3 percent in 2001. The division reported an after tax loss of $45 million, reflecting pretax restructuring and other charges of $62 million, primarily related to the $60 million write-down of 25 senior living communities held for sale to their estimated fair value and the write-off of a $2 million (pretax) receivable no longer deemed collectible. These charges were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in comparable occupancy and the new units. Distribution Services 2002 Compared to 2001 In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of the distribution services business and decided to exit the business. As of January 3, 2003, through a combination of sale and transfer of nine facilities and the termination of all operations at four facilities, we have exited the distribution services business. Accordingly, we present the operating results of our distribution services business as discontinued operations and classify the remaining assets as held for sale at January 3, 2003 on the balance sheet. The after tax cost to exit the business was $40 million and included payments to third parties in connection with contractual agreements, severance costs and adjusting fixed assets to net realizable value. We present the exit costs together with the loss on operations of $14 million, net of taxes in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. The $14 million after tax loss in 2002 represents a decline of $10 million from 2001 results. The decrease reflects the impact of lower sales and a pretax $2 million write-off in the first quarter of 2002 of an investment in a customer contract, offset by the 2001 restructuring and other charges of $5 million (pretax) for severance costs and the write-off of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy. 2001 Compared to 2000 Financial results for Marriott Distribution Services (MDS) reflect the impact of an increase in sales related to the commencement of new contracts in 2001 and increased sales from contracts established in 2000. The impact of higher sales on the financial results was more than offset by the decline in business from one significant customer, transportation inefficiencies and restructuring and other charges of $5 million (pretax), including severance costs and the write-off of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2001. 20 2001 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In 2001, we responded by implementing certain companywide cost-saving measures, although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $62 million, including (1) $15 million in severance costs; (2) $19 million, primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $28 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We also incurred $142 million of other charges including (1) $85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses; (2) $12 million related to accounts receivable reserves; (3) $13 million related to the write-down of properties held for sale; and (4) $32 million related to the impairment of technology related investments and other write-offs. We have provided below detailed information related to the restructuring costs and other charges, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the economic downturn and the unfavorable lodging environment. 2001 Restructuring Costs Severance Our restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 1,700 employees across our operations (the majority of which were terminated by December 28, 2001). In 2001, we recorded a workforce reduction charge of $15 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits. The charge did not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. In addition, we delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of the workforce reduction and delay in filling vacant positions, we consolidated excess corporate facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $14 million for excess corporate facilities, primarily related to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In addition, we recorded a $5 million charge for lease terminations resulting from cancellations of leased units by our corporate apartment business, primarily in downtown New York City. Development Cancellations and Elimination of Product Line We incur certain costs associated with the development of properties, including legal costs, the cost of land and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, we decided to cancel development projects that were no longer deemed viable. As a result, in 2001, we expensed $28 million of previously capitalized costs. 2001 Other Charges Reserves for Guarantees and Loan Losses We issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the downturn in the economy, certain hotels experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners were not able to meet debt service obligations to the Company or in some cases, to other third-party lending institutions. As a result, in 2001, based upon cash flow projections, we expected to fund under certain guarantees, which were not deemed recoverable, and we expected that several of the loans made by us would not be repaid according to their original terms. Due to these expected non-recoverable guarantee fundings and expected loan losses, we recorded charges of $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. 21 Accounts Receivable-Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2001, we reserved $12 million of accounts receivable which we deemed uncollectible following an analysis of these accounts, generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment. Asset Impairments We recorded a charge related to the impairment of an investment in a technology-related joint venture ($22 million), losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties ($13 million), write-offs of investments in management contracts and other assets ($8 million), and the write-off of capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform ($2 million). The following table summarizes our remaining restructuring liability ($ in millions): Restructuring costs and other charges liability at December 28, 2001 Cash payments made in fiscal 2002 Charges reversed in fiscal 2002 Restructuring costs and other charges liability at January 3, 2003 Severance $ 6 $ 4 $ — $ 2 Facilities exit costs 17 4 2 11 Total restructuring costs 23 8 2 13 Reserves for guarantees and loan losses 33 10 2 21 Impairment of technology-related investments and other 1 1 — — Total $ 57 $ 19 $ 4 $ 34 The remaining liability related to the workforce reduction and fundings under guarantees will be substantially paid by January 2004. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012.

The restructuring liability related to discontinued operations was $3 million as of December 28, 2001 and $1 million as of January 3, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have credit facilities which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At January 3, 2003, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to nearly $2 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements, including the repayment of $200 million of senior notes due in November 2003. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper, and may have to rely more on bank borrowings which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. We have presented a claim with an insurance company for lost management fees from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. At this stage of the claims process, we have recognized $1 million in income from insurance proceeds. Although we expect to realize further proceeds we cannot currently estimate the amounts that may be paid to us. Cash from Operations Cash from operations was $516 million in 2002, $403 million in 2001, and $856 million in 2000. Income from continuing operations is stated after depreciation expense of $114 million in 2002, $110 million in 2001, and $94 million in 2000, and after amortization expense of $36 million in 2002, $68 million in 2001, and $67 million in 2000. While our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts, and cash received from purchaser financing affect annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. In 2002, the $63 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included $102 million in timeshare development (the amount spent to build timeshare resorts less the costs of sales), $280 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $60 million of note sale gains, a $16 million net reduction in Marriott Rewards accruals, $13 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales, and $10 million of other cash outflows, offset by $387 million of note sale proceeds and $31 million of net fees received for servicing notes. In 2001, the $358 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included $253 million in timeshare development, $320 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $40 million of note sale gains and $27 million in capitalized marketing costs, offset by $199 million of note sale proceeds, $26 million of net fees received for servicing notes, $53 million of closed sales in excess of financially reportable sales and $4 million of other cash inflows. In 2000, the $195 million cash outflow from timeshare activity included $112 million in timeshare development, $210 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $23 million of note sale gains, $25 million in capitalized marketing costs, $18 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales and $3 million of other cash outflows, offset by $154 million of note sale proceeds, $17 million of net fees received for servicing notes and $25 million net increase in Marriott Rewards accruals. 23 In 2002, other cash flows from operating activities of $223 million included an adjustment for $186 million related to the exit of our Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses, and an adjustment for $50 million related to the impairment of goodwill of our ExecuStay brand. In 2001, other cash flows from operating activities of $278 million included an adjustment for $248 million, related to non-cash restructuring and other charges, necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operations. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (from continuing operations) was $707 million in 2002, $708 million in 2001, and $1,032 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business, EBITDA would have increased by $125 million, or 18 percent to $833 million. The reconciliation of income from continuing operations, before income taxes to EBITDA is as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Income from continuing operations, before taxes $ 471 $ 421 $ 771 Interest expense 86 109 100 Depreciation 114 110 94 Amortization 36 68 67 EBITDA from continuing operations $ 707 $ 708 $ 1,032 Synthetic Fuel loss, before taxes 134 — — Depreciation-Synthetic Fuel (8 ) — — EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding Synthetic Fuel $ 833 $ 708 $ 1,032 We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. Nevertheless, you should not consider EBITDA an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A substantial portion of our EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With almost 2,600 hotels in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.8 to 1 at January 3, 2003, compared to 1.4 to 1 at December 28, 2001. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. Additionally, we have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreements. In 2002 we securitized $387 million of notes by selling notes receivable originated by our timeshare business. We recognized gains on these sales of $60 million in the year ended January 3, 2003. Our ability to continue to sell notes to such off-balance sheet entities depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the entities buying the notes. Also, our ability to continue to consummate such securitizations would be impacted if the underlying quality of the notes receivable originated by us were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these securitization transactions, at January 3, 2003, we had repurchase obligations of $12 million related to previously sold notes receivable, although we expect to incur no material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the securitizations which are accounted for as interest only strips, and in the year ended January 3, 2003, we received cash flows of $28 million arising from those retained interests. At January 3, 2003, the qualifying special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $682 million. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. 24 Dispositions. Property sales generated proceeds of $729 million in 2002, $554 million in 2001 and $742 million in 2000. Proceeds in 2002 are net of $36 million of financing and joint venture investments made by us in connection with the sales transactions. In 2002 we closed on the sales of 10 hotels and 41 senior living communities, over half of which we continue to operate under long-term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $292 million in 2002, $560 million in 2001, and $1,095 million in 2000 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long-term agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry, and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans, minority equity investments and development of new timeshare resorts. In 2002, other investing activities outflows of $7 million included equity investments of $26 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $11 million and other net cash outflows of $33 million, offset by cash proceeds of $63 million from the sale of our investment in Interval International. In 2001, other investing outflows of $179 million included equity investments of $33 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $97 million and other net cash outflows of $131 million, partially offset by the sale of the affordable housing tax credit investments of $82 million. In 2000, other investing outflows of $377 million included equity investments of $170 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $14 million and other net cash outflows of $193 million. On February 23, 2000, we entered into an agreement to resolve litigation involving certain limited partnerships formed in the mid- to late 1980s. Under the agreement, we paid $31 million to partners in four limited partnerships and acquired, through an unconsolidated joint venture (the Courtyard Joint Venture) with affiliates of Host Marriott Corporation (Host Marriott), substantially all of the limited partners’ interests in two other limited partnerships, Courtyard by Marriott Limited Partnership (CBM I) and Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership (CBM II). These partnerships own 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. The Courtyard Joint Venture was financed with equity contributed in equal shares by us and affiliates of Host Marriott and approximately $200 million in mezzanine debt provided by us. Our total investment in the joint venture, including mezzanine debt, is approximately $300 million. In early 2000, the Company estimated the amount of the planned investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture based upon (1) estimated post acquisition cash flows, including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements to be made contemporaneously with the investment; (2) the investee’s new capital structure; and (3) estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates reflected in the market at that time. The investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000. For purposes of purchase accounting, the Courtyard Joint Venture valued its investment in the partnership units based on (1) pre-acquisition cash flows; (2) the pre-acquisition capital structure; and (3) prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates in December 2000. Due to a number of factors, the equity values used in the purchase accounting for the Courtyard Joint Venture’s investment were different than limited partner unit estimates included in the CBM I and CBM II Purchase Offer and Consent Solicitations (the Solicitations). At a 20 percent discount rate, the combined CBM I and CBM II estimates reflected in the Solicitations totaled $254 million. In the purchase accounting, the corresponding equity value in the Courtyard Joint Venture totaled $372 million. The principal differences between these two amounts are attributed to the following: (1) the investment was consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were prepared ($30 million); and (2) a lower discount rate (17 percent) and capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions versus the date at which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared ($79 million). The Company assessed its potential investment and any potential loss on settlement based on post-acquisition cash flows. The purchase accounting was based on pre-acquisition cash flows and capital structure. As a result, the factors giving rise to the differences outlined above did not materially impact the Company’s previous assessment of any expense related to litigation. The post-settlement equity of the Joint Venture is considerably lower then the pre-acquisition equity due to additional indebtedness post-acquisition and the impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the transaction. 25 Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging businesses because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel sales values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels and senior living communities that we operate or franchise. Loans outstanding under this program, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $944 million at January 3, 2003, $860 million at December 28, 2001 and $592 million at December 29, 2000. Unfunded commitments aggregating $217 million were outstanding at January 3, 2003, of which we expect to fund $140 million in 2003 and $156 million in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third-party ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise. Cash from Financing Activities Debt, including convertible debt, decreased $945 million in 2002 due to the redemption of 85 percent of the LYONs in May 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility, offset by the debt assumed as part of the acquisition of the 14 senior living communities in December 2002. Debt increased by $799 million in 2001 primarily due to borrowings to finance our capital expenditure and share repurchase programs, and to maintain excess cash reserves totaling $645 million in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2002, our long-term debt, excluding convertible debt and debt associated with businesses held for sale, had an average interest rate of 6.8 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.6 years. The ratio of fixed rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was .91 as of January 3, 2003. In April 1999, January 2000 and January 2001, we filed “universal shelf” registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the amounts of $500 million, $300 million and $300 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2003, we had offered and sold to the public under these registration statements $300 million of debt securities at 77/8 percent, due 2009 and $300 million at 81/8 percent, due 2005, leaving a balance of $500 million available for future offerings. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008, and received net proceeds of $297 million. We completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on January 15, 2002. We are a party to revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of $1.5 billion expiring in July 2006, and $500 million expiring in February 2004, which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At January 3, 2003, loans of approximately $21 million were outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. On May 8, 2001, we issued zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. On May 9, 2002, we redeemed for cash the approximately 85 percent of the LYONs that were tendered for mandatory repurchase by the holders. The remaining LYONs are convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. We may not redeem the LYONs prior to May 2004. We may at the option of the holders be required to purchase LYONs at their accreted value on May 8 of each of 2004, 2011 and 2016. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and/or shares of our Class A Common Stock. We determine our debt capacity based on the amount and variability of our cash flows. EBITDA (from continuing operations) coverage of gross interest cost was 5.5 times in 2002, and we met the cash flow requirements under our loan agreements. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business, EBITDA coverage of gross interest would have been 6.5 times. At January 3, 2003, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s, respectively. 26 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Debt $ 1,734 $ 242 $ 550 $ 121 $ 821 Operating Leases Recourse 971 107 174 121 569 Non-recourse 548 17 69 96 366 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 3,253 $ 366 $ 793 $ 338 $ 1,756 The totals above exclude recourse minimum lease payments of $341 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living and Distribution Services businesses, due as follows: less than 1 year $40 million; 1-3 years $68 million; 4-5 years $63 million; and after 5 years $170 million. Also excluded are non-recourse minimum lease payments of $82 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living Services business, due as follows: less than 1 year $2 million; 1-3 years $12 million; 4-5 years $13 million; and after 5 years $55 million. Excluded from the debt obligation is $155 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living Services business. The following table summarizes our commitments: Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 827 $ 77 $ 100 $ 264 $ 386 Timeshare note repurchase obligations 12 — 2 — 10 Total $ 839 $ 77 $ 102 $ 264 $ 396 Our guarantees include $270 million for commitments which will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $217 million at January 3, 2003. We expect to fund $140 million within one year and $16 million in one to three years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $61 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $51 million within one year; $5 million in one to three years; $2 million in four to five years; and $3 million after five years. Share Repurchases. We purchased 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share and 6.1 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of $38.20 per share. As of February 6, 2003, we had been authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase 20 million shares. Dividends. In May 2002, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8 percent to $.07 per share. Other Matters Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years, and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies are in compliance with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. 27 Incentive Fees We recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full-year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fee revenue of $162 million, $202 million and $316 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cost Reimbursements For domestic properties that we manage, we are responsible to employees for salaries and wages and to subcontractors and other creditors for materials and services. We also have the discretionary responsibility to procure and manage the resources in performing our services under these contracts. We therefore include these costs and the reimbursement of the costs as part of our expenses and revenues. We recorded cost reimbursements (excluding senior living services) of $5.7 billion in 2002 and $5.2 billion in 2001 and $5.3 billion in 2000. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $51 million in 2002, $16 million in 2001 and $18 million in 2000. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, the period of cancellation with refund has expired, receivables are deemed collectible and certain minimum sales and construction levels have been attained. For sales that do not meet these criteria, we defer all revenue using the deposit method. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the sales are recognized. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects”. Selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were approximately $107 million and $126 million at January 3, 2003, and December 28, 2001, respectively, and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is canceled, unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs are charged to expense and deposits forfeited are recorded as income. Interest Only Strips We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare business in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and interests in the assets transferred to special purpose entities that are accounted for as interest only strips. The interest only strips are treated as “Trading” or “Available for Sale” securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”. We report changes in the fair values of the interest only strips through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available-for-sale securities. We had interest only strips of $135 million at January 3, 2003 and $87 million at December 28, 2001, which are recorded as long-term receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific 28 impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At January 3, 2003, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $129 million. We have a $59 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $70 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, and communicating with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Avendra In January 2001, Marriott and Hyatt Corporation formed a joint venture, Avendra LLC (Avendra), to be an independent professional procurement services company serving the North American hospitality market and related industries. Six Continents Hotels, Inc., ClubCorp USA Inc., and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, Inc., joined Avendra in March 2001. We and the other four members contributed our respective procurement businesses to Avendra. Currently, our interest in Avendra is slightly less than 50 percent. Avendra generally does not purchase and resell goods and services; instead, its customers purchase goods and services directly from Avendra’s vendors on terms negotiated by Avendra. Avendra earns revenue through agreements with its vendors which provide that the vendors pay Avendra an unrestricted allowance for purchases by its customers. Our hotel management agreements treat vendor-generated unrestricted allowances in three separate ways, and the requirements of those agreements are reflected in our Procurement Services Agreement with Avendra (PSA). For purchases of goods and services by the majority of Marriott’s managed hotels, Avendra is permitted to retain unrestricted allowances, in an amount sufficient only to recover Avendra’s properly allocated costs of providing procurement services. Other management contracts allow Avendra to retain vendor allowances and earn a return which is competitive in the industry. This amount is capped by the PSA. Lastly, for purchases of goods and services by hotels owned by one of Marriott’s hotel owners, Avendra is not permitted to retain any of such unrestricted allowances; instead, Avendra charges a negotiated fee to Marriott, and Marriott in turn charges a negotiated fee to that owner. In 2002, we distributed to the hotels that we manage approximately $12 million in unrestricted rebates received from Avendra, and its predecessor, Marketplace by Marriott. If Marriott franchised hotels (not managed by Marriott) elect to purchase through Avendra, they negotiate separately with Avendra and are not bound by the terms of the PSA for our managed hotels. We account for our interest in Avendra under the equity method and recognized income of $2 million in 2002 and a loss of $1 million in 2001. After we have recovered our investment in Avendra and associated expenses through distributions from Avendra or a sale of all or any portion of our equity interest in Avendra, we will apply any further benefits to offset costs otherwise allocable to Marriott branded hotels. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives and through development and application of credit granting policies. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from December 28, 2001. Furthermore, we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how such exposure is managed in the near future. The following sensitivity analysis displays how changes in interest rates affect our earnings and the fair values of certain instruments we hold. We hold notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates. Hypothetically, an immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest income by $5 million and $5 million, based on the respective balances of these notes receivable at January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt and long-term fixed rate notes receivable. Based on the balances outstanding at January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001, a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt by $42 million and $53 million, respectively, and would change the fair value of long-term fixed rate notes receivable by $20 million and $22 million, respectively, in each year. Although commercial paper is classified as long-term debt (based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis) all commercial paper matures within two months of year-end. Based on the balance of commercial paper outstanding at January 3, 2003, a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would change interest expense by $1 million on an annualized basis. 30",2023-12-30 21:05:46.923630
1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,718 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full-Service Lodging, Select-Service Lodging, Extended-Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 14 separate brand names in 68 countries. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our Synthetic Fuel joint venture. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. This historically challenging time in the lodging industry has demonstrated Marriott International’s resilience, the strength of our business model, superior brands, strong management team and dedicated associates. We are optimistic about a stronger business climate in 2004. And with the final disposition of our senior living and distribution services businesses in 2003, we look forward to operating as a focused lodging and timeshare company for the first time in our 76-year history. In 2003, we grew productivity at the hotel level leveraging our buying power and systems. Greater integration of sophisticated scheduling systems reduced hours worked per occupied room by over 10 percent in 2003 over 2000 levels for participating hotels. In addition, food and supply costs were reduced due to greater participation in our centralized procurement and accounts payable systems. By pooling risk among our managed hotel portfolio, we continued to purchase insurance at a lower cost than any property could purchase alone. By the end of 2003, we had high-speed internet access available in approximately 1,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition. We also introduced wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in over 900 hotels in the U.S. during the year. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. Continuing Operations Revenues ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full-Service $ 5,876 $ 5,508 $ 5,260 Select-Service 1,000 967 864 Extended-Stay 557 600 635 Timeshare 1,279 1,147 1,009 Total lodging 8,712 8,222 7,768 Synthetic fuel 302 193 — $ 9,014 $ 8,415 $ 7,768 19 Income from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full-Service $ 407 $ 397 $ 294 Select-Service 99 130 145 Extended-Stay 47 (3 ) 55 Timeshare 149 183 147 Total lodging financial results (pretax) 702 707 641 Synthetic fuel (after tax) 96 74 — Unallocated corporate expenses (132 ) (126 ) (157 ) Interest income, provision for loan losses and interest expense 12 24 (63 ) Income taxes (excluding Synthetic fuel) (202 ) (240 ) (152 ) $ 476 $ 439 $ 269 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenues from continuing operations increased 7 percent to $9 billion in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic Fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million, to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pretax charge to write-down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. 2002 Compared to 2001 Revenues from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales of our new Synthetic Fuel operation and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by a slowdown in the economy and the resulting decline in lodging demand. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 63 percent to $439 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $74 million associated with our synthetic fuel operation, the results also reflected a $44 million pretax 2002 gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million pretax 2002 charge to write-down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased 2002 demand for hotel rooms and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 include the impact of the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges that we recorded against continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating Income 2003 Compared to 2002 Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write-down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our Synthetic Fuel operation. In 2003, our Synthetic Fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. 2002 Compared to 2001 Operating income decreased 24 percent to $321 million largely as a result of the $50 million write-down of goodwill associated with our ExecuStay business. In addition, we recorded $134 million of operating losses associated with our Synthetic Fuel operation, which commenced operations in 2002. The comparisons to 2001 are impacted by the $155 million restructuring and other charges recorded against operating income in 2001 and a $40 million reduction in incentive fees resulting from the decline in hotel demand. 20 Marriott Lodging We consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. 2003 Compared to 2002 Lodging, which includes our Full-Service, Select-Service, Extended-Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported financial results of $702 million in 2003, compared to $707 million in 2002 and revenues of $8,712 million in 2003, a 6 percent increase, compared to revenues of $8,222 million in 2002. The lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the New York World Trade Center hotel. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $388 million, an increase of 2 percent, reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 1.9 percent decline in REVPAR for our North American managed hotels. Incentive management fees were $109 million, a decline of 33 percent, reflecting the decline in REVPAR as well as lower property level house profit. House profit margins declined 2.7 percentage points, largely due to lower average room rates, higher wages, insurance and utility costs, and lower telephone profits, offset by continued productivity improvements. Franchise fees totaled $245 million, an increase of 6 percent. The comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the $50 million pretax write-down of ExecuStay goodwill recorded in 2002, partially offset by a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International. 2002 Compared to 2001 Lodging financial results increased 10 percent to $707 million, and revenues increased 6 percent to $8,222 million. Results reflected a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, a timeshare exchange company, and increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $379 million, an increase of 2 percent. Franchise fees totaled $232 million, an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were $162 million, a decline of 20 percent. The $50 million write-down of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business, ExecuStay, reduced Lodging results in 2002. The 2002 comparisons are also impacted by $115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded against lodging results in 2001. Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 185 properties totaling over 31,000 rooms across its brands in 2003, while 24 hotels (approximately 4,000 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: • We converted 72 properties (10,050 rooms), or 32 percent of our total room additions for the year from other brands. • We opened approximately 35 percent of new rooms outside the United States. • We added 97 properties (11,900 rooms) to our Select-Service and Extended-Stay brands. • We opened six new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Hawaii, Spain, France, London, Florida and South Carolina. At year-end 2003, we had over 300 hotel properties and approximately 50,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development. We expect to open over 175 hotels and timeshare resorts (approximately 25,000 to 30,000 rooms) in 2004. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. REVPAR We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. The following table shows occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our comparable principal established brands. We have not presented statistics for company-operated North American Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites properties here (or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report) because we operate only a small number of properties as both these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands (identified as “nm” in the tables below). Systemwide 21 statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide International statistics by region are based on comparable worldwide units, excluding North America.

The 3 percent increase in results includes the $36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The 2003 results also reflect an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, largely due to the growth in the number of rooms. Across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 88 hotels (18,000 rooms) and deflagged 15 hotels (3,000 rooms). We typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability. As a result, lower revenue and lower property-level margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees. As a result, full-service incentive fees declined $41 million in 2003. REVPAR for Full-Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 1.6 percent to $90.57. Occupancy for these hotels was flat at 67.1 percent, while average room rates declined 1.6 percent to $134.92. REVPAR for our International systemwide hotels declined 1.5 percent. Occupancy declined 1 percentage point, while average room rates remained flat at $112.14. Our international operations increased 9 percent to $102 million, reflecting $21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an $8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in Istanbul, a $7 million charge to write-down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in January 2004, and the impact of the war and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on international travel earlier in the year. 2002 Compared to 2001 Full-Service Lodging had revenues of $5,508 million, a 5 percent increase over prior year, and segment results of $397 million, an increase of 35 percent. The comparison reflects $84 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 results also reflect a $9 million increase in base management fees, largely due to the growth in the number of managed rooms. Franchise fees decreased $6 million primarily as a result of the transfer of the Ramada license agreements to the joint venture formed with Cendant Corporation. In 2001, we had franchise revenue associated with the Ramada license agreements, while in 2002 we had equity in earnings of the joint venture, the impact of the change in the Ramada structure was partially offset by higher franchise fees resulting from the growth in the number of franchised rooms. Across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 60 hotels (15,000 rooms) and deflagged 12 hotels (3,300 rooms). Full-Service incentive fees were down $27 million due to the decline in the number of properties from which we earn incentive fees. REVPAR for Full-Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 4.4 percent. Occupancy for these hotels was up slightly to 67.6 percent, while the average room rates declined 4.6 percent. International lodging reported an increase in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in Asia and the United Kingdom. The favorable comparison also reflects the restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Select-Service Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,000 $ 967 $ 864 3% 12% Segment results $ 99 $ 130 $ 145 -24% -10% 26 2003 Compared to 2002 Select-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands, had revenues of $1 billion, a 3 percent increase over the prior year, and segment results of $99 million compared to $130 million in 2002. The $31 million decrease reflects the impact of a $12 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, partially offset by a $3 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $12 million of higher equity losses primarily from our Courtyard joint venture, formed in 2000, which owns 120 Courtyard hotels. In 2003, across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,000 rooms) and deflagged four hotels (700 rooms). Over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. 2002 Compared to 2001 Select-Service Lodging had revenues of $967 million, a 12 percent increase compared to the prior year, and segment results of $130 million compared to $145 million in 2002. The comparison to 2001 reflects $13 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The $15 million decrease in segment results reflects the impact of an $11 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, offset by a $13 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $8 million of equity losses in 2002 compared to earnings of $5 million in 2001, primarily related to our Courtyard joint ventures. In 2002, across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we added 80 hotels (10,600 rooms) and deflagged 9 hotels (1,100 rooms). Eighty-two percent of the gross room additions were franchised. Extended-Stay Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 557 $ 600 $ 635 -7% -6% Segment results $ 47 $ (3 ) $ 55 nm nm 2003 Compared to 2002 Extended-Stay Lodging, which includes the Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands, had revenues of $557 million, a decrease of 7 percent, and segment results of $47 million compared to an operating loss of $3 million in 2002. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write-down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million and our franchise fees increased $6 million. In 2003 we added 31 hotels (3,800 rooms) across our Extended-Stay Lodging segment. Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged one property (100 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,300 units. 2002 Compared to 2001 Extended-Stay Lodging had revenues of $600 million, a decrease of 6 percent, and an operating loss of $3 million compared to income of $55 million in 2001. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write-down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million, and our franchise fees increased $5 million. The comparisons to 2001 were also impacted by $16 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. In 2002, across our Extended-Stay Lodging segment, we added 44 hotels (5,400 rooms). Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged three properties (300 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,800 units. 27 Timeshare Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,279 $ 1,147 $ 1,009 12% 14% Segment results $ 149 $ 183 $ 147 -19% 24% 2003 Compared to 2002 The results of our Timeshare segment (Marriott Vacation Club International, Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Marriott Grand Residence Club) decreased 19 percent to $149 million, while revenues increased 12 percent. Note sale gains in 2003 were $64 million compared to $60 million in 2002. Contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and South Carolina and soft in Lake Tahoe, Orlando and Williamsburg. The comparison to 2002 reflects the $44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in Interval International. Timeshare revenues of $1,279 million and $1,147 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, includes interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. 2002 Compared to 2001 The financial results of our Timeshare segment increased 24 percent to $183 million, reflecting a 14 percent increase in revenues, note sale gains in 2002 of $60 million compared to $40 million in 2001, and a gain of $44 million related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation on systems for customer support. Contract sales increased 5 percent. Synthetic Fuel In October 2001, we acquired four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”) for $46 million in cash. The synthetic fuel produced at the Facilities through 2007 qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007). We began operating these Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. Operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits, has been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly accretive to our net income. Our synthetic fuel operation generated net income of $96 million and $74 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although the Facilities produce significant losses, these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which reduce our income tax expense. In fiscal year 2003, our synthetic fuel operation reflected sales of $302 million, equity income of $10 million and an operating loss of $104 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $245 million, including tax credits of $211 million, offset by minority interest expense of $55 million. On June 21, 2003, we completed the previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation. We received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and we are receiving additional profits that we expect will continue over the life of the venture based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser. We earned $56 million of such additional profits in 2003. Certain post closing conditions, including our receipt of satisfactory private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, were satisfied during the fourth quarter. Those rulings confirm, among other things, both that the process used by our synthetic fuel operations produces a “qualified fuel” as required by Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code and the validity of the joint venture ownership structure with the 50 percent purchaser. After reviewing the private letter rulings, the purchaser informed us in writing that it would not be exercising a one-time “put option,” which would potentially have allowed it to return its ownership interest to us if satisfactory rulings had not been obtained prior to December 15, 2003. As a result of the put option, we continued to consolidate the synthetic fuel operation through November 6, 2003. Effective November 7, 2003, because the put option was voided, we account for the Synthetic Fuel joint venture using the equity method of accounting. The $24 million of additional profits we received from the joint venture partner beginning November 7, 2003, along with our share of the equity in losses of the synthetic fuel joint venture, are reflected in the income statement under Equity in earnings/(losses) from synthetic fuel. The additional profits earned prior to November 7, 2003, along with the revenue generated from the previously consolidated synthetic fuel joint venture, are included in synthetic fuel revenue in the income statement. We will continue to record the benefit of our share of the tax credits in our financial statements as a reduction of our tax provision. Going forward, we expect net income will continue to benefit from our participation in the joint venture because of the subsequent tax benefits and credits, as well as the earn-out payments from our venture partner; however, the ultimate impact will depend on the production levels of the synthetic fuel operation and is directly tied to the amount of coal produced. 28 General, Administrative and Other Expenses 2003 Compared to 2002 General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001 General, administrative and other expenses decreased $145 million in 2002 to $510 million, primarily reflecting the following: (i) 2002 items, including a $9 million reserve recorded in connection with a lawsuit involving the sale of a hotel previously managed by us, $3 million of higher litigation expenses, and $9 million of lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan; (ii) 2001 items, including $155 million of restructuring costs and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 associated with the downturn in the economy and the impact of the September 11, 2001 attacks, $13 million related to the write-down of two investments in technology partners; $29 million of goodwill amortization expense (in accordance with FAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill in 2002) $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare note sale gains $ 64 $ 60 $ 40 Gains on sale of real estate 21 28 38 Gains on sales of three international joint ventures 21 — — Gain on sale of investment in Interval International — 44 — $ 106 $ 132 $ 78 Interest Expense 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our timeshare segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid. The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent. 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest expense decreased $23 million to $86 million, reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Interest Income and Income Tax 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million. The provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, compared to $208 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, our pretax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. 29 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest income increased $28 million to $122 million, before reflecting reserves of $12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels. The increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized that were previously deemed uncollectible. The comparison to 2001 also reflects a $6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2002 from 36.1 percent in 2001, primarily due to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $208 million. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 35.4 percent to 15.7 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services In December 2001, management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months. We recorded an impairment charge of $60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value for the year ended December 28, 2001. On October 1, 2002, we completed the sale of these properties for $62 million, which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by $11 million. We included the $11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. In the second quarter of 2002, we sold five senior living communities for $59 million. We ceased operating these communities under our previously existing long-term management agreements. We accounted for these sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66. We continue to provide an operating profit guarantee to the buyer, and fundings under that guarantee are applied against the initial deferred gain of $6 million. As of January 2, 2004, the remaining deferred gain was $3 million. On December 17, 2002, we sold 12 senior living communities to CNL for approximately $89 million. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66, and we recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million. On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc. and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL and a related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise, in March 2003 for $266 million and recognized a gain, net of taxes, of $23 million. On December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities from an unrelated owner for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. Management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. As part of that plan, on March 31, 2003, we acquired all of the subordinated credit-enhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued $46 million of unsecured Marriott International, Inc. notes, due April 2004. In the 2003 third quarter, we sold the 14 communities to CNL for approximately $184 million. We provided a $92 million acquisition loan to CNL in connection with the sale. Sunrise currently operates and will continue to operate the 14 communities under long-term management agreements. We recorded a gain, net of taxes, of $1 million. For the year ended January 3, 2003, we had recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. Accordingly, we report the operating results of our senior living segment in discontinued operations during the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003 and the remaining assets and liabilities were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities of businesses held for sale, respectively, on the balance sheet at January 3, 2003. Distribution Services In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of our Distribution Services business and decided to exit that business. We completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities, closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements. In the year ended January 3, 2003, we recognized a pretax charge of $65 million in connection with the decision to exit this business. The charge includes: (1) $15 million for payments to third parties to subsidize their assumption of, or in some cases to terminate, existing distribution or warehouse lease contracts; (2) $9 million for severance costs; (3) $10 million related to the adjusting of fixed assets to net realizable values; (4) $2 million related to inventory losses; (5) $15 million for losses on equipment leases; (6) $10 million for losses on warehouse leases; and 30 (7) $4 million of other associated charges. For the year ended January 2, 2004, we incurred exit costs, net of tax, of $2 million, primarily related to ongoing compensation costs associated with the wind down. We also reversed $2 million, net of tax, for previously estimated exit costs, which we deemed no longer necessary. 2001 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In 2001, we responded by implementing certain companywide cost-saving measures, although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $62 million, including (1) $15 million in severance costs; (2) $19 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $28 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We also incurred $142 million of other charges including (1) $85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses; (2) $12 million related to accounts receivable reserves; (3) $13 million related to the write-down of properties held for sale; and (4) $32 million related to the impairment of technology-related investments and other write-offs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for aggregate borrowings of up to $2 billion, expiring in 2006 ($1.5 billion expiring in July and $500 million expiring in August), which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. We entered into the $500 million facility during the third quarter of 2003, replacing a similar facility that would have expired in February 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had no loans outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. At January 2, 2004, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately $2.1 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are presented in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash from operations $ 421 $ 516 $ 403 Depreciation expense 132 145 142 Amortization expense 28 42 80 31 While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The net operating activity from our timeshare business (which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business, as that number is a component of income from continuing operations) is shown in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ (94 ) $ (102 ) $ (253 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (284 ) (280 ) (320 ) Note sale gains (64 ) (60 ) (40 ) Financially reportable sales, (in excess of) less than closed sales (4 ) (13 ) 53 Note sale proceeds 281 387 199 Net fees received for servicing notes 17 31 26 Other cash inflows (outflows) 37 (26 ) (23 ) Net cash outflows from timeshare activity $ (111 ) $ (63 ) $ (358 ) In 2002, other cash flows from operating activities of $223 million included an adjustment for $186 million, related to the exit of our Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses, and an adjustment for $50 million, related to the impairment of goodwill of our ExecuStay brand. In 2001, other cash flows from operating activities of $278 million included an adjustment for $248 million, related to non-cash restructuring and other charges. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $745 million in 2003, $551 million in 2002 and $701 million in 2001. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. However, EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is not an alternative to net income, financial results, or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA is as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 502 $ 277 $ 236 Interest expense 110 86 109 Tax (benefit) provision—continuing operations (43 ) 32 152 Tax provision (benefit)—discontinued operations 16 (31 ) (18 ) Depreciation 132 145 142 Amortization 28 42 80 $ 745 $ 551 $ 701 Reducing net income are losses associated with our synthetic fuel operations of $104 million and $134 million, respectively, for the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. Also effecting our 2003 net income is equity in earnings from Synthetic Fuel of $10 million and minority interest expense of $55 million. The Synthetic Fuel operating losses include depreciation expense of $8 million for both the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. There was no loss or depreciation expense associated with our synthetic fuel operations for the year ended December 28, 2001, since operations did not commence until to 2002. Also included in net income above is income from our discontinued senior living services business of $26 million in 2003 and losses of $108 million and $29 million, for 2002 and 2001, respectively, as well as losses from our discontinued distribution services business of $54 million and $4 million, respectively for 2002 and 2001. There were no losses associated with our distribution services business in 2003. Included above is depreciation and amortization expense related to our discontinued operations of $37 million and $44 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. There was no depreciation or amortization expense for our discontinued operations in 2003. A substantial portion of both our net income and therefore EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With over 2,700 hotels in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. 32 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1 at January 2, 2004, compared to 0.8 to 1 at January 3, 2003. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital. In 2003 we sold $281 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare business. We recognized gains on these sales of $64 million in the year ended January 2, 2004. Our ability to continue to sell these timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. Also, we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these timeshare note sales, at January 2, 2004, we had repurchase obligations of $19 million related to notes receivable we have sold. We do not expect to incur material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the notes, which are accounted for as residual interests, and in the year ended January 2, 2004, we received cash flows of $47 million from those retained interests. At January 2, 2004, the special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $733 million. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. Dispositions. Property sales generated cash proceeds of $494 million in 2003, $729 million in 2002 and $554 million in 2001. Proceeds in 2003 are net of a $92 million note receivable and closing costs and other items totaling $25 million. In 2003, we closed on the sales of three hotels and 23 senior living communities. We continue to operate all of the hotels under long-term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $210 million in 2003, $292 million in 2002 and $560 million in 2001 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long-term agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. A summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Equity investments $ (22 ) $ (26 ) $ (33 ) Investment in corporate owned life insurance (12 ) (11 ) (97 ) Other net cash outflows (5 ) (33 ) (131 ) Cash proceeds on sale of investment in Interval International — 63 — Sale of affordable housing tax credit investments — — 82 Other investing outflows $ (39 ) $ (7 ) $ (179 ) Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. We have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business. Loans outstanding, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $996 million at January 2, 2004, $944 million at January 3, 2003, and $860 million at December 28, 2001. Unfunded commitments aggregating $80 million were outstanding at January 2, 2004, of which we expect to fund $44 million in 2004 and $60 million in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third-party ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise. 33 Cash from Financing Activities Debt decreased $319 million in 2003, due to the $200 million repayment, at maturity, of Series A debt in November 2003 and the net pay down of $161 million of commercial paper and other debt. Debt decreased by $945 million in 2002, due to the redemption of 85 percent of the LYONs in May 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility, offset by the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities in December 2002. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2003, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 7.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.8 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.99 as of January 2, 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. We have $500 million available for future offerings under “universal shelf” registration statements we have filed with the SEC. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of $297 million. We completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on January 15, 2002. On May 8, 2001, we issued zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. On May 9, 2002, we redeemed for cash approximately 85 percent of that issue which the LYONs holders tendered for mandatory repurchase. The remaining LYONs are convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. We may redeem the LYONs on or after May 8, 2004. The holders may also at their option require us to purchase the LYONs at their accreted value on May 8 of each of 2004, 2011 and 2016. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and/or shares of our Class A Common Stock. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Debt $ 1,455 $ 64 $ 508 $ 313 $ 570 Capital lease obligations 11 1 2 1 7 Operating leases Recourse 1,163 105 189 196 673 Non-recourse 623 42 94 94 393 Other long-term liabilities 70 9 8 8 45 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,322 $ 221 $ 801 $ 612 $ 1,688 The following table summarizes our commitments as of January 2, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 1,182 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 446 Timeshare note repurchase obligations 19 — — — 19 Total $ 1,201 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 465 34 Our guarantees listed above include $238 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. When we repurchase non- performing timeshare loans, we either collect the outstanding loan balance in full or foreclose on the asset and subsequently resell it. Our guarantees include $387 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre-existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Our guarantees also include $47 million of other guarantees associated with the Sunrise sale transaction. As a result of the settlement with Five Star, discussed in Item 3, $41 million of these guarantees included above expired subsequent to January 2, 2004. Our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $80 million at January 2, 2004. We expect to fund $44 million of those commitments within one year and $16 million in one to three years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $20 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $8 million in one to three years; and $12 million after five years. As part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 35 Related Party Transactions We have equity method investments in entities that own hotels for which we provide management and/or franchise services and we receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Base management fees $ 56 $ 48 $ 48 Incentive management fees 4 4 4 Cost reimbursements 699 557 559 Other income 28 26 28 Total Revenue $ 787 $ 635 $ 639 General, administrative and other $ (11 ) $ (11 ) $ (15 ) Reimbursed costs (699 ) (557 ) (559 ) Interest income 77 66 51 Provision for loan losses (2 ) (5 ) — Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Due to equity method investees $ (2 ) $ (1 ) Due from equity method investees 623 532 Share Repurchases.

As of January 2, 2004, 13 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In May 2003, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 7 percent to $0.075 per share. Other Matters Inflation. Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies. Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Incentive Fees We recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full-year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fee revenue of $109 million, $162 million and $202 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cost Reimbursements We incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 01-14, “Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ‘Out-of-Pocket’ Expenses Incurred,” we report cost reimbursements from managed properties and franchisees as revenue, and we report the costs incurred on behalf of managed properties and franchisees as expenses. Cost 36 reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin or mark-up. These reimbursed costs relate primarily to payroll costs at domestic properties that we manage, but also include costs associated with certain materials and services. Our financial statements reflect cost reimbursements of $6.2 billion in 2003, $5.7 billion in 2002, and $5.2 billion in 2001. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $4 million in 2003, $51 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when (1) we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, (2) the purchaser’s period to cancel for a refund has expired, (3) we deem the receivables to be collectible, and (4) we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects that are attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until we have recognized the sale. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects.” Under this approach, we capitalized selling and marketing costs of approximately $69 million and $107 million at January 2, 2004, and January 3, 2003, respectively, and have included those costs in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is cancelled, we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record forfeited deposits as income. Residual Interests We periodically sell the notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests. The residual interests are treated as “trading” or “available for sale” securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available-for-sale securities. We had residual interests of $203 million at January 2, 2004 and $135 million at January 3, 2003, which are recorded as long-term receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At January 2, 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $142 million. We have a $61 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, 37 including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, and communicating with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections. We evaluate the potential impairment of other intangible assets whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. Our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections. We record an impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 38 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate timeshare and notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals, and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At January 2, 2004, we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. We are required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $726 million, and they expire through 2022. • Twenty-four forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during fiscal year 2004. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is approximately $37 million, and the forward contracts expire throughout 2004. • Two forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets denominated in Pounds Sterling. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $34 million at January 2, 2004. 39 The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of January 2, 2004: Maturities by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 There -after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets - Maturities represent principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,632 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full-Service Lodging, Select-Service Lodging, Extended-Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel joint ventures. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. Lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2004, while demand growth was high. In the United States, demand was strong in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand associated with business travel improved steadily in 2004, and leisure demand remained high. The weak U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies, particularly the euro, resulted in increased travel into the U.S. as overseas trips for many international travelers were less expensive. Conversely, many U.S. vacationers who might have traveled abroad, traveled domestically instead, as the weak dollar made overseas trips more costly. Outside of the U.S. we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. While demand in Latin America and the Caribbean was also good, Europe remains a challenge, as some economies have been slow to rebound. We focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy.” Our Look No Further Best Rate Guarantee, strong Marriott Rewards loyalty program, and information-rich, easy to use web site encourage customers to make reservations through Marriott.com. We have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online agents on an as needed basis. The shift of hotel bookings to our web site from other online channels results in higher revenue, margins and profitability. By the end of 2004, we had high-speed internet access available in over 2,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition, and we had wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in more than 1,900 hotels. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, January 2, 2004 (which we refer to as “2003”), and January 3, 2003 (which we refer to as “2002”). Continuing Operations Revenues 2004 Compared to 2003 Revenues increased 12 percent to $10,099 million in 2004, primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion, as well as strong sales in our Timeshare segment. 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenues increased 7 percent to $9,014 million in 2003, reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Operating Income 2004 Compared to 2003 Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger REVPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the 20 Table of Contents growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in both our lodging ($55 million) and timeshare businesses ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to the Company’s unit growth and increased development costs primarily associated with our Timeshare segment, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. 2003 Compared to 2002 Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our synthetic fuel operation. In 2003, the synthetic fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, January 2, 2004, and January 3, 2003. ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Timeshare note sale gains $ 64 $ 64 $ 60 Synthetic fuel earn-out payments received, net 28 — — Gains on sales of real estate 44 21 28 Gains on sales of joint venture investments 19 21 44 Other 9 — — $ 164 $ 106 $ 132 Interest Expense 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest expense decreased $11 million to $99 million, reflecting the repayment of $234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions, partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million, reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid. The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased $17 million (13 percent) to $146 million, reflecting higher loan balances, including the $200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by Cendant Corporation of our interest in the Two Flags joint venture and higher interest rates. We recognized $9 million of interest income associated with the $200 million note, which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter. Our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of $8 million and includes $3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels, offset by the reversal of $11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes generated a tax provision of $100 million in 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $165 million in 2004, compared to $245 million in 2003 and to higher pre-tax income. In the third quarter of 2003, we sold a 50 percent interest in our synthetic fuel joint ventures, and we currently consolidate the joint ventures. 21 Table of Contents 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million. Our provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, compared to $208 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of the synthetic fuel operation, our pre-tax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. Minority Interest Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures. Due to the purchaser’s put option, which expired on November 6, 2003, minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and their share of the associated tax benefit, along with their share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put option’s expiration date, when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004, (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year-end. For additional information, see the discussion relating to our “Synthetic Fuel” segment on page 31. Income from Continuing Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Income from continuing operations increased 25 percent to $594 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 percent to $2.47. The favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand, new unit growth, strong timeshare results, higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates, lower interest expense due to debt reductions, lower loan loss provisions, stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of $58 million, partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact, and higher general and administrative expenses. 2003 Compared to 2002 Income from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pre-tax charge to write down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. Marriott Lodging We consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies.

The results reflect an 18 percent increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $742 million in 2003 to $873 million in 2004, favorable timeshare results and increased gains and joint venture results of $36 million. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher REVPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international occupancy and average daily rate increases and new unit growth. Systemwide REVPAR for comparable North American properties increased 8.5 percent, and REVPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased 8.6 percent. Systemwide REVPAR for comparable international properties, including The Ritz-Carlton, increased 14.2 percent, and REVPAR for comparable international company-operated properties, including The Ritz-Carlton, increased 16.6 percent. The increase in incentive management fees during the year primarily reflects the impact of increased international demand, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, and increased business at properties throughout North America. We have added 166 properties (27,038 rooms) and deflagged 42 properties (7,335 rooms) since year-end 2003. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inns. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand. Worldwide REVPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased 10.5 percent, while worldwide REVPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.6 percent. 2003 Compared to 2002 Lodging, which includes our Full-Service, Select-Service, Extended-Stay and Timeshare segments, reported financial results of $702 million in 2003, compared to $707 million in 2002, and revenues of $8,712 million in 2003, a 6 percent increase, compared to revenues of $8,222 million in 2002. The 2003 lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the New York World Trade Center hotel. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $388 million, an increase of 2 percent, reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 1.9 percent decline in REVPAR for our North American managed hotels. Incentive management fees were $109 million, a decline of 33 percent, reflecting lower property-level house profit. House profit margins declined 2.7 percentage points, largely due to lower average room rates, higher wages, insurance and utility costs, and lower telephone profits, offset by continued productivity improvements. Franchise fees totaled $245 million, an increase of 6 percent. The comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the $50 million pre-tax write down of ExecuStay goodwill recorded in 2002, partially offset by a $44 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International. Lodging Development We opened 144 properties totaling 24,380 rooms, excluding Ramada International, across our brands in 2004, and 42 properties (7,335 rooms) were deflagged and exited the system. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand in 2004. Highlights of the year included: • We converted 64 properties (10,565 rooms), or 39 percent of our total room additions for the year, from other brands. • We opened over 30 percent of new rooms outside the United States. • We added 109 properties (12,859 rooms) to our Select-Service and Extended-Stay brands. 23 Table of Contents • We opened our first Bulgari Hotel & Resort in Milan, Italy, in May 2004. The second property is expected to open in Bali in 2005. • We opened three new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Aruba; Phoenix, Arizona; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We currently have more than 55,000 rooms in our development pipeline and expect to add 25,000 to 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2005. We expect to deflag approximately 4,000 rooms during 2005. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. REVPAR We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. The following table shows occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our comparable principal established brands. We have not presented statistics for company-operated North American Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites properties here (or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report) because we operate only a limited number of properties, as both of these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands (identified as “nm” in the tables below). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. For North American properties (except for The Ritz-Carlton, which includes January through December), the occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR statistics used throughout this report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, include the period from January 3, 2004, through December 31, 2004, while the statistics for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2004, include the period from January 4, 2003, through January 2, 2004. 24 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties 2004 Change vs. 2003 2004 Change vs. 2003 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (1) Occupancy 72.0 % 2.8 %pts. 70.1 % 2.8 %pts.

The 2004 segment results reflect an $85 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, partially offset by $46 million of increased administrative costs, including costs related to unit growth and development, and the receipt in 2003 of $36 million of insurance proceeds. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger REVPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms. Since year-end 2003, across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we have added 33 hotels (10,212 rooms), and deflagged six hotels (2,860 rooms) excluding Ramada International. As a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system in 2004. The ongoing impact of this sale is not expected to be material to the Company. Gains were up $7 million, primarily due to the exercise by Cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, which generated a gain of $13 million and a note receivable, which was repaid, generating a gain of $5 million. Joint venture results were up $2 million compared to the prior year. For 2003, our equity earnings included $24 million, attributable to our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a $6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest. The improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004, offsetting the decline attributable to the Two Flags joint venture. REVPAR for Full-Service Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 8.4 percent to $109.62. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 71.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 3.6 percent to $153.66. Demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions, generating a 16.6 percent REVPAR increase for comparable company-operated hotels including The Ritz-Carlton. Occupancy increased 6.6 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $129.35. Financial results increased 37 percent to $140 million, due to stronger demand, particularly in China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Egypt. The European markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound. 2003 Compared to 2002 The 3 percent increase in the Full-Service segment results includes the $36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 2003 results also reflect an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, largely due to the growth in the number of rooms. Across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 88 hotels (18,442 rooms) and deflagged 15 hotels (3,152 rooms). We typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability. As a result, lower revenue and lower property-level margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees. As a result, full-service incentive fees declined $41 million in 2003. REVPAR for Full-Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 1.6 percent to $90.57. Occupancy for these hotels was flat at 67.1 percent, while average daily rates declined 1.6 percent to $134.92. Financial results for our international operations increased 9 percent to $102 million, reflecting $21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an $8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in Istanbul, a $7 million charge to write down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in January 2004, and the impact of the war and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on international travel earlier in the year. REVPAR for our international systemwide hotels declined 2.4 percent. Occupancy declined 1.4 percentage points, while average daily rates remained relatively flat at $117.54. 29 Table of Contents Select-Service Lodging ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 1,118 $ 1,000 $ 967 12 % 3 % Segment results $ 140 $ 99 $ 130 41 % -24 % 2004 Compared to 2003 Select-Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands. The increase in revenues over the prior year reflects stronger REVPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms across our select-service brands. Base management, incentive management and franchise fees increased $31 million, and gains were $19 million higher than the prior year, reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned. Joint venture results increased by $5 million as a result of the strong business environment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of $13 million. Most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our Courtyard joint venture (discussed more fully below in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under the heading “Courtyard Joint Venture”). We expect to enter into a new long-term management agreement with the joint venture in early 2005. As the termination of the existing management agreement is probable, in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contract, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we have added 89 hotels (10,556 rooms) and deflagged 35 hotels (4,395 rooms) since year-end 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002 The $31 million decrease in the Select-Service Lodging segment results reflects the impact of a $9 million reduction in base management, incentive management and franchise fees. The results also include $14 million of higher equity losses, primarily from our Courtyard joint venture, formed in 2000, which owns 120 Courtyard hotels. In 2003, across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,054 rooms) and deflagged four hotels (731 rooms). Over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. Extended-Stay Lodging ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 547 $ 557 $ 600 -2 % -7 % Segment results $ 66 $ 47 $ (3 ) 40 % nm 2004 Compared to 2003 Extended-Stay Lodging includes our Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands. The decline in revenue is primarily attributable to the shift in the ExecuStay business from management to franchising. We entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004, and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004. Our base management fees increased $4 million, and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year, while our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, increased $9 million. The increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in REVPAR. Since year-end 2003, we have added 20 hotels (2,303 rooms) and deflagged one hotel (80 rooms) across our Extended-Stay segment. In addition, gains of $10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by $4 million. ExecuStay experienced improved results compared to the prior year, resulting from increased occupancy, primarily in the New York market, coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business towards franchising. The $2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segment’s hotel brands was more than offset by the $6 million decline in ExecuStay’s general and administrative costs associated with the shift toward franchising. REVPAR for Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 9.1 percent to $68.66. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 72.6 percent from 70.0 percent in 2003, while average daily rates increased 4.4 percent to $94.52. 2003 Compared to 2002 In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge in our Extended-Stay Lodging segment to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million and our franchise fees increased $6 million. In 2003, we added 31 hotels (3,837 rooms) across our Extended-Stay Lodging segment. Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged one property (104 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,300 units. 30 Table of Contents REVPAR for Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels decreased 2.2 percent to $63.64. Occupancy for these hotels decreased to 70.0 percent, while average daily rates decreased 1.1 percent to $90.98. Timeshare ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 1,502 $ 1,279 $ 1,147 17 % 12 % Segment results $ 203 $ 149 $ 183 36 % -19 % 2004 Compared to 2003 Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Marriott Grand Residence Club and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International brands. Timeshare revenues of $1,502 million and $1,279 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively, include interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. Including our three joint ventures, contract sales, which represent sales of timeshare intervals before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, increased 31 percent, primarily due to strong demand in South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, California, St. Thomas and Aruba. The favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval sales and services, higher margins, primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs, and the mix of units sold, partially offset by $24 million of higher administrative expenses. Our note sales gain of $64 million was flat compared to the prior year. In addition, we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a $7 million charge in 2004. Reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion. 2003 Compared to 2002 Our Timeshare segment results decreased 19 percent to $149 million, while revenues increased 12 percent. Note sale gains in 2003 were $64 million compared to $60 million in 2002. Contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and South Carolina and soft in Lake Tahoe, Orlando and Williamsburg. The comparison to 2002 reflects the $44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in Interval International. Timeshare revenues of $1,279 million and $1,147 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, includes interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. Synthetic Fuel For 2004, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $321 million and income from continuing operations of $107 million, comprised of: operating losses of $98 million; and equity losses of $28 million (which included net earn-out payments made of $6 million); entirely offset by net earn-out payments received of $28 million; a $21 million tax benefit; tax credits which amounted to $144 million; and a minority interest benefit of $40 million reflecting our partner’s share of the operating losses. For 2003, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $302 million and income from continuing operations of $96 million, comprised of: operating losses of $104 million (which included net earn-out payments made of $14 million); minority interest expense of $55 million, reflecting our partner’s share of the tax credits, tax benefits, and operating losses; entirely offset by equity income of $10 million; a $34 million tax benefit; and tax credits which amounted to $211 million. The $11 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to the synthetic fuel operation to $107 million from $96 million is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004. In July 2004, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a Summary Report to PacifiCorp, the previous owner of the synthetic fuel facilities, that included a challenge to the placed-in-service dates of three of the four synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of our synthetic fuel joint ventures. One of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code is that the production facility must have been placed-in-service before July 1, 1998. We strongly believe that all the facilities meet the placed-in-service requirement. Although we are engaged in discussions with the IRS and are confident this issue will be resolved in our favor and not result in a material charge to us, we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of this matter. If ultimately resolved against us we could be prevented from realizing projected future tax credits and cause us to reverse previously utilized tax credits, requiring payment of substantial additional taxes. Since acquiring the plants, we have recognized approximately $435 million of tax credits from all four plants through December 31, 2004. The tax credits recognized through December 31, 2004, associated with the three facilities in question totaled approximately $330 million. 31 Table of Contents On October 6, 2004, we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that result in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us. On the synthetic fuel facility that is not being reviewed by the IRS, our partner increased its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through March 31, 2005, and pays a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits. With respect to the three synthetic fuel facilities under IRS review, our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to an average of roughly 5 percent through March 31, 2005. If the IRS’ placed-in-service challenge regarding the three facilities is not successfully resolved by March 31, 2005, our partner will have the right to return its ownership interest in those three facilities to us at that time. We will have the flexibility to continue to operate at current levels, reduce production and/or sell an interest to another party. If there is a successful resolution by March 31, 2005, our partner’s share of the tax credits from all four facilities will return to approximately 50 percent. In any event, on March 31, 2005, our share of the tax credits from the one facility not under review will return to approximately 50 percent. Impact of Future Adoption of Accounting Standards Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-sharing Transactions” In December 2004, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (“SOP”) 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-sharing Transactions,” and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. The SOP will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Under the SOP, the majority of the costs incurred to sell timeshares will be charged to expense when incurred. In regards to notes receivable issued in conjunction with a sale, an estimate of uncollectibility that is expected to occur must be recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that profit is recognized on a timeshare sale. Rental and other operations during holding periods must be accounted for as incidental operations, which require that any excess costs be recorded as a reduction of inventory costs. We estimate that the initial adoption of the SOP, which will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our Fiscal Year 2006 financial statements, will result in a non-cash one-time pre-tax charge of approximately $150 million, consisting primarily of the write-off of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserve on notes. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption will not be significant. FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS No. 123R”), which is a revision of FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” FAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends FAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” We will adopt FAS No. 123R at the beginning of our 2005 third quarter. FAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values. The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using an option-pricing model adjusted for any unique characteristics of a particular instrument. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. We estimate that adoption of FAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective method, will result in incremental pre-tax expense in fiscal year 2005 of approximately $20 million, based on our current share-based payment compensation plans and a mid-year adoption. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We recorded after-tax charges of $131 million in 2002 associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL and a related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise in March 2003 for $266 million. We recorded after-tax gains of $19 million in 2003. 32 Table of Contents Distribution Services In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of our Distribution Services business and decided to exit that business. We completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities, closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements. We recorded after-tax charges of $40 million in 2002 in connection with the decision to exit this business. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of up to $2 billion, expiring in 2006 ($1.5 billion expiring in July and $500 million expiring in August), which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, we had no loans outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on our public debt rating. At December 31, 2004, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately $2.7 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements, including the repayment of our Series D senior notes totaling $275 million and our Series B senior notes totaling $200 million, both of which mature in 2005. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cash from operations $ 891 $ 403 $ 516 Depreciation expense 133 132 145 Amortization expense 33 28 42 While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business (which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business, as that number is a component of income from continuing operations): ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ 93 $ (94 ) $ (102 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (459 ) (247 ) (218 ) Loan repurchases (18 ) (19 ) (16 ) Note sale gains (64 ) (64 ) (60 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 129 (4 ) (13 ) Note sale proceeds 312 231 341 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 94 50 31 Other cash inflows (outflows) 26 36 (26 ) Net cash inflows (outflows) from timeshare activity $ 113 $ (111 ) $ (63 ) Our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. 33 Table of Contents Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.8 to 1 at both December 31, 2004, and January 2, 2004. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $181 million in 2004, $210 million in 2003 and $292 million in 2002 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvement to existing properties and systems initiatives. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $402 million in 2004, $494 million in 2003 and $729 million in 2002. In 2004, we closed on the sales of two hotels, and we continue to operate both of the hotels under long-term management agreements. We also disposed of 30 land parcels, our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, two other minority interests in joint ventures and other miscellaneous assets. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. We have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business. Loan collections, net of advances during 2004, amounted to $147 million. Loans outstanding, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $942 million at December 31, 2004, $996 million at January 2, 2004, and $944 million at January 3, 2003. Unfunded commitments aggregating $42 million were outstanding at December 31, 2004, of which we expect to fund $12 million in 2005 and $26 million in total. Other Investing Activities A summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below. ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Equity investments $ (75 ) $ (22 ) $ (26 ) Investment in corporate-owned life insurance (8 ) (12 ) (11 ) Other net cash inflows (outflows) 2 22 (33 ) Cash proceeds on sale of investment in Interval International — — 63 Other investing outflows $ (81 ) $ (12 ) $ (7 ) Cash from Financing Activities Debt Debt decreased $130 million in 2004, from $1,455 million to $1,325 million, due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zero-coupon convertible senior Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021, also known as LYONs (“the LYONs”) totaling $62 million, the maturity of $46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of $22 million. Debt decreased by $319 million in 2003, due to the $200 million repayment, at maturity, of Series A debt in November 2003 and the net pay down of $161 million of commercial paper and other debt. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2004, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 7.5 percent and an average maturity of approximately 2.5 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was slightly lower than one as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. 34 Table of Contents We have $500 million available for future offerings under “universal shelf” registration statements we have filed with the SEC. Share Repurchases. We purchased 14.0 million of our shares in 2004 at an average price of $46.65 per share, 10.5 million of our shares in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share, and 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share. As of December 31, 2004, 18.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In May 2004, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13 percent to $0.085 per share. Pending Transaction Courtyard Joint Venture In December 2004, we and Host Marriott announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement by which an institutional investor would obtain a 75 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture. We expect the transaction, which is subject to certain closing conditions, to close in early 2005, although we cannot assure you that the sale will be completed. Currently, we and Host Marriott own equal shares in the 120 property joint venture, and with the addition of the new equity, our percentage interest in the joint venture will decline from 50 percent to 21 percent. As a result of the transaction, the pace of the Courtyard hotel reinventions, a program that renovates and upgrades Courtyard hotels, will be accelerated. Upon closing of the transaction: • We expect that our existing mezzanine loan to the joint venture (including accrued interest) totaling approximately $249 million at December 31, 2004, will be repaid; • We expect to make available to the joint venture a seven-year subordinated loan of approximately $144 million to be funded as reinventions are completed in 2005 and 2006; • We expect to enter into a new long-term management agreement with the joint venture. As the termination of the existing management agreement is probable, we have written off our deferred contract costs related to the existing contract in the 2004 fourth quarter, resulting in a charge of $13 million; and • Upon closing of the transaction, we expect to record a gain associated with the repayment of the mezzanine loan, which will be substantially offset by our portion of the joint venture’s costs of prepaying an existing senior loan. On an ongoing basis, we expect our interest income will decline as a result of the repayment of the mezzanine loan, and we expect lower book losses from the joint venture due to the reduction of our equity interest and improved performance at the hotels. On a long-term basis, we expect that the Courtyard reinventions will promote continued growth and maintain and enhance customer preference. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Debt 1 $ 1,723 $ 575 $ 147 $ 702 $ 299 Capital lease obligations 1 16 1 2 2 11 Operating leases Recourse 1,035 93 195 205 542 Non-recourse 544 28 38 31 447 Other long-term liabilities 56 — 6 6 44 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,374 $ 697 $ 388 $ 946 $ 1,343 1 Includes principal as well as interest payments. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our commitments as of December 31, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Total guarantees where Marriott International is the primary obligor $ 601 $ 64 $ 203 $ 121 $ 213 Total guarantees where Marriott International is secondarily liable 1,909 108 209 211 1,381 Total other commercial commitments $ 2,510 $ 172 $ 412 $ 332 $ 1,594 Our guarantees listed above include $91 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees above include $349 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre-existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $63 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately $1.56 billion. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted above, as of December 31, 2004, our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $42 million at December 31, 2004. We expect to fund $12 million of those commitments within one year and $14 million in the following year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $16 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $14 million within one year and $2 million after five years. At December 31, 2004, we also have commitments to invest $37 million of equity for a minority interest in two partnerships, which plan to purchase both full-service and select-service hotels in the United States. At December 31, 2004, we also had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of December 31, 2004, totaled $486 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and self-insurance programs. As part of the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 36 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Base management fees $ 72 $ 56 $ 48 Incentive management fees 8 4 4 Cost reimbursements 802 699 557 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 29 28 26 Total revenue $ 911 $ 787 $ 635 General, administrative and other $ (33 ) $ (11 ) $ (11 ) Reimbursed costs (802 ) (699 ) (557 ) Gains and other income 19 21 44 Interest income 74 77 66 Reversal of (provision for) loan losses 3 (2 ) (5 ) Equity in earnings (losses) – Synthetic fuel (28 ) (10 ) — Equity in earnings (losses) – Other (14 ) (17 ) (6 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2004 2003 Current assets - accounts and notes receivable $ 72 $ 118 Contract acquisition costs 24 42 Equity method investments 249 468 Loans to equity method investees 526 558 Other long-term receivables 3 — Other long-term assets 38 30 Current liabilities: Accounts payable (3 ) (2 ) Other payables and accruals (4 ) (1 ) Other long-term liabilities (11 ) (10 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: • it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and • changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare intervals, and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. 37 Table of Contents Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At December 31, 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $181 million. We have a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $89 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Audit Services Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”), recently notified the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors that certain non-audit services E&Y performed in China and Japan for a large number of public companies, including Marriott, have raised questions regarding E&Y’s independence in its performance of audit services. With respect to Marriott, from 2001 through 2004, E&Y performed tax calculation and preparation services for Marriott employees located in China and Japan, and affiliates of E&Y made payment of the relevant taxes on behalf of Marriott. The payment of those taxes involved handling of Company-related funds, which is not permitted under SEC auditor independence rules. These actions by affiliates of E&Y have been discontinued, and both the amount of the taxes and the fees paid to E&Y in connection with these services are de minimis. The Audit Committee and E&Y discussed E&Y’s independence with respect to the Company in light of the foregoing facts. E&Y informed the Audit Committee that it does not believe that the holding and paying of those funds impaired E&Y’s independence with respect to the Company. The Company, based on its own review, also is 38 Table of Contents not aware of any additional non-audit services that may compromise E&Y’s independence in performing audit services for the Company. Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate timeshare and notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals, and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At December 31, 2004, we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. We are required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $535 million, and they expire through 2022. • Forward foreign exchange and option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during fiscal year 2005. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is approximately $36 million, and they expire throughout 2005. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets denominated in pounds sterling. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $36 million at December 31, 2004. 40 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: ($ in millions) Maturities by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets - Maturities represent principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,741 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: Full-Service Lodging, Select-Service Lodging, Extended-Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 67 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare intervals and personal residences, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Similar to conditions that existed last year, lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2005, while demand growth was high. As a result, both occupancies and average daily rates continued to rise. Transient demand, both business and leisure, was strong in 2005, and we experienced particularly robust pricing power associated with that demand. In addition, our group rates are continuing to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is being replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. In the United States, demand was strongest in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand was also strong in Hawaii. The weak U.S. dollar, in relation to other currencies, helped increase travel, versus the prior year, into the United States. In addition, we saw increased demand associated with U.S. vacationers who were also impacted by the weak U.S. dollar and traveled domestically instead of abroad. Outside of the United States we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in China, Hong Kong, the Middle East, Mexico and the Caribbean. Demand in Europe and South American countries continues to remain less robust, as some economies continue to emerge from a slowdown. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Continuing Operations Revenues 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed properties (see the “CTF Holdings Ltd.” discussion later in this report under the “Acquisitions” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section). 25 Table of Contents The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark-up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms) to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section). 2004 Compared to 2003 Revenues increased 12 percent to $10,099 million in 2004 from $9,014 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion, as well as higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue. Operating Income 2005 Compared to 2004 Operating income increased $78 million to $555 million in 2005 from $477 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the following items: a combined base, incentive and franchise fee improvement of $154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment; $51 million of stronger timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue; and $65 million of stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses. The fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, including the CTF properties, the strong demand environment in 2005, and our receipt in 2005, of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. The favorable items noted above were partially offset by $146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and $46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses. Increased general and administrative expenses were associated with our Lodging segments as unallocated general and administrative expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflects a $94 million pre-tax charge impacting our Full-Service Lodging segment, primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements (discussed more fully later in this report in the “CTF Holdings Ltd.” discussion under the “Investing Activities Cash Flows” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section), and $30 million of pre-tax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, impacting our Full-Service, Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging segments. We implemented the bedding incentive program in 2005 to ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year-end 2005. General and administrative expenses in 2005 also reflect pre-tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties, a $9 million pre-tax charge associated with three guarantees, increased other net overhead costs of $13 million including costs related to the Company’s unit growth, development and systems, and $2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by $5 million of lower litigation expenses. Additionally, in 2004, general and administrative expenses included a $13 million charge associated with the write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs. Operating income for 2005 includes a synthetic fuel operating loss of $144 million versus $98 million of operating losses in the prior year, reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. For additional information, see our “Synthetic Fuel” segment discussion later in this report. 2004 Compared to 2003 Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004 from $377 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger RevPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million from $523 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in our Full-Service, Select-Service, and Extended-Stay segments ($55 million) and Timeshare segment ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to 26 Table of Contents the Company’s unit growth and timeshare development, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. Higher general and administrative expenses of $84 million also reflect a $13 million write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs as further discussed in the “2004 Compared to 2003” caption under the “Select-Service Lodging” heading later in this report. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for 2005, 2004, and 2003. ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Timeshare note sale gains $ 69 $ 64 $ 64 Gains on sales of joint venture investments 7 19 21 Synthetic fuel earn-out payments received, net 32 28 — Gains on sales of real estate and other 34 48 21 Other note sale/repayment gains 25 5 — Income from cost method joint ventures 14 — — $ 181 $ 164 $ 106 Interest Expense 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest expense increased $7 million (7 percent) to $106 million in 2005 from $99 million in the prior year, reflecting increased debt levels which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005. Interest expense in 2005 reflected our June 2005 Series F Senior Notes issuance, and, versus the prior year, higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling $29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows from owners, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates, and Self-Insurance programs. The increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Senior Notes in April 2005 and Series B Senior Notes in November 2005 and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties. 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest expense decreased $11 million to $99 million in 2004 from $110 million in the prior year, reflecting the repayment of $234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions, partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. Included within interest expense for 2004 and 2003 are charges totaling $11 million and $8 million, respectively, associated with programs operated on behalf of owners as described above. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $67 million (46 percent) to $79 million in 2005 from $146 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us. The repayments are described more fully under the “Loan Activity” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. Our provision for loan losses increased $36 million versus the prior year reflecting an $11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a pre-tax charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease, as discussed more fully under the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of $94 million for 2005, compared to a tax provision of $100 million for 2004. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint ventures, which generated a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005, compared to a net tax benefit of $165 million in 2004, and to a lower tax rate before the impact of the Synthetic Fuel segment in 2005, as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates. Higher taxes associated with higher pre-tax income in 2005 partially offset these favorable tax impacts. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 27 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased $17 million (13 percent) to $146 million in 2004 from $129 million in the prior year, reflecting higher loan balances, including the $200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by Cendant Corporation of our interest in the Two Flags joint venture and higher interest rates. We recognized $9 million of interest income associated with the $200 million note, which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter. Our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of $8 million and includes $3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels, offset by the reversal of $11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of $100 million in 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $165 million in 2004, compared to $245 million in 2003 and to higher pre-tax income. For additional information see the analysis of our results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2005 Compared to 2004 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees increased $78 million from a net loss of $42 million in 2004 to net earnings of $36 million in 2005. Twenty-eight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures which we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter, versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. The remaining $50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to significant 2005 asset sale gains in several joint ventures producing higher earnings from joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year. 2004 Compared to 2003 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees decreased to a net loss of $42 million in 2004 from a net loss of $7 million in 2003. In 2003, we recognized equity earnings of $24 million associated with our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while in 2004 we only recognized $6 million of equity earnings due to the redemption of our interest. In addition, we had equity income from our synthetic fuel joint ventures of $10 million in 2003 compared to equity losses of $28 million in 2004. The improved business environment in 2004 and the mix of investments versus the prior year favorably impacted our equity income by $21 million, partially offsetting the aforementioned negative variances. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Minority Interest 2005 Compared to 2004 Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $45 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year-end. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. As further described in the “Synthetic Fuel” caption in Part I, Item 1 “Business.” On the first day of our 2006 fiscal year, we redeemed our partner’s interest in SAFE II. Accordingly, in 2006, minority interest will only represent our partner’s share of the losses in SAFE I. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 2004 Compared to 2003 Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the impact of a change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. Due to the purchaser’s put option, which expired on November 6, 2003, minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit, along with its share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put option’s expiration date, when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year-end. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 28 Table of Contents Income from Continuing Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from continuing operations increased $74 million (12 percent) to $668 million in 2005 versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.42 (17 percent) to $2.89. As discussed above in more detail, the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment, increased owned, leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses (principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter), increased timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, stronger equity income, higher gains and other income, and lower taxes. As discussed above in more detail, increased general and administrative expenses reflecting, among other things, the write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the CTF transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses, lower interest income, higher interest expense, and a higher loan loss provision partially offset these favorable items. 2004 Compared to 2003 Income from continuing operations increased $118 million (25 percent) to $594 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.53 (27 percent) to $2.47. The favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand, new unit growth, strong timeshare results, higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates, lower interest expense due to debt reductions, lower loan loss provisions, stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of $58 million, partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact, and higher general and administrative expenses. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: • Full-Service, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, The Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts; • Select-Service, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites; • Extended-Stay, which includes Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott ExecuStay and Marriott Executive Apartments; • Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and sale of timeshare, fractional, and whole ownership properties under the Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands; and • Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest income, provision for loan losses, and interest expense. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity in earnings (losses) from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Unallocated corporate expenses represent that portion of our general, administrative and other expenses and equity in earnings (losses) that are not allocable to our segments. We have aggregated the brands and businesses presented within each of our segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels and the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment. 29 Table of Contents Revenues ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full-Service $ 7,535 $ 6,611 $ 5,876 Select-Service 1,265 1,118 1,000 Extended-Stay 608 547 557 Timeshare 1,721 1,502 1,279 Total Lodging 11,129 9,778 8,712 Synthetic Fuel 421 321 302 $ 11,550 $ 10,099 $ 9,014 Income from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full-Service $ 474 $ 426 $ 407 Select-Service 209 140 99 Extended-Stay 65 66 47 Timeshare 271 203 149 Total Lodging financial results 1,019 835 702 Synthetic Fuel (after-tax) 125 107 96 Unallocated corporate expenses (137 ) (138 ) (132 ) Interest income, provision for loan losses and interest expense (55 ) 55 12 Income taxes (excluding Synthetic Fuel) (284 ) (265 ) (202 ) $ 668 $ 594 $ 476 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full-Service $ 39 $ 10 $ 8 Select-Service (5 ) (17 ) (22 ) Timeshare 1 (7 ) (4 ) Synthetic Fuel — (28 ) 10 Corporate 1 — 1 $ 36 $ (42 ) $ (7 ) Marriott Lodging Lodging includes our Full-Service, Select-Service, Extended-Stay and Timeshare segments. We consider Lodging revenues and Lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We added 134 properties (21,611 rooms) and deflagged 25 properties (4,755 rooms) in 2005. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inn properties. 30 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Lodging reported financial results of $1,019 million in 2005, compared to $835 million in 2004, and revenues of $11,129 million in 2005, a 14 percent increase from revenues of $9,778 million in 2004. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $154 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $873 million in 2004 to $1,027 million in 2005, stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses, improved equity income and higher gains. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international rate increases and new unit growth. Incentive management fees increased $59 million (42 percent) in 2005 versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased travel worldwide driving strong property level profits. The increase also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. In 2005, 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 32 percent in 2004. Increased general and administrative expenses of $146 million, as discussed in the earlier “Operating Income” discussion, partially offset these improvements. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased 9.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased 9.8 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 11.9 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased 11.0 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased 10.1 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.9 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable managed property-level house profit margins increased 180 basis points. 2004 Compared to 2003 We added 166 properties (27,038 rooms) and deflagged 42 properties (7,335 rooms) from year-end 2003 to year-end 2004. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inn properties. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of the Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand. Lodging reported financial results of $835 million in 2004, compared to $702 million in 2003, and revenues of $9,778 million in 2004, a 12 percent increase from revenues of $8,712 million in 2003. The results reflect a $131 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $742 million in 2003 to $873 million in 2004, favorable Timeshare segment results and increased gains and joint venture results of $36 million. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international occupancy and average daily rate increases and new unit growth. In 2004, 32 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 29 percent in the prior year. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased 8.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased 8.6 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased 14.2 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased 16.6 percent. The increase in incentive management fees during the year primarily reflects the impact of increased international demand, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, and increased business at properties throughout North America. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased 10.5 percent, while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.6 percent. Lodging Development We opened 134 properties totaling 21,611 rooms, across our brands in 2005, and 25 properties (4,755 rooms), predominantly Fairfield Inn properties, were deflagged and exited the system. Highlights of the year included: • We converted 33 properties (5,846 rooms), or 27 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands. • We opened over 20 percent of new rooms outside the United States. • We added 103 properties (12,656 rooms) to our Select-Service and Extended-Stay brands. • We opened two new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Hilton Head, South Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada. 31 Table of Contents We currently have more than 70,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our development pipeline, and we expect to add approximately 25,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2006. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. RevPAR The following tables show, for 2005 and 2004, occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR for each of our comparable North American principal established brands and for our international properties by either region or brand. We have not presented statistics for company-operated North American Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as this brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. For North American properties the occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005 through December 30, 2005, the statistics for 2004 include the period from January 3, 2004 through December 31, 2004, and the statistics for 2003 include the period from January 4, 2003 through January 2, 2004 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton and International properties, which includes the period from January 1 through December 31). 32 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties 2005 Change vs. 2004 2005 Change vs. 2004 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (1) Occupancy 73.2 % 1.0 % pts. 71.0 % 1.2 % pts.

As discussed more fully earlier in this report in Part I, under the Ramada International caption in the Item 1 “Business” section, we sold Ramada International in 2004. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 7,535 $ 6,611 $ 5,876 14% 13% Segment results $ 474 $ 426 $ 407 11% 5% 2005 Compared to 2004 In 2005, across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 30 hotels (8,326 rooms) and deflagged seven hotels (2,446 rooms). Compared to the prior year, our 2005 segment results reflect a $91 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees and $73 million of increased owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, which includes a $10 million termination fee payment to us associated with one property that left our system, partially offset by $6 million of severance payments and other costs associated with the temporary closing of a leased property undergoing renovation. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases which favorably impact property-level house profits, the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, all of which we expect to sell in 2006, including the CTF properties. Further impacting segment results, gains and other income was $5 million higher than the prior year, while equity results increased by $29 million versus the prior year. The increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the following items: $9 million of higher gains in 2005 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties; $11 million of increased income in 2005 associated with cost method investments, partially offset by the $13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the Two Flags Joint Venture. The increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures which had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains, and to a lesser extent, the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments. The increase in income associated with cost method investments is primarily related to one new investment in 2005. RevPAR for Full-Service Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 10.0 percent to $121.27. Occupancy for these hotels increased 1.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 7.8 percent to $166.58. Somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances noted above were $151 million of higher general and administrative costs. As noted in the preceding “Operating Income” discussion, during 2005 we recorded a $94 million pre-tax charge, primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF management agreements, and we incurred pre-tax expenses of $18 million related to our bedding incentive program, both of which impacted our general and administrative expenses. In 2005, we also recorded pre-tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties and $6 million of pre-tax charges associated with two guarantees, which impacted general and administrative expenses. In addition, in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development. Financial results for our international operations were strong across most regions. Increased demand in 2005 generated an 11.0 percent RevPAR increase for comparable company-operated hotels over 2004. Additionally, occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $137.62. In 2005 we experienced strong demand particularly in China, Mexico, the Caribbean and Egypt. The European markets generally continue to remain less robust. 37 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 During 2004, across our Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 33 hotels (10,212 rooms), and deflagged six hotels (2,860 rooms) excluding Ramada International. As a result of the sale of the Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system in 2004. The ongoing impact of this sale has not been material to the Company. The 2004 segment results reflect an $85 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, partially offset by $46 million of increased administrative costs, including costs related to unit growth and development, and the receipt in 2003 of $36 million of insurance proceeds. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms. Gains were up $7 million, primarily due to the exercise by Cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, which generated a gain of $13 million, and a note receivable, which was repaid, generating a gain of $5 million. Joint venture results were up $2 million compared to the prior year. For 2003, our equity earnings included $24 million, attributable to our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a $6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest. The improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004, offsetting the decline attributable to the Two Flags joint venture. RevPAR for Full-Service Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 8.4 percent to $109.62. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 71.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 3.6 percent to $153.66. Demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions, generating a 16.6 percent RevPAR increase for comparable company-operated hotels. Occupancy increased 6.6 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $129.35. Financial results increased 37 percent to $140 million, due to stronger demand, particularly in China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Egypt. The European markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound. Select-Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 1,265 $ 1,118 $ 1,000 13% 12% Segment results $ 209 $ 140 $ 99 49% 41% 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,363 rooms) and deflagged 18 hotels (2,309 rooms) in 2005. The deflagged properties were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our select-service brands. The $69 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $35 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $4 million of higher owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, $12 million of higher gains and other income, a $12 million increase in equity results, and $6 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included $8 million of higher pre-tax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. In 2004, as discussed below, we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs, impacting general and administrative expenses, totaling $13 million. The 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, which generated pre-tax gains of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard joint venture and increased income of $3 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures, partially offset by $20 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales. Stronger performance at our reinvented Courtyard properties, versus non-reinvented properties, is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year. For additional information related to the Courtyard joint venture, see the “Courtyard Joint Venture” caption in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this report. 38 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 Across our Select-Service Lodging segment, we added 89 hotels (10,556 rooms) and deflagged 35 hotels (4,395 rooms) in 2004. The increase in the Select-Service Lodging segment revenues for 2004 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms across our select-service brands. Base management, incentive management and franchise fees increased $31 million, and gains were $19 million higher than the prior year, reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned. Joint venture results increased by $5 million as a result of the strong business environment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of $13 million. Most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our Courtyard joint venture (discussed more fully later in this report in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under the heading “Courtyard Joint Venture”). As the termination of the existing management agreements associated with the Courtyard joint venture was probable in 2004, we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contracts, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Extended-Stay Lodging includes our Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 608 $ 547 $ 557 11% -2% Segment results $ 65 $ 66 $ 47 -2% 40% 2005 Compared to 2004 Across the Extended-Stay Lodging segment, we added 37 hotels (4,293 rooms) in 2005. Our base and incentive management fees in 2005 were $12 million higher than the prior year and our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, also increased $12 million. The increase in management and franchise fees is largely due to higher RevPAR driven by increased demand and to the growth in the number of rooms. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses declined $12 million compared to a year ago primarily as a result of our ExecuStay brand’s shift toward franchising. Gains and other income was $11 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting gains on sales of real estate in 2004 versus no gains in 2005. General and administrative costs were slightly higher, primarily reflecting 2005 pre-tax expenses of $4 million associated with our bedding incentive program and a $6 million charge in 2005 associated with the settlement of litigation, almost entirely offset by lower general, administrative and other expenses, including lower costs associated with ExecuStay’s shift toward franchising. RevPAR for Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 9.4 percent to $76.49. Occupancy for these hotels increased slightly to 73.8 percent from 72.6 percent in 2004, while average daily rates increased 8.7 percent to $103.70. 2004 Compared to 2003 In 2004, we added 20 hotels (2,303 rooms) and deflagged one hotel (80 rooms) across our Extended-Stay Lodging segment. The decline in our Extended-Stay Lodging segment revenue in 2004 is primarily attributable to the shift in the ExecuStay business from management to franchising. We entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004, and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004. Our base management fees increased $4 million, and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year, while our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, increased $9 million. The increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in RevPAR. In addition, gains of $10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by $4 million. ExecuStay experienced improved results compared to the prior year, resulting from increased occupancy, primarily in the New York market, coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business toward franchising. The $2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segment’s hotel brands was more than offset by the $6 million decline in ExecuStay’s general and administrative costs associated with ExecuStay’s shift toward franchising. 39 Table of Contents RevPAR for Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging comparable company-operated North American hotels increased 9.1 percent to $68.66. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 72.6 percent from 70.0 percent in 2003, while average daily rates increased 4.4 percent to $94.52. Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 1,721 $ 1,502 $ 1,279 15% 17% Segment results $ 271 $ 203 $ 149 33% 36% 2005 Compared to 2004 Timeshare revenues of $1,721 million and $1,502 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively, include interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales, base management fees, resort rental fees and cost reimbursements. Timeshare contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, which represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, were flat as compared to last year, reflecting limited available inventory at several projects in 2005 which are approaching sell-out status versus higher contract sales at those projects in the prior year. The favorable segment results compared with 2004 reflect a $51 million increase in timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue under the percentage of completion accounting, a higher development margin, primarily resulting from the mix of units sold, and higher financing income reflecting a higher average notes receivable portfolio balance in 2005. In addition, compared with 2004, base fees increased $4 million, gains increased $6 million, equity earnings increased $8 million, and general and administrative expenses were flat. Improved equity results primarily reflect start-up losses in 2004 versus earnings in 2005 associated with one joint venture, and the increase in gains is attributable to note sales which generated gains of $69 million in 2005 compared to $64 million in 2004. In 2005 we also decided to cease development of one land parcel, and we recorded a $7 million charge in conjunction with the write-off of the previously capitalized costs which impacted our timeshare direct expenses. 2004 Compared to 2003 Timeshare segment revenues totaled $1,502 million and $1,279 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Including our three joint ventures, contract sales increased 31 percent, primarily due to strong demand in South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, California, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and Aruba. The favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales services revenue, higher margins, primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs, and the mix of units sold, partially offset by $24 million of higher administrative expenses. Our note sales gain of $64 million was flat compared to the prior year. In addition, we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a $7 million charge in 2004. Reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion. Synthetic Fuel See the “Synthetic Fuel” caption in the Part I, Item 1 “Business” section earlier in this report for information related to our synthetic fuel investment and how we have accounted for that investment. The tables below detail the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our management evaluates the figures presented in the “Before Syn. Fuel” columns because management expects the Synthetic Fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the Internal Revenue Code Section 29 synthetic fuel tax credits expire at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core Lodging operations. Management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies. However, the figures presented in the “Before Syn. Fuel” columns are non-GAAP financial measures, may be calculated and/or presented differently than presentations of other companies, and are not alternatives to operating income, total tax (provision) benefit, income from continuing operations, or any other operating measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 40 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 For 2005, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $421 million versus revenue of $321 million for the prior year, primarily due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue for the entire 2005 year compared with only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. The $18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $125 million from $107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through May 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE II facilities that were then under IRS review and higher gains and other income, partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through March 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE I facility that was not under IRS review. In addition, in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004. Gains and other income represents net earn-out payments received. Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $47 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year-end. For 2005, minority interest represents our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year.

The $11 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $107 million in 2004 from $96 million in the prior year is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004. Gains and other income of $28 million represents net earn-out payments received. In addition, equity losses of $28 million include net earn-out payments made of $6 million. Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures. Minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit, along with its share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put option’s expiration date. For 2004, minority interest reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004, when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R), through year-end.

The SOP is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Under the SOP, we will charge the majority of the costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We will also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We will also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess profits as a reduction of inventory costs. We estimate that the initial adoption of the SOP in our 2006 first quarter, which we will report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal year 2006 financial statements, will result in a one-time non-cash after-tax charge of approximately $110 million to $115 million, consisting primarily of the write-off of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserves on notes. We estimate the ongoing impact of the adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. 42 Table of Contents FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS No. 123R”), which is a revision of FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” FAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends FAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” We will adopt FAS No. 123R at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year. We estimate the adoption of FAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective method, will result in incremental pre-tax expense in fiscal year 2006 of approximately $44 million, based on our current share-based payment compensation plans, assumptions reflecting currently available information and recent interpretations related to accounting for share-based awards granted to eligible retirees. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services We completed the sale of our senior living management business along with a parcel of land to Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. and the sale of nine senior living communities to CNL Retirement Properties, Inc., in 2003 for $266 million. We recorded an after-tax gain on disposal of $19 million and after-tax income from operations of $7 million in 2003 associated with our discontinued senior living services business. Distribution Services In 2005 and 2004, we had income, net of tax of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with the distribution services business we exited in 2002. 43 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of $2.0 billion expiring in 2010, which supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. This facility became effective on June 6, 2005, replacing two multicurrency credit agreements in the same aggregate amount which would otherwise have expired in 2006. As with the facilities it replaced, borrowings under this new facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on our public debt rating. With the exception of the 2010 expiration date, the material terms of the new credit agreement are the same as those of the replaced agreements. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. At year-end 2005 we had no loans and $93 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. At year-end 2005 our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.611 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at $2.0 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of $203 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $93 million and a $499 million reserve for outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. In the fourth quarter of 2005 we began issuing short-term commercial paper in Europe in addition to our long-standing commercial paper program in the United States. Our U.S. and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash from operations $ 837 $ 891 $ 403 Depreciation expense 156 133 132 Amortization expense 28 33 28 44 Table of Contents While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare business): ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ 40 $ 93 $ (94 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (441 ) (459 ) (247 ) Loan repurchases (23 ) (18 ) (19 ) Note sale gains (69 ) (64 ) (64 ) Note sale proceeds 399 312 231 Financially reportable sales (in excess of) less than closed sales (57 ) 129 (4 ) Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 90 94 50 Other cash inflows 55 26 36 Net cash (outflows) inflows from timeshare activity $ (6 ) $ 113 $ (111 ) Our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. Loans to timeshare owners, including a current portion of $33 million, totaled $344 million at year-end 2005. Loans to timeshare owners, including a current portion of $26 million, totaled $315 million at year-end 2004. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly one to one at year-end 2005 and 0.8 to one at year-end 2004. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 4.3 x 4.7 x 3.6 x 3.2 x 2.4 x Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $780 million in 2005, $181 million in 2004 and $210 million in 2003 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Included in the 2005 capital expenditures are the properties purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. as described below. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. During the 2005 third quarter, we purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively “CTF”) 13 properties (in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTF’s leasehold rights) and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate price of $381 million. Prior to the sale, all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries. 45 Table of Contents We plan to sell eight of the properties we have purchased to date to third-party owners, and the balances related to these properties are classified within the “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities of assets held for sale” captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. One operating lease has terminated. We operate the four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with CTF in the second quarter of 2005, we remain obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third-party consents. On the closing date we and CTF also modified management agreements on 29 other CTF-leased hotels, 28 located in Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $79 million remained in these trust accounts at the end of 2005. Our financial statements reflect us as lessee on these hotels. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $32 million in 2006; $33 million in 2007; $33 million in 2008; $33 million in 2009; $33 million in 2010 and $231 million thereafter, for a total of $395 million. For the remaining 13 European leased hotels, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF obtains releases from landlords of our back-up guarantees. Pending completion of the CTF-landlord agreements, we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. CTF has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $217 million will decline. We also continue to manage three hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and continue to manage 14 properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTF’s principals are officers, directors and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the owners of the United Kingdom and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties. We and CTF also exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date, and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed. Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (“Sunstone”) for $419 million, eight properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. (“Walton Street”) for $578 million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels (“Tarsadia”) for $29 million, in each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long-term management agreements with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired. The two properties purchased by Tarsadia are being operated under short-term management and franchise agreements. When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005 second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pre-tax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these transactions. As described above, we entered into new long-term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street and Sunstone at the closing of the transactions, and we expect to sell most of the properties we acquired subject to long-term management agreements. In 2005, we also purchased two full-service properties for aggregate cash consideration of $146 million. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $298 million in 2005, $402 million in 2004 and $494 million in 2003. Property and asset sales in 2005 primarily consisted of land parcel sales, including those as described below, and we also sold two minority interests in joint ventures. Late in 2005 we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40 million, to Courtyard by Marriott Land Joint Venture limited partnership (“CBM Land JV”), a joint venture the majority of which is owned by Sarofim Realty Advisors on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 46 Table of Contents 75 Courtyard hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of $5 million of pre-tax gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture, and we also deferred recognition of $40 million of pre-tax gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2005, amounted to $650 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $59 million (which included a current portion of $2 million) at year-end 2005 and $75 million (which included a current portion of $17 million) at year-end 2004. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $274 million (which included a current portion of $13 million) at year-end 2005 and $867 million (which included a current portion of $25 million) at year-end 2004. In 2005 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $609 million and primarily reflects the repayment of several loans including the loan associated with our Courtyard joint venture (described more fully below under the “Courtyard Joint Venture” caption). Unfunded commitments aggregating $11 million were outstanding at year-end 2005, of which we expect to fund $5 million in 2006. Investment in Leveraged Lease. At year-end 2005, we have a $23 million gross investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc., which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wishes to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment is impaired, and have recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $17 million in 2005, leaving a net exposure of $6 million. Equity and Cost Method Investments Cash outflows of $231 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in the 2005 second quarter of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (“Whitbread”) to acquire Whitbread’s portfolio of 46 franchised Marriott and Renaissance hotels totaling over 8,000 rooms, and for us to take over management of the entire portfolio of hotels upon the transfer of the hotels to the new joint venture. Whitbread sold its interest in the 46 hotels to the joint venture for approximately £995 million. Whitbread received approximately £710 million in cash (including £620 million from senior debt proceeds) and 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture and non-voting deferred consideration shares valued at £285 million. We contributed approximately £90 million ($171 million) in the second quarter of 2005 for the remaining 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture. The joint venture is currently discussing the sale of the hotels with a potential purchaser. As the joint venture sells the hotels, our interest in the joint venture will be redeemed. The joint venture expects to sell the hotels in early 2006 subject to long-term management agreements with us. In 2005 we also contributed cash of $35 million and a note of $40 million for a $75 million 50 percent interest in a joint venture developing a mixed-use project, consisting of timeshare, fractional, and whole ownership products in Hawaii. We expect sales will begin in late 2006. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased $412 million in 2005, from $1,325 million to $1,737 million at year-end 2005, due to the issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series F Senior Notes (the “Series F Notes”), net commercial paper issuances of $499 million, and other debt increases of $69 million, partially offset by repayment upon maturity of $200 million for the Series B Senior Notes, repayment upon maturity of $275 million for the Series D Senior Notes and the $29 million (book value) debt decrease associated with the Series C and Series E debt exchange described below. Debt decreased $130 million in 2004, from $1,455 million to $1,325 million, due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zero-coupon convertible senior Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021, also known as LYONs totaling $62 million, the maturity of $46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of $22 million. In June 2005, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent Series F Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting a discount and underwriting fees, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series F Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2005. The Series F Notes will mature on June 15, 2012, and we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of 4.625% Series F Note due 2012. 47 Table of Contents In November 2005, we offered to holders of our outstanding 7 percent Series E Notes due 2008 and to holders of our outstanding 7.875 percent Series C Notes due 2009 (collectively “Old Notes”) an opportunity to exchange into new 5.81 percent Series G Notes and issued new Series G Notes in the aggregate total of $427 million to replace Old Notes that had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, comprised of $203 million of the Series E Notes and $224 million of the Series C Notes. In addition, we paid an exchange price of $31 million ($9 million for the Series E Notes and $22 million for the Series C Notes) which was equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Old Notes. Furthermore, holders who had Old Notes accepted for exchange received a cash payment of $7 million representing accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date. The exchanges are not considered to be extinguishments, and accordingly, the exchange price payment, along with the existing unamortized discounts associated with the Series C Notes and Series E Notes, are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement debt instrument using the interest method. All other third-party costs related to the exchange were expensed as incurred. Interest on the Series G Notes is payable on May 10 and November 10 of each year, beginning on May 10, 2006. The Series G Notes mature on November 10, 2015, and we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of 5.81% Series G Note due 2015. Our Series C Notes, Series E Notes, Series F Notes, and Series G Notes were all issued under an indenture with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2005, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 5.4 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.3 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.7 to one at year-end 2005. At the end of 2005, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. On December 8, 2005, we filed a “universal shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by warrants, depositary shares, rights or purchase contracts. Share Repurchases. We purchased 25.7 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $64.23 per share, 14.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2004 at an average price of $46.65 per share, and 10.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share. As of year-end 2005, 17.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. See Part I, Item 5 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Company’s share repurchases. Dividends. In May 2005, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 24 percent to $0.105 per share. Courtyard Joint Venture During the 2005 second quarter, Sarofim Realty Advisors (“Sarofim”), on behalf of an institutional investor, completed the acquisition of a 75 percent interest in the Courtyard joint venture, and we signed new long-term management agreements with the joint venture. The transaction has accelerated the pace of reinventions and upgrades at the joint venture’s 120 hotels. The termination of the previous management agreements was probable at year-end 2004. Accordingly, in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs relating to the management agreements which existed at that time, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Prior to Sarofim’s acquisition, we and Host Marriott owned equal shares in the 120-property joint venture. With the addition of the new equity, our interest in the joint venture declined to approximately 21 percent and Host Marriott’s interest declined to less than 4 percent. As part of the completed transaction, our mezzanine loan to the joint venture (including capitalized interest) totaling approximately $269 million was repaid. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2005: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Debt(1) $ 2,281 $ 127 $ 255 $ 222 $ 1,677 Capital lease obligations(1) 16 1 2 2 11 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,051 108 224 203 516 Non-recourse 432 16 34 25 357 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 395 32 66 66 231 Other long-term liabilities 49 — 7 — 42 Total contractual obligations $ 4,224 $ 284 $ 588 $ 518 $ 2,834 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year-end 2005: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 414 $ 114 $ 63 $ 49 $ 188 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 537 59 111 105 262 Total other commercial commitments $ 951 $ 173 $ 174 $ 154 $ 450 Our guarantees listed above include $69 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees above include $320 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre-existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $20 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately $217 million. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted above, as of year-end 2005 our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $11 million. We expect to fund $5 million of those commitments within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $4 million within one year and $2 million after five years. 49 Table of Contents In 2005, we assigned to a third-party our previous commitment to fund up to $129 million to the Courtyard joint venture for the primary purpose of funding the costs of renovating its properties in 2005 and 2006. Under the agreement, the third-party assumed the lending obligation to the venture. As of year-end 2005, we funded $1 million and the third-party funded $22 million under this loan commitment. The commitment to fund is reduced to $27 million in September 2006 and expires in December 2009. In total, we expect that no more than $104 million of the $129 million commitment will be funded, and other than the $1 million we already funded, we expect the third-party to provide all future fundings. We do not anticipate making further fundings ourselves, but remain secondarily obligated to the Courtyard joint venture if the third-party fails to fund. At year-end 2005, that secondary obligation totaled $106 million and is not reflected in our outstanding loan commitments discussed in the preceding paragraph. At year-end 2005 we also have commitments to invest $27 million of equity for minority interests in three partnerships, which plan to purchase both full-service and select-service hotels in the United States and Canada. At year-end 2005 we also had $93 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year-end 2005 totaled $546 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and self-insurance programs. As part of the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Base management fees $ 83 $ 72 $ 56 Incentive management fees 14 8 4 Cost reimbursements 936 802 699 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 22 29 28 Total revenue $ 1,055 $ 911 $ 787 General, administrative and other $ (19 ) $ (33 ) $ (11 ) Reimbursed costs (936 ) (802 ) (699 ) Gains and other income 54 19 21 Interest income 31 74 77 Reversal of (provision for) loan losses — 3 (2 ) Equity in (losses) earnings – Synthetic fuel — (28 ) 10 Equity in earnings (losses) – Other 36 (14 ) (17 ) 50 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2005 2004 Current assets - accounts and notes receivable $ 48 $ 72 Contract acquisition costs 26 24 Cost method investments 121 — Equity method investments 349 249 Loans to equity method investees 36 526 Other long-term receivables — 3 Other long-term assets 166 38 Long-term deferred tax asset, net 19 17 Current liabilities: Accounts payable (2 ) (3 ) Other payables and accruals (45 ) (4 ) Other long-term liabilities (101 ) (11 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: • it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and • changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 51 Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2005 our recorded investment in impaired loans was $184 million. We have a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $181 million. During 2005 and 2004, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $182 million and $161 million, respectively. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 52 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair-value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in equity prices from our investments in common stock, which have a carrying value of $53 million at year-end 2005 and are accounted for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2005 we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating-rate of interest and pay a fixed-rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our Timeshare segment note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $380 million, and they expire through 2022. • Forward foreign exchange and option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2005. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is approximately $27 million, and they expire throughout 2006. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $544 million at year-end 2005, and they expire throughout 2006. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts have a dollar notional equivalent of $229 million at year-end 2005, and they expire throughout 2006. 53 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year-end 2005: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 There- after Total Carrying Amount Total Fair Value Assets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,832 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into six business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership properties; (2) operating the resorts; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. Generally, lodging demand remained robust through 2006, driven by continued strength associated with business and leisure travelers, while lodging supply growth continued to remain low. At the property level, these factors enabled us to increase rates and improve revenue mix, which resulted in strong year-over-year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This deliberate strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year-over-year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. Rates have also increased as stronger demand enabled us to reduce available discounts and special rates. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in most markets around the world, and the weak U.S. dollar continues to drive international travelers into the United States. For our North American properties, RevPAR increases in 2006 as compared to the year ago period were particularly strong in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle. Across the U.S., demand also strengthened in many smaller city and suburban markets during 2006. Internationally, RevPAR increases in 2006 versus the prior year were particularly strong in China, Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multi-channel central reservations system and desired property amenities including meeting and banquet facilities, fitness centers, spas, award-winning restaurants and high-speed and wireless Internet access. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of both new and renovated properties, new room and public space designs, enhanced amenities and technology offerings. See the “Risk Factors,” section of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Continuing Operations Revenues 2006 Compared to 2005 Revenues increased 5 percent to $12,160 million in 2006 from $11,550 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, partially offset by a decline in revenue associated with our synthetic fuel operation. Base management and franchise fees increased $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period 24 Table of Contents results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees improved $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13 formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”). See Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the 2006 first quarter; five properties were sold in the 2006 second quarter; and two properties were sold in the 2006 third quarter. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell-out. As compared to 2005, synthetic fuel revenue was significantly lower in 2006, primarily due to the suspensions of production in 2006 as a result of high oil prices. Synthetic fuel production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 5 percent increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark-up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms), net, and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms), net, to our system in 2006. 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed CTF properties. The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and wage increases. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms), net, to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section), and we also added 49 franchised properties (6,333 rooms), net, to our system in 2005. Operating Income 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income increased $456 million to $1,011 million in 2006 from $555 million in the prior year. The increase in 2006 is, in part, due to a combined base, franchise and incentive fee increase of $197 million, reflecting stronger RevPAR growth, unit growth and property-level margin improvements. Stronger owned, leased, corporate 25 Table of Contents housing and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed $17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the CTF properties acquired in 2005. The $17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of $20 million, a $12 million increase in termination fees received and $5 million of higher other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower land lease income. Also reflected in the year-over-year change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling $7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from “held for sale” to “held and used.” The depreciation charges totaling $7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as “held and used.” Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased $98 million in 2006 and largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the “Revenue” discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million favorable variance, development revenue net of expenses increased $14 million and financing, services and other revenue net of expenses increased $7 million. Increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” (“SOP 04-2”), implemented in 2006. Increased financing, services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006. As compared to the year ago period, general, administrative and other expenses decreased by $76 million. In 2005, we incurred general, administrative and other expenses of $94 million primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the CTF transaction. We also incurred general, administrative and other expenses of $30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program. We implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year-end 2005. Further impacting general, administrative and other expenses, 2005 reflected performance cure payments of $15 million versus a $6 million similar payment in 2006, and 2005 also reflected $9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional $5 million of guarantee charges in 2006. Additionally impacting the year-over-year general, administrative and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling $6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of $5 million in 2005. Also impacting the year-over-year change in general, administrative and other expenses, development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As noted under the heading “New Accounting Standards,” later in this report, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with share-based compensation. This new standard resulted in incremental general, administrative and other expenses of $39 million versus 2005, primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general, administrative and other expenses. Of the $76 million decrease in total general, administrative and other expenses, a decrease of $124 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $48 million increase was unallocated. Finally, operating income for 2006 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of $76 million versus an operating loss of $144 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting production suspensions in 2006 due to high oil prices. For additional information, see our “Synthetic Fuel” segment discussion later in this report. 2005 Compared to 2004 Operating income increased $78 million to $555 million in 2005 from $477 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the following items: a combined base, incentive and franchise fee improvement of $154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment; $51 million of stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue; and $65 million of stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses. The fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, including the CTF properties, and to a lesser extent the strong demand environment in 2005, and our receipt in 2005, of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. The favorable items noted above were also partially offset by $146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and $46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses. Increased general, administrative and other expenses were associated with our Lodging segments as unallocated general, administrative and other expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflects a $94 million charge impacting our North American Full-Service and International Lodging segments, primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements associated with our acquisition of the CTF properties, and $30 million of 26 Table of Contents expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, impacting our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service and International Lodging segments. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 also reflect pre-tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties, a $9 million pre-tax charge associated with three guarantees, increased other net overhead costs of $13 million including costs related to the Company’s unit growth, development and systems, and $2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by $5 million of lower litigation expenses. Additionally, in 2004, general, administrative and other expenses included a $13 million charge associated with the write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs. Operating income for 2005 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of $144 million versus a $98 million operating loss in the prior year, reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. For additional information, see our “Synthetic Fuel” segment discussion later in this report. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for 2006, 2005 and 2004. ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Timeshare segment note sale gains $ — $ 69 $ 64 Synthetic fuel earn-out payments (made) received, net (15 ) 32 28 Loss on expected land sale (37 ) — — Gains on sales of real estate and other 26 34 48 Other note sale/repayment gains 2 25 5 Gains on sale/income on redemption of joint venture investments 68 7 19 Income from cost method joint ventures 15 14 — $ 59 $ 181 $ 164 Gains on sale/income on redemption of joint venture investments of $68 million in 2006 represents $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and $25 million of income associated with the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee. As further explained in the earlier “Revenues” discussion for 2006, Timeshare segment note sale gains of $77 million in 2006 are presented in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. Interest Expense 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest expense increased $18 million (17 percent) to $124 million in 2006 from $106 million in 2005. Included within interest expense for 2006 are charges totaling $46 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates and Self-Insurance programs. The increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Interest expense also increased in 2006, due to our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance, our June 2006 Series H Notes issuance, and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Notes for lower interest rate Series G Notes in 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest expense increased $7 million (7 percent) to $106 million in 2005 from $99 million in the prior year, reflecting increased debt levels, which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005. Interest expense in 2005 reflected our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance and, versus the prior year, higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling $29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates and Self-Insurance programs. The increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties. 27 Table of Contents Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $34 million (43 percent) to $45 million in 2006 from $79 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005. Also reflected in the decrease versus the prior year are $4 million of mark-to-market expenses in 2006 associated with hedges for our synthetic fuel operations. Loan loss provisions decreased $31 million versus the prior year reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling $3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report for additional information, and an $11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property. Our tax provision totaled $286 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of $94 million in 2005. The difference of $192 million is primarily attributable to $96 million of higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pre-tax income from our lodging operations and $96 million of lower tax credits and tax benefit in 2006 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of $94 million in 2006 compared to a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005. As discussed in more detail in the “Synthetic Fuel” segment caption later in this report, 2006 includes a provision for an estimated 39 percent phase-out of tax credits associated with the synthetic fuel operations due to high oil prices. 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $67 million (46 percent) to $79 million in 2005 from $146 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us. Our provision for loan losses increased $36 million versus the prior year reflecting an $11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease and the reversal in 2004 of loan loss provisions totaling $8 million. Our tax provision totaled $94 million in 2005 compared to a tax provision of $100 million in 2004. The difference of $6 million is primarily attributable to $19 million of higher taxes in 2005 associated with higher pre-tax income from our lodging operations, more than offset by $25 million of higher tax credits and tax benefit in 2005 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005 compared to a net tax benefit of $165 million in 2004, and to a lesser extent, to a lower tax rate before the impact of the Synthetic Fuel segment in 2005, as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2006 Compared to 2005 The $33 million decline from earnings of $36 million in 2005 to earnings of $3 million in 2006, attributable to our equity investments, reflected the recognition in 2005 of $30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests. In addition, since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures. 2005 Compared to 2004 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees increased $78 million from a net loss of $42 million in 2004 to net earnings of $36 million in 2005. Twenty-eight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures that we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter, versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. The remaining $50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to several joint ventures with significant asset sales in 2005, favorably impacting the profitability of the joint ventures, producing higher earnings from joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year. Minority Interest 2006 Compared to 2005 Minority interest decreased $39 million in 2006 from a benefit of $45 million in 2005 to a benefit of $6 million. On the first day of our 2006 fiscal year, we redeemed our partner’s interest in Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises II, LLC (“SAFE II”), which owns three of our four synthetic fuel production facilities. Also, effective October 1, 2006, we purchased our partner’s interest in Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises I, LLC (“SAFE I”). Accordingly, in 2006, minority interest represents only our partner’s share of the losses in SAFE I, through 28 Table of Contents September 30, 2006. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for all four production facilities. In addition, synthetic fuel operating losses in 2006 were significantly lower versus 2005 reflecting reduced production. For additional information, see Footnote No. 2, “Synthetic Fuel,” later in this report. 2005 Compared to 2004 Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $45 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year-end. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. Income from Continuing Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Compared to 2005, income from continuing operations increased $49 million (7 percent) to $717 million in 2006, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.21 (14 percent) to $1.66. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income ($197 million), lower general, administrative and other expenses ($76 million), lower synthetic fuel operating losses ($68 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses ($17 million), a lower loan loss provision ($31 million) and higher timeshare interval sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($98 million). Partially offsetting these favorable variances, were significantly higher taxes ($192 million), lower gains and other income ($122 million), lower interest income ($34 million), higher interest expense ($18 million), a lower minority interest benefit ($39 million) and lower equity investment results ($33 million). 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from continuing operations increased $74 million (12 percent) to $668 million in 2005 versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.21 (17 percent) to $1.45. As discussed above in more detail, the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment for lodging, increased owned, leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses ($65 million), principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter, increased timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($51 million), stronger equity investment results ($78 million), higher gains and other income ($17 million) and lower taxes ($6 million). As discussed earlier in the report in more detail, increased general, administrative and other expenses ($146 million) reflected, among other things, the write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the CTF transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, higher synthetic fuel operating losses ($46 million), lower interest income ($67 million), higher interest expense ($7 million) and a higher loan loss provision ($36 million) partially offset these favorable items. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The initial adoption of SOP 04-2 in our 2006 first quarter, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statement of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $105 million ($0.24 per diluted share). As a result of tax rate adjustments in the 2006 fourth quarter, we reduced the tax benefit associated with the initial adoption from $68 million to $64 million. Accordingly, the after-tax impact of 29 Table of Contents the adoption was $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). As a result of the change, “Net Income” of $65 million ($0.15 per diluted share) as reported in the 2006 first quarter, now totals $61 million ($0.14 per diluted share). The pre-tax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are a member, and the Staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had communications regarding SOP 04-2 and the income statement presentation of timeshare note securitizations gains. As a result of those communications, we reclassified in our 2006 third quarter, in our Consolidated Statement of Income, Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $40 million recognized in the 2006 second quarter from the “Gains and other income” caption to the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. As a result of the change, “Timeshare sales and services” revenue of $331 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $371 million, and “Gains and other income” of $48 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $8 million. Including $37 million of Timeshare segment note securitization gains recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter, full-year 2006 note securitization gains totaling $77 million are reflected within our “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2007 through 2026, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $1.9 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in six business segments: • North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport brands located in the continental United States and Canada; • North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites and Marriott ExecuStay brands located in the continental United States and Canada; • International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International and Marriott Executive Apartments brands located outside the continental United States and Canada; • Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brands worldwide; • Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and sale of timeshare, fractional and whole ownership properties under the Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands worldwide; and • Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. In 2006, the company analyzed its internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency. As part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting and made certain changes that were in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These reporting changes are in conformity with the requirements of FAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” (“FAS No. 131”) and will better enable investors to view the Company the way management views it. Accordingly, we now report six operating segments as compared to five before the change and indirect administrative expenses are no longer allocated to our segments. Senior management allocates resources and assesses performance based on the six operating segments. The revised segment reporting is reflected throughout this report for all periods presented. Historical figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense or indirect general, administrative and other expenses. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes or interest income to our segments. As note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. “Other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. 30 Table of Contents We have aggregated the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International and Luxury segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational structure and management reporting structure.

We consider Lodging revenues and Lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. 32 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 We added 136 properties (23,466 rooms) and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system in 2006. Most of the properties that left the system were limited-service properties. Lodging financial results increased $314 million to $1,415 million in 2006 from $1,101 million in 2005, and revenues increased $857 million to $11,930 million in 2006, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,073 million in 2005. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $197 million (19 percent) increase in combined base, franchise and incentive fees from $1,027 million in 2005 to $1,224 million in 2006, $124 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses, $8 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and $98 million of higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $78 million of lower gains and other income and a $37 million decline in earnings associated with equity investments. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth drove the increase in base and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased $80 million (40 percent) during 2006, reflecting the impact of strong room rate improvement and property-level margin improvements. Incentive fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. In 2006, 62 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 51 percent in 2005. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased 9.1 percent over 2005, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased 8.9 percent. North American company-operated house profit margins improved 240 basis points versus 2005. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 10.5 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased 11.1 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.4 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased 9.5 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 230 basis points. 2005 Compared to 2004 We added 134 properties (21,611 rooms) and 25 properties (4,755 rooms) left the system in 2005. Most of the properties that left the system were Fairfield Inn properties. Lodging financial results increased $184 million to $1,101 million in 2005 from $917 million in 2004, and revenues increased $1,340 million to $11,073 million in 2005, a 14 percent increase from revenues of $9,733 million in 2004. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $154 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $873 million in 2004 to $1,027 million in 2005, $54 million of higher owned, lease and other revenue net of expenses, an increase of $51 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses, $49 million of increased equity results, and increased gains and other income of $12 million, partially offset by $134 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international rate increases and new unit growth. Incentive management fees increased $59 million (42 percent) in 2005 versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased travel worldwide, driving strong property-level profits. The increase also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. In 2005, 51 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 32 percent in 2004. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased 9.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased 9.8 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 11.9 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased 11.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased 10.1 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.9 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 180 basis points. 33 Table of Contents Lodging Development We opened 136 properties totaling 23,466 rooms, across our brands in 2006, and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system. Highlights of the year included: • We converted 30 properties (6,869 rooms), or 29 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 27 percent of the rooms were located in international markets; • We opened over 28 percent of the new rooms outside the United States; • We added 91 properties (11,281 rooms) to our Limited-Service brands; and • We opened our second Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brand property in Bali, Indonesia in September 2006. We currently have approximately 100,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our pipeline, and we expect to add approximately 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2007. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. RevPAR The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region and the principal brand in our Luxury Segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005 through December 29, 2006, the statistics for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005 through December 30, 2005, and the statistics for 2004 include the period from January 3, 2004 through December 31, 2004 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 34 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable Systemwide North American Properties (1) 2006 Change vs. 2005 2006 Change vs. 2005 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 72.3 % -0.6 % pts. 70.9 % 0.2 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 5,196 $ 5,116 $ 4,691 2 % 9 % Segment results $ 455 $ 349 $ 337 30 % 4 % 2006 Compared to 2005 In 2006, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,971 rooms) and six properties (1,604 rooms) left the system. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased 8.5 percent to $121.10. Occupancy for these properties decreased 0.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 9.0 percent to $167.27. Compared to the prior year, our 2006 results reflect a $59 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, to higher food and beverage, meeting room rental and other revenue and productivity improvements, all of which favorably impacted property-level house profit margins. The growth in the number of rooms, year-over-year, also contributed to the increase in fees. Incentive fees included $10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized. Similarly, base management fees for 2006 included $4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2006. Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased $8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property, partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of $10 million in termination fees. General, administrative and other expenses decreased $69 million as a result of, among other things, a $60 million charge in 2005, associated with the CTF transaction, more fully discussed in the previous “Operating Income” discussion, as well as expenses of $14 million in 2005, related to our bedding incentive program, partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development, systems improvements and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. In 2005, general, administrative and other expenses included $3 million of performance cure payments associated with one property. In 2006, general, administrative and other expenses included a $5 million performance cure payment. Gains and other income was $3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties. Gains and other income for 2006 reflected a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease, as further described in the “Expected Land Sale” caption later in this report. Equity results decreased by $19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures’ sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006, offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment. 2005 Compared to 2004 In 2005, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (6,141 rooms) and five properties (1,995 rooms) left the system. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased 9.6 percent to $112.41. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 7.5 percent to $154.00. Compared to the prior year, our 2005 segment results reflect a $58 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees and $35 million of increased owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases that favorably impact property-level house profits, the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of $10 million of 41 Table of Contents incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, many of which were sold throughout 2006 as expected, including the CTF properties. In addition, owned, leased and other revenue in 2005 reflected our receipt of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. Somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances were $78 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. As noted in the preceding “Operating Income” discussion, during 2005 we recorded a $60 million pre-tax charge, primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF management agreements, and we incurred expenses of $14 million related to our bedding incentive program, both of which impacted our general, administrative and other expenses. In 2005, we also recorded performance termination cure payments of $3 million associated with one property, which impacted general, administrative and other expenses. In addition, in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development. Further impacting segment results, gains and other income was $15 million lower than the prior year, while equity results increased by $13 million versus the prior year. The decrease in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the $13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the Two Flags Joint Venture. The increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures that had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains, and to a lesser extent, the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments. North American Limited-Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 2,060 $ 1,886 $ 1,673 9 % 13 % Segment results $ 380 $ 303 $ 233 25 % 30 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 91 properties (11,329 rooms) and 28 properties (3,647 rooms) left the system in 2006. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased 9.1 percent to $84.41. Occupancy for these properties decreased 0.8 percentage points to 73.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 10.4 percent to $115.24. The $77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $77 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $27 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses and $6 million of increased equity results, partially offset by $14 million of lower owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and $19 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Stronger performance at our renovated Courtyard properties, versus nonrenovated properties, is also contributing to the increase in segment results over the prior year. The decrease in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale, late in 2005, of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $11 million associated with our bedding incentive program, a $6 million litigation charge and a $3 million guarantee charge. Improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006, new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. Gains and other income decreased $19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture, partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of $4 million in 2006 and increased income of $4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures. 42 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 94 properties (11,170 rooms) and 18 properties (2,309 rooms) left the system in 2005. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased 9.4 percent to $76.49. Occupancy for these properties increased 0.5 percentage points to 73.8 percent, while average daily rates increased 8.7 percent to $103.70. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms. The $70 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $57 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $8 million of lower owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, $3 million of higher gains and other income, an $11 million increase in equity results, and $7 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included $11 million of expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. In 2004 we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs, impacting general, administrative and other expenses, totaling $13 million. The 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, which generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture and increased income of $4 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures, partially offset by $27 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales. The decline in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to our ExecuStay brand’s shift to franchising. Improved equity results primarily reflect the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the 2005 first quarter versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. Stronger performance at our reinvented Courtyard properties, versus non-reinvented properties, is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year. For additional information related to the Courtyard Joint Venture, see the “Courtyard Joint Venture” caption in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this report. International Lodging includes our International Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, International Courtyard, International Fairfield Inn, International Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,411 $ 1,017 $ 604 39 % 68 % Segment results $ 237 $ 133 $ 109 78 % 22 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 22 properties (5,242 rooms) and 10 properties (3,136 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased 11.1 percent to $114.61. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.2 percentage points to 74.4 percent, while average daily rates increased 9.4 percent to $153.99. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and certain Middle Eastern countries all had strong RevPAR increases. The $104 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $43 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $37 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses, $29 million of increased owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in gains and other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower equity results. Incentive fees included $10 million and $4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings, but not earned and due until the periods they were recognized. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Equity results decreased $20 million in 2006 versus 2005 and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $14 million in equity earnings from a joint venture as a result of the venture’s sale of a hotel and $4 million of increased equity losses in 2006 associated with one joint venture’s hotel that was closed for renovation. The increase of $29 million in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct 43 Table of Contents expenses reflects $19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of $12 million for termination fees for several properties. The $19 million improvement in owned and lease results also reflects the impact of a $5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” as it was not sold within one year of its classification as “held for sale,” as expected. The $15 million increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006, partially offset by lower other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a $34 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure. Also impacting general, administrative and other expenses, in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees, and 2006 reflected $7 million of increased expenses related to unit growth and development, systems improvements and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 18 properties (3,217 rooms) and three properties (696 rooms) left the system in 2005. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international hotels increased 11.3 percent to $117.17. Occupancy for these hotels increased 1.6 percentage points to 73.6 percent, while average daily rates increased 8.9 percent to $159.30. Financial results for our international operations were strong across most regions. In 2005 we experienced strong demand particularly in China, Mexico, the Caribbean and Egypt. The European markets generally remained less robust. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our international brands. The $24 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $26 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, a $25 million increase in owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in equity results, partially offset by a $46 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses. Incentive fees for 2005 include the recognition of $4 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses increased $25 million reflecting properties acquired in 2005 as well as the impact of the stronger demand environment in 2005. Gains and other income increased $5 million in 2005 versus the prior year primarily reflecting increased cost method joint venture income associated with one new investment. Equity results increased $15 million and primarily reflect a joint venture with significant asset sale activity in 2005 that increased the profitability of the joint venture. In addition, equity results were impacted by the more favorable demand environment in 2005 versus the prior year as well as the mix of investments. General, administrative and other expenses increased $46 million in 2005 and included a $34 million pre-tax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF Management Agreements and $5 million of higher expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. Furthermore, in 2005 we also recorded charges totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees, which impacted general, administrative and other expenses. Luxury Lodging includes our The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,423 $ 1,333 $ 1,263 7 % 6 % Segment results $ 63 $ 45 $ 35 40 % 29 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added three properties (424 rooms) and one property (229 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased 9.7 percent to $209.88. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, while average daily rates increased 7.5 percent to $289.50. 44 Table of Contents The $18 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $16 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses and $1 million of higher owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $7 million is attributable to a 2005 performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property, partially offset by a $5 million increase in expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development and an increase in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Gains and other income decreased $5 million in 2006 as a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property, partially offset by gains totaling $3 million associated with the 2006 sale of a preferred interest in one property. 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added two properties (699 rooms) in 2005. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased 18.3 percent to $143.30. Occupancy for these properties increased 3.4 percentage points to 71.6 percent, while average daily rates increased 12.7 percent to $200.08. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms. The $10 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $9 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, a $2 million increase in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and $13 million of higher gains and other income, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included a performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property. The 2005 increase in gains and other income versus 2004 is a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property and other real estate sale gains. Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,840 $ 1,721 $ 1,502 7 % 15 % Segment results $ 280 $ 271 $ 203 3 % 33 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Timeshare contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, which represents sales of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, increased 17 percent over 2005. Timeshare segment revenues of $1,840 million and $1,721 million, in 2006 and 2005, respectively, include interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales, base management fees, resort rental fees and cost reimbursements. Timeshare segment revenues also include $41 million and $38 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. The $119 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues reflects a $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $27 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue and $2 million of increased base management fees. The $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed earlier in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Segment results of $280 million in 2006 increased $9 million over 2005. The $9 million increase includes an increase of $98 million for Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses and a $2 million increase in base management fees, partially offset by a decline of $72 million in gains and other income, a $16 million increase in general and administrative expenses and $3 million of lower joint venture equity earnings. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $98 million largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the “Revenue” discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also 45 Table of Contents reflected in the $98 million variance, development revenue net of expenses increased $14 million primarily reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with SOP 04-2, implemented in 2006. Additionally the $98 million variance reflected a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and $12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense, partially offset by $21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. The $3 million decline in equity income primarily reflects start-up loses associated with several new joint ventures, partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures. The $72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected $69 million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006, while the $16 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development expenses and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. 2005 Compared to 2004 Timeshare segment revenues were $1,721 million and $1,502 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Timeshare segment revenues include $38 million and $23 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Timeshare contract sales were flat as compared to the prior year, reflecting limited available inventory at several projects in 2005 that were approaching sell-out status versus higher contract sales at those projects in the prior year. The favorable segment results compared with 2004 reflect a $51 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue under the percentage of completion accounting, a higher development margin, primarily resulting from the mix of units sold, and higher financing income reflecting a higher average notes receivable portfolio balance in 2005. In addition, compared with 2004, base fees increased $4 million, gains and other income increased $6 million, equity earnings increased $8 million, and general, administrative and other expenses increased $1 million. Improved equity results primarily reflect start-up losses in 2004 versus earnings in 2005 associated with one joint venture, and the increase in gains and other income is attributable to note sales that generated gains of $69 million in 2005 compared to $64 million in 2004. In 2005 we also decided to cease development of one land parcel, and we recorded a $7 million charge in conjunction with the write-off of the previously capitalized costs that impacted our timeshare direct expenses. Synthetic Fuel See Footnote No. 2, “Synthetic Fuel,” and Footnote No. 18, “Contingencies,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. The tables that follow detail the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our income from continuing operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Our management evaluates the figures presented in the “Before Syn. Fuel Impact” columns because management expects the Synthetic Fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the Internal Revenue Code synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core Lodging operations. Management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies. However, the figures presented in the “Before Syn. Fuel Impact” columns are non-GAAP financial measures, may be calculated and/or presented differently than presentations of other companies, and are not alternatives to operating income, total tax (provision) benefit, income from continuing operations, or any other operating measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 2006 Compared to 2005 For 2006, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $165 million versus revenue of $421 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. The $76 million operating loss for 2006 includes a $5 million charge reflecting the write-down of assets at the Alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at year-end, and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location. Gains and other income (expense) reflects either net earn-out payments received or net earn-out payments made. In 2006, net earn-out payments made totaled $15 million, while in 2005 net earn-out payments received totaled $32 million. Lower minority interest income primarily reflects the redemption, early in 2006, of our partner’s interest in SAFE II. Additionally, lower minority interest income in 2006 also reflects our buy-out in the 2006 fourth quarter of our partner’s interest in SAFE I. Interest costs in 2006 of $4 million reflect the cost of hedges entered into during 2006 in response to high oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase-out of tax credits. Income from continuing operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $125 million in 2005 to $5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phase-out of tax credits due to high oil prices in 2006. 46 Table of Contents The table below details the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2006 and 2005. 2006 2005 ($ in millions) AsReported Syn.

The $18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $125 million from $107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through May 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE II facilities that were then under IRS review and higher gains and other income, partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through March 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE I facility that was not under IRS review. In addition, in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004. Gains and other income represents net earn-out payments received. Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $47 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year-end. For 2005, minority interest represents our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. 47 Table of Contents The table below details the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005 and 2004. 2005 2004 ($ in millions) AsReported Syn.

As noted in Footnote No. 1, “Basis of Presentation,” under the heading “New Accounting Pronouncements,” we adopted FAS No. 123(R), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” (“FAS No. 123(R)”) using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of our 2006 first quarter. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, we did not restate our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of FAS No. 123(R). For all share-based awards granted after the date we adopted FAS No. 123(R) and for the unvested portion of previously granted share-based awards that were outstanding on that date, FAS No. 123(R) requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. Previously, under FAS No. 123 and APB Opinion No. 25, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB Opinion No. 25”) and recognized share-based compensation expense for all awards except for our Stock Option Program awards. Share-based compensation expense totaled $62 million and $47 million for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Under FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share-based compensation expense of $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $168 million at year-end 2006, and the weighted average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is two years. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $137 million at year-end 2005. FAS No. 123(R) requires that share-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service (the “substantive vesting period”). In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we showed share-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirement-eligible employees over the 48 Table of Contents awards’ stated vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share-based compensation expense for our other awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards’ stated vesting period. With the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption of FAS No. 123(R) and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No. 123(R). In connection with the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we reviewed, among other things, our forfeiture and volatility assumptions. Estimated volatilities for 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s or share appreciation right’s expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2006 were a product of the lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms. In August 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Comprehensive Plan to provide participants the ability, during a limited time frame in 2005, to elect to accelerate the schedule for distribution of certain vested deferred shares. The amendment did not alter the previously established vesting schedule. In 2005, we also changed from using the Black-Scholes option pricing method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or share appreciation right on the grant date, to using the binomial valuation method to improve the estimate of fair value. In 2005, we changed the method in which we issue share-based awards to our key employees. In prior years, share-based compensation for key employees consisted primarily of stock options. Upon consideration of several factors, we began in 2005 to award key employees a combination of stock options and restricted stock units. Therefore, this change resulted in an increase in restricted stock expense. The adoption of FAS No. 123(R) in 2006 resulted in the recognition of incremental share-based compensation costs in 2006 of $39 million, a reduction in net income of $25 million (net of tax benefits of $14 million) and a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.06. In accordance with FAS No. 123(R), we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we reported the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as operating cash flows. The adoption of FAS No. 123(R) resulted in a decrease in 2006 of $193 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $193 million in cash flows from financing activities related to excess tax benefits from share-based awards. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements was $184 million, $125 million, and $206 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the provisions of FAS No. 123(R), the “Deferred compensation” line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, a contra-equity line representing the amount of unrecognized share-based compensation costs, is no longer presented. Accordingly, the amount that had been on the “Deferred compensation” line at year-end 2005 was reversed in the 2006 first quarter through the “Additional paid-in-capital” line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” See the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” section earlier in this report for information regarding the adoption in 2006 of SOP 04-2. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year, and its provisions are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption. Upon adoption of FIN 48, only tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial statements. FAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets” In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets” (“FAS No. 156”). FAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities are to be initially measured at fair value. It also allows entities to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. 49 Table of Contents This standard is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year. We have determined that FAS No. 156 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”). This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. We are evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums” In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”). EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact that EITF 06-8 will have on our financial statements. Investment in Leveraged Lease At year-end 2006, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”), which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment was impaired, and have recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. Expected Land Sale In 1988, the Company, as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property; however, currently it is not. The lease contains contractual rental increases over the term of the lease, and annual ground rent on the land currently totals approximately $5 million. The lease also contains a provision that permits the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. The Company and the lessee have had various discussions concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006 second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties, and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the land from the “Property and equipment” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet to the “Assets held for sale” caption and recorded a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. Additional amounts may be due us depending on the lessee’s use of the land subsequent to purchase; however, such amounts will only be recorded if and when paid. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. Because that program ends with 2007 synthetic fuel production, our synthetic fuel production facilities will not be able to generate credits in future years. As a result, our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Distribution Services In 2005 and 2004, we had income, net of tax of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002. 50 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a $2.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. Effective June 6, 2006, we executed an amendment extending the maturity date for $1.955 billion of commitments under this agreement by one year to June 6, 2011. The remaining $45 million commitment still matures on June 6, 2010. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. At year-end 2006 our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.770 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at $2.0 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of $193 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $108 million and $315 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We issue short-term commercial paper in Europe and in the United States. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper in each of these markets, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash from operations $ 970 $ 837 $ 891 Depreciation expense 155 156 133 Amortization expense 33 28 33 We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2006 presentation. The reclassifications were primarily associated with Timeshare segment inventory that is now a component of “Current assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and was previously a component of “Property and equipment.” Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 0.8 to one at year-end 2006 and 0.6 to one at year-end 2005. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. 51 Table of Contents Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 4.9x 4.3x 4.7x 3.6x 3.2x While our Timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment): ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Timeshare segment development, less the cost of sales $ (83 ) $ 40 $ 93 New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (537 ) (441 ) (459 ) Loan repurchases (55 ) (23 ) (18 ) Note sale gains (77 ) (69 ) (64 ) Note sale proceeds 508 399 312 Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 61 (57 ) 129 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 96 90 94 Other cash (outflows) inflows (17 ) 26 2 Net cash (outflows) inflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (104 ) $ (35 ) $ 89 Our ability to sell Timeshare segment notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such deterioration. Loans to Timeshare segment owners, including a current portion of $70 million, totaled $386 million at year-end 2006. Loans to Timeshare segment owners, including a current portion of $33 million, totaled $344 million at year-end 2005. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $529 million in 2006, $780 million in 2005 and $181 million in 2004 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section’s narrative, are not reflected in these numbers. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $798 million in 2006, $298 million in 2005 and $402 million in 2004. In 2006 we closed on the sales of 11 hotels and seven joint venture investments. Cash proceeds of $26 million for one of the hotels sold in 2006 are not reflected in the $798 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency and impacted the other investing activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows rather than dispositions. The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale accounting was achieved in 2006. 52 Table of Contents The sold properties included eight properties purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. (and certain of its affiliates (collectively “CTF”)). For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” later in this report. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2006, amounted to $62 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $9 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year-end 2006 and $59 million (which included a current portion of $2 million) at year-end 2005. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $268 million (which included a current portion of $32 million) at year-end 2006 and $274 million (which included a current portion of $13 million) at year-end 2005. In 2006 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $56 million and primarily reflects the repayment of several loans. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures. Cash outflows of $216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased $96 million in 2006, from $1,737 million to $1,833 million at year-end 2006, due to the issuance of $349 million (book value) of Series H Senior Notes (described more fully below), partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of $184 million, and other debt decreases of $69 million. Debt increased $412 million in 2005, from $1,325 million to $1,737 million at year-end 2005, due to the issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series F Notes, net commercial paper issuances of $499 million, and other debt increases of $69 million, partially offset by repayment upon maturity of $200 million for the Series B Notes, repayment upon maturity of $275 million for the Series D Notes and the $29 million (book value) debt decrease associated with the Series C and Series E Senior Note exchanges for Series G Senior Notes as described in Footnote No. 12, “Long-term Debt,” in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the 2006 second quarter, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.200 percent Series H Notes due in 2016 (the “Notes”). We received net proceeds of approximately $347 million from this offering, after deducting a discount, underwriting fees, and other expenses, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Notes is paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, with the first interest payment occurring on December 15, 2006. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2016, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of Note. The Notes were issued under an indenture with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as the Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2006, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 5.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.9 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.7 to one at year-end 2005. At the end of 2006, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. Share Repurchases. We purchased 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share, 51.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $32.12 per share, and 28.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2004 at an average price of $23.33 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year-end 2006, 34.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In April 2006, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 19 percent to $0.0625 per share. 53 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Debt (1) $ 2,524 $ 108 $ 371 $ 187 $ 1,858 Capital lease obligations (1) 99 9 80 2 8 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,021 122 233 205 461 Non-recourse 460 21 35 32 372 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 388 35 71 68 214 Other long-term liabilities 65 — 23 1 41 Total contractual obligations $ 4,557 $ 295 $ 813 $ 495 $ 2,954 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year-end 2006: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 268 $ 19 $ 66 $ 16 $ 167 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 501 61 108 137 195 Total other commercial commitments $ 769 $ 80 $ 174 $ 153 $ 362 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor listed above include $43 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable above include $283 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”) is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $22 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $218 million. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. CTF has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $218 million will decline. In addition to the guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, from time to time we provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the joint venture 54 Table of Contents owner or our own actions. We have also provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $524 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2006, we had extended approximately $11 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund $5 million by year-end 2007. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $1 million within one year; $1 million in three to four years; and $4 million after five years. At year-end 2006, we also have commitments to invest $31 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase both North American full-service and limited-service hotels, which expire as follows: $5 million within one year; $21 million in one to two years; and $5 million after five years. At year-end 2006 we also had $108 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year-end 2006 totaled $640 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments in relation to our timeshare and lodging operations and self-insurance programs. As part of the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. Audit of Employee Stock Ownership Plan Transaction The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently auditing the Company’s federal tax returns for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. As part of that audit, the IRS is reviewing a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of the Company’s Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”) that was implemented in a transaction (the “ESOP Transaction”) on June 13, 2000. Principal and interest on the debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26-month period as a mechanism for funding Company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the Plan. The Company claimed federal income tax deductions for the forgiven principal on the debt in the amount of $1 billion over that period, along with forgiven interest on the debt. The benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes. Based on discussions with the IRS during the course of the audit, the IRS may seek to disallow some or all of the deductions related to the ESOP Transaction, and may seek to impose other taxes, penalties, and interest, including excise taxes for prohibited transactions under Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a January 19, 2007, letter to the Company, the U.S. Department of Labor confirmed that it is reviewing the ESOP Transaction. The Company has retained counsel to assist with the audit process and to respond to any claims or assessments the IRS or Department of Labor issues. Although we are early in the process of closing this audit, we do not expect the result of the audit to have a material impact on either equity for any lost deductions or earnings for interest or penalties, if any, related to the ESOP Transaction. 55 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Base management fees $ 62 $ 83 $ 72 Incentive management fees 22 14 8 Cost reimbursements 649 936 802 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 3 22 29 Total revenue $ 736 $ 1,055 $ 911 General, administrative and other $ (1 ) $ (19 ) $ (33 ) Reimbursed costs (649 ) (936 ) (802 ) Gains and other income 28 54 19 Interest income 4 31 74 Reversal of provision for loan losses 1 — 3 Equity in losses-Synthetic fuel — — (28 ) Equity in earnings (losses)-Other 3 36 (14 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Current assets-accounts and notes receivable $ 76 $ 47 Contract acquisition costs 34 26 Cost method investments 45 166 Equity method investments 332 349 Loans to equity method investees 27 36 Long-term deferred tax asset, net 4 19 Current liabilities: Accounts payable — (2 ) Other payables and accruals (2 ) (43 ) Other long-term liabilities (13 ) (19 ) JWM Family Enterprises, L.P. JWM Family Enterprises, L.P. (“Family Enterprises”) is a Delaware limited partnership which is beneficially owned and controlled by members of the family of J.W. Marriott, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, including John W. Marriott III, the Company’s Vice-Chairman, who is Chief Executive Officer of Family Enterprises, and J.W. Marriott, Jr. himself. In July 2006, the Company sold the Dallas, Texas, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts brand hotel to Family Enterprises for a sale price of approximately $38 million and recognized a gain of $1 million on the sale. The Company originally acquired the hotel from a third party in June 2005. The sale to Family Enterprises resulted from a competitive auction process involving other unrelated bidders in which Family Enterprises submitted the most competitive bid. 56 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: • it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and • changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $92 million. We had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2005, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $184 million. We had a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired 57 Table of Contents loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2006 and 2005, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $138 million and $182 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In conjunction with the adoption of SOP 04-2, we now record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogenous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past six years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes. At year-end 2006, our allowance for credit losses associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” totaled $29 million. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices, and for our synthetic fuel business, oil prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of $107 million at year-end 2006 and are accounted for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2006 we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $209 million, and they expire through 2022. • Option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2007. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was approximately $47 million, and they expire throughout 2007. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $217 million and they expire throughout 2007. • Oil price hedges to manage the volatility associated with oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase-out of tax credits in 2007. The hedges cover 5 million barrels of oil and expire on December 31, 2007. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts had a dollar notional equivalent of $43 million and they expire throughout 2007. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year-end 2006: ($ in millions) Maturities by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,999 properties (535,093 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2007 and include 21 home and condominium projects (1,916 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,156 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 19 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential products distinctive. Generally, lodging demand remained strong through 2007, driven by continued strength associated with worldwide business travel. In general, luxury, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than limited-service properties. Strong demand enabled us to increase rates at the property level, which resulted in solid year-over-year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year-over-year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in many markets around the world. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR increases in 2007, as compared to the year-ago period, were particularly strong in Dallas, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Internationally, 2007 RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Our approach to improving property-level and above-property productivity has benefited our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees. Driving room rate improvement, benchmarking successful performance, and leveraging our size have all contributed to property-level margin improvements and higher incentive management fees to us. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multi-channel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. In 2007, we announced our agreement with the Nickelodeon division of Viacom, Inc. and Miller Global Properties, LLC to co-develop a new lodging resort brand and concept for travelers seeking fun and adventure, “Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott.” Also during 2007, we announced our agreement with Ian Schrager to create a global boutique lifestyle hotel brand “Edition” on a large scale. See Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. 22 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Continuing Operations Revenues 2007 Compared to 2006 Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, as compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate, offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, as compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006. The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system. 2006 Compared to 2005 Revenues increased by $866 million (8 percent) to $11,995 million in 2006 from $11,129 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13 formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”). See Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the first quarter; five properties were sold in the second quarter; and two properties were sold in the third quarter. 23 Table of Contents Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell-out. The $866 million increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms) and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms) to our system in 2006, net of properties exiting the system. Operating Income 2007 Compared to 2006 Operating income increased by $101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in 2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million. The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property-level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. As compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million (13 percent) from $677 million in 2006 to $768 million in 2007. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor examination of our employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased litigation expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 as compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the year-ago period reflected $6 million of guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and a $9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required. Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million reversal of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. The $5 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, as compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned 24 Table of Contents property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 as compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.” Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties. 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income increased by $388 million (56 percent) to $1,087 million in 2006 from $699 million in the prior year. The increase in 2006 is, in part, due to a combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fee increase of $197 million, reflecting stronger RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property-level margin improvements. Stronger owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed $17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the CTF hotel properties acquired in 2005. The $17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of $20 million, a $12 million increase in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received and $5 million of higher other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower land lease income. Also reflected in the year-over-year change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling $7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from “held for sale” to “held and used.” The depreciation charges totaling $7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as “held and used.” Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased by $98 million (38 percent) in 2006 and largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the “Revenue” discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million favorable variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million and financing, services and other revenue net of expenses increased by $7 million. Increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” (“SOP 04-2”), implemented in 2006. Increased financing, services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006. As compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $76 million (10 percent) to $677 million in 2006 from $753 million in 2005. In 2005, we incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $94 million primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the CTF transaction. We also incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program. We implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year-end 2005. Further impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, 2005 reflected hotel operating agreement performance cure payments of $15 million versus a $6 million similar payment in 2006, and 2005 also reflected $9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional $5 million of guarantee charges in 2006. Additionally, impacting the year-over-year general, administrative, and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling $6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of $5 million in 2005. Also impacting the year-over-year change in general, administrative, and other expenses, an additional $22 million reflects unit growth, systems improvements, higher program and joint venture development expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As noted under the heading “New Accounting Standards” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” section of our 2006 Form 10-K, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with share-based compensation. This new standard resulted in incremental general, administrative, and other expenses of $39 million versus 2005, primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general, administrative, and other expenses. Of the $76 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $124 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $48 million increase was unallocated. 25 Table of Contents Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Timeshare note sale gains $ — $ — $ 69 Gains on sales of real estate and other 39 26 34 Loss on expected land sale — (37 ) — Other note sale/repayment gains 1 2 25 Gains on forgiveness of debt 12 — — Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments 31 68 7 Income from cost method joint ventures 14 15 14 $ 97 $ 74 $ 149 2007 Compared to 2006 The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 comprised $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee which generated a gain of $25 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 represents $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture and other investments and $25 million of income associated with the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee. As further explained in the earlier “Revenues” discussion for 2006, Timeshare segment note sale gains of $77 million in 2006 are presented in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. Interest Expense 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in 2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance which occurred late in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs; interest totaling $5 million associated with other additional debt; and the write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year-ago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects. 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest expense increased by $18 million (17 percent) to $124 million in 2006 from $106 million in 2005. Included within interest expense for 2006 and 2005 are charges totaling $46 million and $29 million, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf. The increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Interest expense also increased in 2006, due to our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance, our June 2006 Series H Notes issuance, and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Notes for lower interest rate Series G Notes in 2005. 26 Table of Contents Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49 million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings. Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge associated with one property and a $5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines, Inc. (“Delta”) lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information regarding the Delta lease investment write-off, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report. Our tax provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 to a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one-time impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $30 million (38 percent) to $49 million in 2006 from $79 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005. Loan loss provisions decreased by $31 million versus the prior year reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling $3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta lease, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report for additional information and an $11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property. Our tax provision totaled $380 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of $284 million in 2005. The difference of $96 million is attributable to higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations. Equity in Earnings 2007 Compared to 2006 Equity in earnings increased by $12 million from $3 million in 2006 to $15 million in 2007 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii. 2006 Compared to 2005 The $33 million decline from earnings of $36 million in 2005 to earnings of $3 million in 2006, attributable to our equity investments, reflected the recognition in 2005 of $30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests. In addition, since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures. Income from Continuing Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Compared to 2006, income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20 million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority interest benefit ($1 million). 27 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Compared to 2005, income from continuing operations increased by $169 million (31 percent) to $712 million in 2006, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.48 (41 percent) to $1.65. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income ($197 million), higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($98 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($76 million), a lower loan loss provision ($31 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($17 million), and lower minority interest expense ($2 million). Partially offsetting these favorable variances, were significantly higher taxes ($96 million), lower gains and other income ($75 million), lower equity investment results ($33 million), lower interest income ($30 million), and higher interest expense ($18 million). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statements of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2008 through 2027, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $1.7 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: • North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada; • North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada; • International Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada; • Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide; and • Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide under Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club. In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents In addition to the brands noted above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family-friendly resorts and spas, “Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott” and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, “Edition.” At year-end 2007, no properties were yet open under either brand. In 2006, we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and, as part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting. Accordingly, we now report five operating segments, and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments. We reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this report for all periods presented, and present historical figures in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. See also the Form 8-K that we filed on March 19, 2007, furnishing quarterly Revenues and Income from Continuing Operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, indirect general, administrative, and other expenses, or income taxes. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segment’s operations. We also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. “Other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment, and our organizational and management reporting structure. 29 Table of Contents Total Lodging Products by Segment At year-end 2007, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,156 corporate housing rental units): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. Total North American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 309 12 321 121,842 4,556 126,398 Marriott Conference Centers 13 — 13 3,476 — 3,476 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 15 — 15 7,901 — 7,901 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 70 3 73 25,942 1,034 26,976 Renaissance ClubSport 1 — 1 175 — 175 408 15 423 159,336 5,590 164,926 North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 693 16 709 96,759 2,847 99,606 Fairfield Inn 529 7 536 46,930 741 47,671 SpringHill Suites 176 1 177 20,445 124 20,569 Residence Inn 528 17 545 62,805 2,536 65,341 TownePlace Suites 141 — 141 14,122 — 14,122 2,067 41 2,108 241,061 6,248 247,309 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 144 148 2,742 39,396 42,138 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 1 22 23 387 8,244 8,631 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts — 67 67 — 21,783 21,783 Courtyard — 58 58 — 11,174 11,174 Fairfield Inn — 1 1 — 206 206 Residence Inn — 1 1 — 75 75 Marriott Executive Apartments — 18 18 — 2,905 2,905 Ramada International — 2 2 — 332 332 5 313 318 3,129 84,115 87,244 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton 36 34 70 11,627 9,978 21,605 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts — 2 2 — 117 117 The Ritz-Carlton-Residential (2) 16 1 17 1,614 93 1,707 52 37 89 13,241 10,188 23,429 Timeshare Lodging Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 37 9 46 8,987 1,909 10,896 The Ritz-Carlton Club-Fractional 5 2 7 283 105 388 The Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential (2) 2 1 3 138 6 144 Grand Residences by Marriott-Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential (1), (2) 1 — 1 65 — 65 Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club 2 — 2 444 — 444 48 13 61 10,116 2,069 12,185 Total 2,580 419 2,999 426,883 108,210 535,093 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. This ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. 31 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 We added 203 properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units). Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from $1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, as compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees from $1,224 million in 2006 to $1,428 million in 2007, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $7 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007, reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and property-level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 62 percent in 2006. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 7.0 percent. As compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company-operated house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, as compared to 2006, house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis. 2006 Compared to 2005 We added 136 properties (23,466 rooms) and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system in 2006. Most of the properties that left the system were limited-service properties. Total segment financial results increased by $314 million (29 percent) to $1,415 million in 2006 from $1,101 million in 2005, and total segment revenues increased by $857 million to $11,930 million in 2006, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,073 million in 2005. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $197 million (19 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees from $1,027 million in 2005 to $1,224 million in 2006, $124 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $8 million of increased owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $98 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, and an increase in minority interest of $2 million, partially offset by $78 million of lower gains and other income and a $37 million decline in earnings associated with equity investments. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million (40 percent) during 2006, reflecting the impact of strong room rate improvement and property-level margin improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, 32 Table of Contents respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. In 2006, 62 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 51 percent in 2005. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased by 9.1 percent over 2005 and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased by 10.5 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 11.1 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 9.4 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 9.5 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 230 basis points, while North American company-operated house profit margins improved by 240 basis points versus 2005. For 2006, as compared to 2005, HP-PAR at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 16.3 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties increased by 12.6 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 15.4 percent on a constant dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 203 properties, totaling 29,200 rooms, across our brands in 2007 and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units). Highlights of the year included: • Converting 26 properties (5,618 rooms), or 18 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 21 percent of the rooms were located in international markets; • Opening approximately 16 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; • Adding 156 properties (17,517 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; and • Opening two new Marriott Vacation Club properties in the West Indies on the island of St. Kitts, and the U.S. Virgin Islands on the island of St. Thomas, as well as one new Ritz-Carlton Club and residences property in San Francisco, California. We currently have more than 125,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2008. We expect to remove approximately 5,000 rooms from our system during the 2008 full year. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. Statistics. The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2007 include the period from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007, the statistics for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005, through December 29, 2006, and the statistics for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005, through December 30, 2005 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 33 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2007 Change vs. 2006 2007 Change vs. 2006 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 72.6 % 1.0 % pts. 70.8 % 0.6 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 5,476 $ 5,196 $ 5,116 5 % 2 % Segment results $ 478 $ 455 $ 349 5 % 30 % 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92. Occupancy for these properties increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54. The $23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007. Gains and other income was $22 million lower in 2007, as compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straight-line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. The $34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007 reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General, administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged as compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the write-off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system. 2006 Compared to 2005 In 2006, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,971 rooms) and six properties (1,604 rooms) left the system. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased by 8.5 percent to $121.10. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points, and average daily rates increased by 9.0 percent to $167.27. Compared to the prior year, our 2006 results reflect a $59 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, higher food and beverage, meeting room rental and other revenue, and productivity improvements, all of which favorably impacted property-level house profit margins. The growth in the number of rooms, year-over-year, also contributed to the increase in fees. Incentive management fees included $10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized. Similarly, base management fees for 2006 included $4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a $10 million hotel agreement termination fee associated with one property, partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees. 40 Table of Contents General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $69 million as a result of, among other things, a $60 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction, more fully discussed in the previous “Operating Income” discussion, as well as expenses of $14 million in 2005 related to our bedding incentive program, partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. In 2005, general, administrative, and other expenses included $3 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments associated with one property. In 2006, general, administrative, and other expenses included a $5 million hotel management agreement performance cure payment. Gains and other income was $3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties. Gains and other income for 2006 reflected a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease, as further described in the “Expected Land Sale” caption in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our 2006 Form 10-K. Equity results decreased by $19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures’ sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006, offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment. North American Limited-Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 2,198 $ 2,060 $ 1,886 7 % 9 % Segment results $ 461 $ 380 $ 303 21 % 25 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system in 2007. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by 4.8 percent to $89.18. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63. The $81 million increase in segment results, as compared to 2006, primarily reflects an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years’ results but not earned and due until 2007 as compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise fees, and to productivity improvements, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were associated with properties, primarily our Fairfield Inn brand, that left our system and $1 million of similar fees in 2006. The $11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write-off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs. 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 91 properties (11,329 rooms) and 28 properties (3,647 rooms) left the system in 2006. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. 41 Table of Contents In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by 9.1 percent to $84.41. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 73.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 10.4 percent to $115.24. The $77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $77 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, $27 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $6 million of increased equity results, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses and a $19 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Stronger performance at our renovated Courtyard properties, versus nonrenovated properties, also contributed to the increase in segment results over the prior year. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale, late in 2005, of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $11 million associated with our bedding incentive program, a $6 million litigation charge and a $3 million guarantee charge. Improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006, new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. For additional information regarding the Courtyard Joint Venture, see the “Courtyard Joint Venture” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2005 Form 10-K. Gains and other income decreased by $19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture, partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of $4 million in 2006 and increased income of $4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures. International Lodging includes International Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, International Courtyard, International Fairfield Inn, International Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 1,594 $ 1,411 $ 1,017 13 % 39 % Segment results $ 271 $ 237 $ 133 14 % 78 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (4,686 rooms) and 31 properties (4,678 rooms) left the system in 2007. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44. Occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The $34 million increase in segment results in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflects a $27 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006. The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase in gains and other income reflects higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, as compared to the year-ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The $7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006 is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007. 42 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 22 properties (5,242 rooms) and 10 properties (3,136 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 11.1 percent to $114.61. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.2 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 9.4 percent to $153.99. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and certain Middle Eastern countries all had strong RevPAR increases. The $104 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $43 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, $37 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $29 million of increased owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in gains and other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower equity results. Incentive management fees included $10 million and $4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods they were recognized. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Equity results decreased by $20 million in 2006 versus 2005 and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $14 million in equity earnings from a joint venture as a result of the venture’s sale of a hotel and $4 million of increased equity losses in 2006 associated with one joint venture’s hotel that was closed for renovation. The increase of $29 million in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects $19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of $12 million for hotel agreement termination fees for several properties. The $19 million improvement in owned and leased results also reflects the impact of a $5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” as it was not sold within one year of its classification as “held for sale,” as had been expected. The $15 million increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006, partially offset by a decrease in other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a $34 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure. Also impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees and 2006 reflected $7 million of increased expenses related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 1,576 $ 1,423 $ 1,333 11 % 7 % Segment results $ 72 $ 63 $ 45 14 % 40 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (2,529 rooms) and one property (273 rooms) left the system in 2007. In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36. The $9 million increase in segment results, as compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, as compared to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to 43 Table of Contents the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years, the year-over-year favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact associated with the opening of a new leased property in 2007. 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added three properties (424 rooms) and one property (229 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.7 percent to $209.88. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.5 percent to $289.50. The $18 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $16 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements, the growth in the number of rooms, and the recognition of $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $7 million is attributable to a 2005 hotel management agreement performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property, partially offset by a $5 million increase in expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development and an increase in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Gains and other income decreased by $5 million in 2006 as a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property, partially offset by gains totaling $3 million associated with the 2006 sale of a preferred interest in one property. 44 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands.

Timeshare contract sales decreased by 14 percent as compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products. The $225 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues from $1,840 million to $2,065 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal of contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, 45 Table of Contents offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. As compared to the prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflects strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii and start-up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007. 2006 Compared to 2005 Timeshare contract sales increased by 17 percent in 2006. Timeshare segment revenues of $1,840 million and $1,721 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, include $41 million and $38 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. The $119 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues reflects a $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $27 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $2 million of increased base management fees. The $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed earlier in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Segment results of $280 million in 2006 increased by $9 million over 2005. The $9 million increase includes an increase of $98 million for Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses and a $2 million increase in base management fees, partially offset by a decline of $72 million in gains and other income, a $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and $3 million of lower joint venture equity earnings. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $98 million largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. Note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million primarily reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with SOP 04-2, implemented in 2006. Additionally, the $98 million variance reflected a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and $12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense, partially offset by $21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. The $3 million decline in equity income primarily reflects start-up losses associated with several new joint ventures, partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures. The $72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected $69 million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006, while the $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007. We have no remaining exposure related to this historical investment. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase-out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 2, “Discontinued Operations,” and Footnote No. 17, “Contingencies,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 46 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 For 2007, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $5 million in 2006 to a loss of $1 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.71 percent phase-out of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phase-out that was estimated at year-end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. 2006 Compared to 2005 For 2006, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $165 million versus revenue of $421 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $125 million in 2005 to $5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phase-out of tax credits at year-end 2006 due to high oil prices in 2006. Additionally, results in 2006 reflect interest costs of $4 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. Segment results for 2006 also reflect a $5 million charge reflecting the write-down of assets at the Alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at year-end and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location. Distribution Services In 2005, we had income, net of tax, of $1 million associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002. New Accounting Standards FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 of $155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140” We adopted FASB’s FAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value, if practicable. It also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FAS No. 156, of $1 million, net of tax, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on December 30, 2006. See Footnote No. 11, “Asset Securitizations,” for additional information. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums” In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”). EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order to recognize profit under the 47 Table of Contents percentage of completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect the impact of adoption of EITF 06-8 to be material. FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”). This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. In November 2007, the FASB agreed to partially defer the effective date, for one year, of FAS No. 157, for non-financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any financial assets or liabilities at the present time. EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” In December 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”). EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit-sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect EITF 07-6 to have a material impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51” On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a non-controlling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non-controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the 48 Table of Contents parent and its non-controlling interest. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. 49 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and supports our commercial paper program. On May 14, 2007, we amended and restated this facility to increase the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012. The material terms of the amended and restated credit agreement were otherwise unchanged. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. At year-end 2007, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2.151 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion under the credit facility, plus our cash balance of $332 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $96 million, and less $585 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. We issue short-term commercial paper in the United States and in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then-current demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cash from operations $ 778 $ 970 $ 840 Depreciation expense 162 155 156 Amortization expense 35 33 28 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.2 to 1.0 at year-end 2007 and 1.3 to 1.0 at year-end 2006. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x 4.9x 3.9x 50 Table of Contents While our Timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment): ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Timeshare segment development (in excess of) less than cost of sales $ (55 ) $ (83 ) $ 40 New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (559 ) (537 ) (441 ) Note repurchases (30 ) (55 ) (23 ) Financially reportable sales (in excess of) less than closed sales (16 ) 61 (57 ) Note sale gains (81 ) (77 ) (69 ) Note sale proceeds 515 508 399 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 106 96 90 Other cash (outflows) inflows (35 ) (17 ) 26 Net cash outflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (155 ) $ (104 ) $ (35 ) Our ability to sell Timeshare segment notes is dependent upon continued liquidity within the asset-backed and broader structured credit markets. While the recent dislocation in the capital markets has resulted in a general reduction in liquidity for new asset-backed issuances, we believe that demand remains sufficient for our continued sale of Timeshare segment notes, albeit at somewhat less favorable terms. If the liquidity of the markets decreases further, or the underlying quality of any future Timeshare segment notes we originate were to deteriorate, we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales, although we do not expect such deterioration. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $671 million in 2007, $529 million in 2006, and $780 million in 2005 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section’s narrative, are not reflected in these numbers. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. At the end of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. Subsequent to year-end 2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in the joint venture. Concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land from our partner as well. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $37 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $74 million and $37 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $745 million in 2007, $798 million in 2006, and $298 million in 2005. In 2007, we closed on the sales of 13 properties and five joint venture investments. Cash proceeds of $90 million for a parcel of land sold in 2007 are not reflected in the $745 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency. Accordingly, these proceeds impacted the “Other investing activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than “Dispositions.” Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2007, amounted to $75 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled 51 Table of Contents $7 million (which included a current portion of $4 million) at year-end 2007 and $9 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year-end 2006. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $206 million (which included a current portion of $18 million) at year-end 2007 and $268 million (which included a current portion of $32 million) at year-end 2006. In 2007 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $64 million and primarily reflects the repayment or sale of several loans and the reserve against an underperforming loan. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in two joint ventures. Cash outflows of $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures. Cash outflows of $216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (“Whitbread”). For additional information regarding Whitbread see Footnote No. 10, “Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture” in our 2006 Form 10-K. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, from $1,833 million to $2,965 million at year-end 2007, due to the issuance of $346 million (book value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more fully below), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully below), a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million. Debt increased by $96 million in 2006, from $1,737 million to $1,833 million at year-end 2006, due to the issuance of $349 million (book value at issuance) of Series H Senior Notes, partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of $184 million, and other debt decreases of $69 million. In 2007, we issued $350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent Series I Senior Notes due 2017. The offering of the notes closed on June 25, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and commenced on December 15, 2007. The notes will mature on June 15, 2017, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Also in 2007, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.625 percent Series J Senior Notes due 2013. The offering of the notes closed on October 19, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $396 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2008. The notes will mature on February 15, 2013, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Both the Series I Senior Notes and the Series J Senior Notes were issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated as of November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2007, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 6.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.9 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2007. At the end of 2007, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. Subsequent to year-end 2007, on January 15, 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series E Senior Notes. Share Repurchases. We purchased 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share, and 51.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $32.12 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year-end 2007, 33.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 2 percent to $0.0750 per share. 52 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2007: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,855 $ 300 $ 405 $ 596 $ 2,554 Capital lease obligations (1) 12 1 2 2 7 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,394 121 256 219 798 Non-recourse 439 21 30 30 358 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 166 30 60 43 33 Other long-term liabilities 110 3 14 5 88 Total contractual obligations $ 5,976 $ 476 $ 767 $ 895 $ 3,838 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2007 was $132 million and is not reflected in the Contractual Obligations table. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year-end 2007: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 315 $ 21 $ 89 $ 49 $ 156 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 322 46 91 112 73 Total other commercial commitments $ 637 $ 67 $ 180 $ 161 $ 229 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $315 million listed in the preceding table include $41 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable of $322 million in the preceding table include $245 million of guarantees that expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $7 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $77 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of the 2023 calendar year. CTF has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately €7 million [$11 million] remained at year-end 2007). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $77 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. Furthermore, in addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 53 Table of Contents 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. We have also provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $80 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 25 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. The carrying value of the liabilities associated with these two project completion guarantees is $7 million. In addition to the guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2007, we had extended approximately $4 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $2 million within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire after five years. At year-end 2007, we also have commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $14 million in one to two years; and $30 million in three to five years. As of year-end 2007, we also have a commitment to invest up to $25 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $12 million and have $13 million remaining that we expect to fund within one year. As of year-end 2007, we also had a commitment to invest up to $29 million (€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are an investor. We currently do not expect to fund under this commitment. At year-end 2007 we had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year-end 2007 totaled $468 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 54 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $9 million at year-end 2007. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Base management fees $ 56 $ 62 $ 83 Franchise fees 1 2 2 Incentive management fees 26 22 14 Cost reimbursements 510 649 936 Owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue — — 19 Total revenue $ 593 $ 735 $ 1,054 General, administrative, and other $ (4 ) $ (1 ) $ (19 ) Reimbursed costs (510 ) (649 ) (936 ) Gains and other income 25 28 54 Interest expense (1 ) (1 ) — Interest income 4 4 31 (Provision for) reversal of provision for loan losses (12 ) 1 — Equity in earnings 15 3 36 Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) At Year-end2007 At Year-end2006 Current assets-accounts and notes receivable $ 42 $ 76 Deferred development 2 — Contract acquisition costs 33 34 Equity and cost method investments 316 377 Loans to equity method investees 21 27 Long-term deferred tax asset, net 1 4 Current liabilities: Other payables and accruals (2 ) (2 ) Other long-term liabilities (16 ) (13 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: • it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and • changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. 55 Table of Contents Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $92 million. We had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2007 and 2006, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $102 million and $138 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In accordance with the adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, our allowance for credit losses associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” totaled $19 million and $29 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices, and with respect to our synthetic fuel business, changes in oil prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of $55 million at year-end 2007, which we account for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2007, we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold-note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $157 million, and they expire through 2022. • Option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2008. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was approximately $86 million, and they expire throughout 2008. • Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was approximately $58 million, and they expire in 2008 and 2010. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $133 million at year-end 2007. • Oil price hedges to manage the volatility associated with oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase-out of tax credits in 2007. The hedges cover 19 million barrels of oil and expired on December 31, 2007. 58 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year-end 2007: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,178 properties (560,681 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2008 and include 27 home and condominium projects (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,332 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 18 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (Ritz-Carlton-Residential), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. The economic recession, the global credit crisis and eroded consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2008. U.S. lodging demand declined throughout 2008, but especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of slowing economic growth. Outside the United States, international lodging demand was generally stronger in most markets than in the United States, but also softened progressively throughout 2008 and declined markedly in the 2008 fourth quarter. Leisure transient demand in the United States weakened in the first quarter of 2008 and was joined by weakening business transient demand beginning in the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, demand associated with our luxury properties decreased dramatically in the 2008 fourth quarter. These factors were compounded in several markets in the United States where the supply of hotel rooms increased. Last minute new group meeting demand and attendance at group meetings softened considerably throughout 2008 as well, and group meeting cancellations increased significantly in the fourth quarter. While some business customers increased room nights in 2008, including professional services firms, defense contractors, and insurance companies, others declined, including companies associated with the financial services, automotive, and telecommunications industries. In general, for the properties in our system, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand worldwide than our limited-service and luxury properties. U.S. demand for timeshare intervals also softened considerably in 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak consumer confidence and a very difficult financing environment, while demand in Latin America and Asia for timeshare products was stronger compared to 2007. Demand for Ritz-Carlton fractional and residential units was particularly weak. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, soft demand is frequently not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also unfavorably impact nearer-term Timeshare segment results as percentage-of-completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Responding to the challenging demand environment in 2008 for hotel rooms, we initiated a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase property-level revenue. These promotions were designed to keep current customers loyal while also attracting new guests. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we have also implemented sales associate and customer incentives to close on business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with more than 300,000 of our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and through our blog “Marriott on the Move.” We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically market to this large and growing customer base. 24 Table of Contents Given this slower demand environment, we worked aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property-level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, and not filling some vacant positions. While varying by property, most properties in our system have instituted contingency plans with very tight cost controls. We have also reduced the above-property costs by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas that are allocated to the hotels. We have also eliminated certain positions, not filled some vacant positions, and will encourage, and where legally permitted, require employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Additionally, we canceled certain hotel development projects. For our Timeshare segment, we have slowed or canceled some development projects, closed less efficient timeshare sales offices and increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives. For additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts, see our “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” caption later in this section. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2008, 48 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 50 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on property management and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long-term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make, we increase our financial flexibility. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR decreased in 2008, compared to the year-ago period, with moderately greater strength in Manhattan, New York, Houston, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, California and weaker RevPAR in suburban markets near, among other areas, Orange County, California, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. Outside North America, 2008 RevPAR increases versus the prior year period were stronger, particularly in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Compared to 2007, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins for 2008 decreased by 70 basis points reflecting the impact of stronger year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very strong cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system. This impact was more than offset by the impact of RevPAR declines year-over-year associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and higher expenses in 2008 in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest December 31 and while the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years included 52 weeks, the 2008 fiscal year included 53 weeks. As the 53rd week for 2008 included the New Year’s holiday and was seasonally slow, it had the effect of reducing year-over-year RevPAR performance. While worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company-operated properties decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2007, worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company-operated properties excluding the extra 53rd week decreased 0.4 percent compared to 2007. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We have added other languages to Marriott.com and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. 25 Table of Contents See Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2008, 2007, and 2006. Continuing Operations Revenues 2008 Compared to 2007 Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property-level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the “BUSINESS SEGMENTS” discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system. 2007 Compared to 2006 Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized 26 Table of Contents $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in 2007 and $52 million in 2006), offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006. The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million (6 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital-intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and, particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We responded by implementing certain companywide cost-saving measures, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost-saving measures. Upper-level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development, and above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also incurred other charges, including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses, and inventory write-downs on Timeshare inventory, reserves on accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, a charge related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests, a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to Timeshare note sale hedges, and asset impairments and other charges, detailed further in “Other Charges.” As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed down certain operations in Europe. We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, including: (1) $14 million in severance costs; (2) $5 million in facilities exit costs, primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $9 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting $55 million to $65 million ($35 million to $42 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the “Timeshare-direct” and the “General, administrative, and other expenses” captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24 million, including: (1) $2 million in severance costs; and (2) $22 million related to the write-off of 27 Table of Contents capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued, including capitalized costs related to owned development of Renaissance ClubSport. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting up to $6 million ($4 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing above-property level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million primarily reflecting severance costs. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting up to $4 million ($3 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We have provided detailed information related to these restructuring costs and other charges below. Restructuring Costs Severance These various restructuring initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1,021 employees (the majority of whom were terminated by January 2, 2009) across the Company. We recorded a total workforce reduction charge of $19 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits, which consisted of $14 million for the Timeshare segment, $2 million related to hotel development, and $3 million related to above-property level lodging management and corporate overhead. The charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. We also delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. In connection with these initiatives, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million related to severance and fringe benefits in 2009 for the Timeshare segment. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the Timeshare segment restructuring, we ceased using certain leased facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5 million associated with these facilities, primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In connection with these initiatives, in 2009, we expect to incur an additional $2 million to $3 million related to ceasing use of additional noncancelable leases. Development Cancellations We sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties, including legal costs, the cost of land, and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the sharp downturn in the economy, we decided to discontinue certain development projects that required our investment, including our Renaissance ClubSport real estate development activities. These cancellations do not impact the two Renaissance ClubSport properties that are currently open. As a result of these development cancellations, we expensed $31 million of previously capitalized costs, which consisted of $9 million of costs for the Timeshare segment and $22 million of costs related to hotel development. We do not currently expect to expense any additional capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives. Other Charges Charges for Guarantees and Reserves for Loan Losses We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us or, in some cases, to third-party lending institutions. In addition, we expect profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels. As a result, based on cash flow projections, we expect to fund under some of our guarantees, which we do not deem recoverable, and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be repaid according to its original terms. Due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable, we recorded charges of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the expected loan loss, we recorded a charge of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “Provision for loan losses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 28 Table of Contents Timeshare Inventory Write-downs As a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, we recorded an inventory write-down of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We recorded this charge in the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounts Receivable-Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reserved $4 million of accounts receivable, which we deemed uncollectible, generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment, following an analysis of those accounts. We recorded this charge in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances Our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling $12 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for certain projects under the percentage-of-completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these projects, and reflected $7 million of the $12 million in the “Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs, and was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs. Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation The fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests. The increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit markets, which significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers. As a result of this change, we recorded a $32 million charge in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the decrease in the fair value of these residual interests. Timeshare Hedge Ineffectiveness Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets, we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the Company in the near term will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated, and accordingly the sensitivity of a hedge the Company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer significantly corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds. Differences include expected legal structures, modifications to priority of cash flow, and higher costs. The change in terms (inputs) used to determine hedge effectiveness for Timeshare’s note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of $12 million in hedge ineffectiveness. We recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Asset Impairments and Other Charges One project that is in development and in which the Company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing commitments as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the project’s major lender. As a result, based on our analysis of expected future cash flows, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was fully impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in the “Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing, we also recorded write-offs of other assets ($12 million) related to development costs associated with projects we no longer deem probable in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also deemed certain cost method tax investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million for those investments in the “Gains and other income” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. 29 Table of Contents Summary of Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The following table is a summary of the restructuring costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as our remaining liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring initiatives: ($ in millions) TotalCharge Non-CashCharge Cash Paymentsin the 2008Fourth Quarter Restructuring Costsand Other ChargesLiability atJanuary 2, 2009 RestructuringCosts Expectedto be Incurredin 2009 Severance-Timeshare $ 14 $ — $ 3 $ 11 $ 3-4 Facilities exit costs-Timeshare 5 — — 5 2-3 Development cancellations-Timeshare 9 9 — — — Total restructuring costs-Timeshare 28 9 3 16 5-7 Severance-hotel development 2 — — 2 — Development cancellations-hotel development 22 22 — — — Total restructuring costs-hotel development 24 22 — 2 — Severance-above property-level management 3 — 1 2 — Total restructuring costs-above property-level management 3 — 1 2 — Total restructuring costs $ 55 $ 31 $ 4 $ 20 $ 5-7 Reserves for guarantees and loan losses 38 22 — 16 Inventory write-downs 9 9 — — Accounts receivable-bad debts 4 4 — — Contract cancellation allowances 12 12 — — Residual interests valuation 32 32 — — Hedge ineffectiveness 12 12 — — Impairment of investments and other 30 30 — — Total other charges 137 121 — 16 Total restructuring and other charges $ 192 $ 152 $ 4 $ 36 We anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the end of 2009 for the Timeshare segment, by the end of 2009 for hotel development, and by the end of 2009 for above-property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year-end 2010.

The decrease in operating income reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $41 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, and a $15 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of $27 million. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled $89 million. The decline of $261 million (75 percent) from the prior year primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential products, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a $22 million pretax impairment charge ($10 million net of minority interest benefit), start-up costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds, as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. The decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008, compared to the prior year. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $41 million (23 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $21 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, $4 million of lower termination fees, and $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. Partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling $6 million in 2008 associated with one property, compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of $8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.” General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $15 million (2 percent) to $783 million in 2008 from $768 million in 2007. This increase reflected the following items: $44 million of increased expenses associated with, among other things, our unit growth and development, systems improvements, and initiatives to enhance our brands globally; a $16 million charge for certain guarantees; an unfavorable $9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007; $12 million in write-offs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations; $4 million of increased foreign exchange losses; and $4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable. See “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees, development cancellation write-offs, and bad debt reserves. These unfavorable 31 Table of Contents variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of $35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Department of Labor of our employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, 2008 included a $28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to an $11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year, both of which reflected mark-to-market valuations. Of the $15 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $51 million was attributable to our Lodging and Timeshare segments and a decrease of $36 million, reflecting the 2007 ESOP settlement charge, was unallocated. The reasons for the decrease of $58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of $27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding “Revenues” section. 2007 Compared to 2006 Operating income increased by $101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in 2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million. The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property-level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million (13 percent) to $768 million in 2007 from $677 million in 2006. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the IRS and Department of Labor examination of our ESOP feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased legal expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the year-ago period reflected $6 million of guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 compared to 2006 and a $9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required. Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging and Timeshare segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million (2 percent), compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, compared to 2006. The $5 million (3 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.” Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net 32 Table of Contents of direct expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties. Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 28 $ — $ — Gains on sales of real estate and other 14 39 26 Loss on expected land sale — — (37 ) Other note sale/repayment gains — 1 2 Gains on forgiveness of debt — 12 — (Loss)/gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments (1 ) 31 68 (Loss)/income from cost method joint ventures (3 ) 14 15 $ 38 $ 97 $ 74 2008 Compared to 2007 The $28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our Senior Notes we repurchased. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. The $25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our International segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the “2007 Compared to 2006” section below. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Income from cost method joint ventures decreased $17 million to a loss of $3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information). 2007 Compared to 2006 The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 was comprised of $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee, which generated a gain of $25 million. Gains on sales of real estate and other increased $13 million in 2007, and primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate by our International segment in 2007 that did not occur in 2006, partially offset by smaller gains in 2006 that did not occur in 2007. Interest Expense 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest expense decreased by $21 million (11 percent) to $163 million in 2008 compared to $184 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of $13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the ESOP settlement in 2007. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding, lower interest rates on commercial paper, and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. As a result, year-over-year interest expense was lower by $7 million. We also benefitted from a $15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects, and the maturity of our Series E Senior Notes in early 2008 yielding a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year. The write-off of $2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008. These favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by $30 million. 33 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in 2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance, which occurred late in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs); interest totaling $5 million associated with other additional debt; and the write-off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year-ago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased by $1 million (3 percent) to $39 million from $38 million in the prior year. The provision for loan losses increased by $3 million (18 percent) to $20 million from $17 million in the prior year. The increase reflected provisions recorded in 2008 including a $22 million provision on a fully impaired loan (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information) and a $3 million loan loss provision associated with one property. The unfavorable variance associated with the 2008 provisions was mostly offset by favorable variances associated with a $12 million provision recorded in 2007, related to one property, a $5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease, and the reversal of $5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write-off, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report. Our tax provision decreased by $91 million (21 percent) to $350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008, a 2007 charge for a German legislative tax change, and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. This decrease was partially offset by $39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008. The higher 2008 tax rate reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries that is in ongoing discussions with the IRS. 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49 million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings. Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge associated with one property and a $5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write-off, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report. Our tax provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) to $441 million in 2007 from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging and Timeshare segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one-time impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. 34 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2008 Compared to 2007 Equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 was unchanged from earnings of $15 million in 2007 and primarily reflected $14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture, which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains, $10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to start-up costs in the prior year, and $5 million of increased earnings from an international segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008, partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate, an impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development, and a $7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one Timeshare segment joint venture (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances). 2007 Compared to 2006 Equity in earnings increased by $12 million to earnings of $15 million from $3 million in 2006 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii. Minority Interest 2008 Compared to 2007 Minority interest increased by $14 million in 2008 to a $15 million benefit. The minority interest benefit of $15 million is net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling $24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $9 million associated with the losses. Income from Continuing Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Compared to the prior year, income from continuing operations decreased by $338 million (48 percent) to $359 million in 2008, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by $0.77 (44 percent) to $0.98. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year was due to lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($261 million), lower gains and other income ($59 million), lower incentive management fees ($58 million), restructuring costs recorded in 2008 ($55 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($41 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($15 million), and higher provision for loan losses ($3 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were lower income taxes ($91 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($27 million), lower interest expense ($21 million), a higher minority interest benefit ($14 million), and higher interest income ($1 million). 2007 Compared to 2006 Compared to 2006, income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20 million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority interest benefit ($1 million). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and 35 Table of Contents Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statements of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2009 through 2028, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $3.5 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: • North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada; • North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada; • International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada; • Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide (together with adjacent residential projects associated with some Ritz-Carlton hotels), as well as Edition, for which no properties are yet open; and • Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide. In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with our Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segment’s business. Additionally, we allocate other gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and minority interests in income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments. “Other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure. 36 Table of Contents Total Lodging and Timeshare Products by Segment At year-end 2008, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,332 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. Total North American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 317 12 329 124,425 4,558 128,983 Marriott Conference Centers 11 — 11 3,133 — 3,133 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 15 1 16 7,901 221 8,122 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 74 3 77 27,425 1,034 28,459 Renaissance ClubSport 2 — 2 349 — 349 419 16 435 163,233 5,813 169,046 North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 728 16 744 101,743 2,847 104,590 Fairfield Inn 560 8 568 49,678 903 50,581 SpringHill Suites 207 1 208 24,027 124 24,151 Residence Inn 555 17 572 66,252 2,590 68,842 TownePlace Suites 163 — 163 16,328 — 16,328 2,213 42 2,255 258,028 6,464 264,492 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 145 149 2,767 40,851 43,618 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 1 25 26 387 8,987 9,374 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts — 62 62 — 20,581 20,581 Courtyard — 64 64 — 12,668 12,668 Fairfield Inn — 1 1 — 206 206 Residence Inn — 1 1 — 75 75 Marriott Executive Apartments — 20 20 — 3,217 3,217 5 318 323 3,154 86,585 89,739 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton 37 33 70 11,629 10,204 21,833 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts — 2 2 — 117 117 The Ritz-Carlton-Residential (2) 22 1 23 2,176 93 2,269 The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments — 3 3 — 478 478 59 39 98 13,805 10,892 24,697 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 39 10 49 9,282 2,071 11,353 The Ritz-Carlton Club-Fractional 7 3 10 339 117 456 The Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential (2) 2 1 3 138 10 148 Grand Residences by Marriott-Fractional 1 1 2 199 42 241 Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential (1), (2) 1 — 1 65 — 65 Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club 2 — 2 444 — 444 52 15 67 10,467 2,240 12,707 Total 2,748 430 3,178 448,687 111,994 560,681 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

Accordingly, as of year-end 2008, we allocated net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as shown in the following table: Minority Interest ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 North American Full-Service Segment $ — $ — $ 1 International Segment (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Luxury Segment — 1 — Timeshare Segment 25 1 — Total segment minority interest 24 1 — Provision for income taxes (9 ) — — $ 15 $ 1 $ — Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 North American Full-Service Segment $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 North American Limited-Service Segment — 2 — International Segment (2 ) 3 — Luxury Segment (12 ) (4 ) (2 ) Timeshare Segment 11 10 (2 ) Total segment equity in earnings (losses) — 14 (2 ) Other unallocated corporate 15 1 5 $ 15 $ 15 $ 3 38 Table of Contents Our business includes our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies. 2008 Compared to 2007 We added 215 properties (32,842 rooms) and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) exited the system in 2008, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units) in 2008. Total segment financial results decreased by $422 million (27 percent) to $1,166 million in 2008 from $1,588 million in the prior year, and total segment revenues decreased by $92 million to $12,817 million in 2008, a 1 percent decrease from revenues of $12,909 million in 2007. While demand was weaker in 2008 compared to 2007, international and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than luxury and limited-service properties. The decrease in revenues included a $259 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. The results, compared to the year-ago period, reflected a decrease of $261 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $51 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $37 million in gains and other income, $29 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, a decrease of $22 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $14 million of lower equity joint venture results. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $27 million (3 percent) increase in combined base management and franchise fees to $1,086 million in the 2008 period from $1,059 million in 2007 and a $23 million increase in minority interest benefit. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from rate increases in international markets, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Compared to 2007, incentive management fees decreased by $58 million (16 percent) in 2008 and reflected the recognition in 2007 of $17 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower RevPAR, higher property-level wages and benefits costs, and utilities costs, particularly in North America. In 2008, 56 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 67 percent in 2007. In addition, in 2008, 49 percent of our incentive fees were derived from international hotels versus 35 percent in 2007. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 2.7 percent and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties decreased by 2.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 3.6 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 3.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 1.5 percent (0.8 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties decreased by 1.1 percent (0.2 percent using actual dollars). Compared to the year-ago period, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2008 decreased by 70 basis points, reflecting the impact of stronger year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very tight cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year-over-year RevPAR decreases associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and also higher expenses in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. North American company-operated house profit margins declined by 140 basis points reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand and higher operating costs, including those associated with wages and benefits and utilities. For 2008, house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) at our North American managed properties decreased by 5.8 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties decreased by 8.0 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 2.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis. 2007 Compared to 2006 We added 203 properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units) in 2007. 39 Table of Contents Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from $1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees to $1,428 million in 2007 from $1,224 million in 2006, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $7 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007, reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and property-level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 62 percent in 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 7.0 percent (8.8 percent using actual dollars). Compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company-operated house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, compared to 2006, HP-PAR at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 215 properties, totaling 32,842 rooms, across our brands in 2008 and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units). Highlights of the year included: • Converting 31 properties (6,439 rooms), or 19 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 12 percent of those rooms were located in international markets; • Opening approximately 24 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; • Adding 168 properties (19,747 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; and • Opening one new Marriott Vacation Club property in Asia on the island of Phuket, Thailand. We currently have more than 125,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms to our system in 2009. Recent events, including failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies, have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. Accordingly, given the difficult lending environment, the Company, owners or franchisees may decide to reevaluate continuing some of the projects included in the development pipeline. While the company has invested in few of its pipeline projects, possible delays, cancellations, or financial restructurings of projects under development could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties 40 Table of Contents that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised, and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009, the statistics for 2007 include the 52 weeks from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007, and the statistics for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005, through December 29, 2006 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 41 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2008 Change vs. 2007 2008 Change vs. 2007 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 70.5 % -2.1 % pts. 68.0 % -2.5 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Segment revenues $ 5,631 $ 5,476 $ 5,196 3 % 5 % Segment results $ 419 $ 478 $ 455 -12 % 5 % 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,611 rooms) and three properties (493 rooms) left the system. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties decreased by 1.6 percent to $123.98, occupancy decreased by 2.0 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.2 percent to $176.30. The $59 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, primarily reflected a $35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a $25 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $2 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition, in 2007, of business interruption insurance proceeds totaling $12 million associated with Hurricane Katrina and also reflected lower demand and property-level margins in 2008 compared to 2007. The slight increase of $2 million in base management and franchise fees was a product of unit growth and an additional week of sales, mostly offset by lower RevPAR. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable $7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008, $8 million of losses associated with three properties, one of which was a new property that opened in 2008, $5 million of lower contract termination fees received, $2 million of lower land rent income, and an unfavorable $3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,951 million in 2008, compared to $4,782 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92, occupancy increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54. The $23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007. Gains and other income was $22 million lower in 2007, compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straight-line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, compared to 2006. The $34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007 reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and 48 Table of Contents $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General, administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the write-off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,782 million in 2007, compared to $4,527 million in 2006.

The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties decreased by 4.2 percent to $85.83, occupancy decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 69.4 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 0.5 percent to $123.69. The $66 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected $43 million of lower incentive management fees, $14 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $13 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower gains and other income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth, partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees. The $43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins and the recognition, in 2007, of $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007. The $14 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected a $15 million charge related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information). The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system, and $7 million of lower income due to lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,541 million in 2008, compared to $1,470 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by 4.8 percent to $89.18, occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63. The $81 million increase in segment results, compared to 2006, primarily reflected an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. 49 Table of Contents In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years’ results but not earned and due until 2007 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise fees, and to productivity improvements, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system and $1 million of similar fees in 2006. The $11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write-off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,470 million in 2007, compared to $1,423 million in 2006. International Lodging includes International Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, International Courtyard, International Fairfield Inn, International Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 2.6 percent to $131.00, occupancy for these properties decreased by 2.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.0 percent to $180.81. Results for our international operations were favorable across most regions, but weakened progressively throughout 2008 and especially in the fourth quarter. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were strongest in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. The $25 million decrease in segment results in 2008, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected a $32 million decrease in gains and other income, a $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a decrease of $5 million in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by an $18 million increase in incentive management fees and an $11 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained unchanged in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in fees was largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, reflected unit growth and cost control plans, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. The $32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008, compared to 2007, reflected the recognition of gains totaling $9 million in 2008, compared to gains in 2007 of $41 million. The 2007 gains primarily reflected a $10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling $23 million associated with sales of real estate. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development. Joint venture equity results were lower than the prior year by $5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct of expenses remained unchanged and reflected $17 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, which was completely offset by $11 million of stronger results at some properties, $5 million of higher termination fees, and $1 million of higher branding fees. 50 Table of Contents Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $707 million in 2008, compared to $741 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our International Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (4,686 rooms) and 31 properties (4,678 rooms) left the system in 2007, primarily due to quality issues. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and Southeast Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The $34 million increase in segment results in 2007 compared to 2006, reflected a $27 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006. The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase in gains and other income reflected higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, compared to the year-ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The $7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006 is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $741 million in 2007, compared to $635 million in 2006. Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts.

In addition, we added seven residential products (654 units) in 2008. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties decreased by 0.1 percent to $225.87, occupancy for these properties decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 69.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.7 percent to $326.63. The $6 million increase in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected a $7 million increase in base management and incentive management fees and $18 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $8 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, an $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, $1 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information), and a $1 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees over the year-ago period reflected new properties added to the system, partially offset by the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years. The $18 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges of $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” compared to $6 million of depreciation charges for that same property in 2008, as well as expenses totaling $3 million in 2007 associated with opening a new leased property, $10 million of improved results in 2008 associated with two properties, one of which was being renovated in 2007, and $2 million of increased branding fees in 2008. 51 Table of Contents The $8 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected costs associated with unit growth and development as well as bad debt expense related to accounts receivable deemed uncollectible (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information). The $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information). Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2008, compared to $1,307 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (2,529 rooms) and one property (273 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36. The $9 million increase in segment results, compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years, the year-over-year favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact associated with the opening of a new leased property in 2007. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,307 million in 2007, compared to $1,261 million in 2006. 52 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands.

Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $325 million (23 percent) compared to 2007 to $1,076 million from $1,401 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2008, compared to the prior year, reflected a $173 million decrease in timeshare sales, an $83 million decrease in residential sales, and a $69 million decrease in fractional sales. The decrease in timeshare contract sales reflected the impact of projects approaching sellout and significantly lower demand. Sales of residential and fractional units were significantly impacted by weak demand, as well as increased cancellation allowances of $115 million recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage-of-completion method for certain projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information). The $315 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,750 million from $2,065 million reflected a $324 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, and a $1 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008, a $32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests, contract cancellation allowances of $17 million, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, as well as the recognition, in 2007, of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year, and increased services revenue. Timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included 53 Table of Contents $68 million and $50 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $16 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Segment results of $28 million in 2008 decreased by $278 million from $306 million in 2007, and reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $28 million of restructuring costs, and $13 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $24 million higher minority interest benefit and $1 million in higher joint venture equity earnings. The $261 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, increased marketing and sales costs, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, start-up costs in 2008 for newer projects, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, a $9 million impact from inventory write-downs related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, and a $5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information). In addition, development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge. We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million ($10 million net of minority interest benefit) in the 2008 third quarter within the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We made the adjustment in accordance with FAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at year-end 2008. The predominant items we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations, and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year risk-free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent). The $25 million benefit associated with minority interest reflected our joint venture partner’s portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate. The $25 million benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008, representing our joint venture partner’s pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. The $95 million decrease in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected $65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007, mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007, $42 million of lower residual interest accretion, and $6 million of increased financing costs, partially offset by $18 million of increased interest income. Lower note sale gains of $65 million reflected a $12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the $42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a $32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information regarding these charges). In 2008 and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $300 million and $520 million, respectively. The $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year. The $28 million of restructuring costs represented $14 million in severance costs, $9 million in development cancellations, and $5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred). The $13 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits. Joint venture equity earnings increased $1 million and reflected $10 million of start-up losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures, mostly offset by $7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information) and $3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $285 million in 2008, compared to $275 million in 2007. 54 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by 14 percent compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products. The $225 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $2,065 million from $1,840 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal of contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, compared to 2006. Compared to the prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflected strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii and start-up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $275 million in 2007, compared to $229 million in 2006. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Airlines, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our effective tax rate increased significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase-out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, “Discontinued Operations-Synthetic Fuel,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 2008 Compared to 2007 The synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $1 million in 2008 and $352 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment totaled $3 million, net of tax, in 2008, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2007. Income 55 Table of Contents from the Synthetic Fuel segment of $3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits. 2007 Compared to 2006 For 2007, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined to a loss of $1 million in 2007 from income of $5 million in 2006, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.7 percent phase-out of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phase-out that was estimated at year-end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. During 2008 we granted 5.6 million restricted stock units (2.6 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $35 per unit and 3.0 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $26 per unit), 2.7 million Employee SARs (1.8 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13 per right and 0.9 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $10 per right), and 4,000 Non-employee SARs. During that time period, we also granted approximately 218,000 stock options and issued 25,000 deferred stock units. The grants made in August would ordinarily have been made in February 2009, but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for the most senior executives were not accelerated. See Footnote No. 4, “Share-Based Compensation,” later in this report for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums” We adopted the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”) on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 06-8 states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“FAS No. 66”), an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer’s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible. If an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37, including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of FAS No. 66, then the entity should apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of FAS No. 66. Although our adoption of EITF 06-8 had no impact on our wholly owned projects in conjunction with the adoption of EITF 06-8 by one joint venture in which we are a partner, we recorded the cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8 as a reduction of $5 million to our investment in that joint venture, an increase in deferred tax assets of $2 million, and a reduction of $3 million to the opening balance of our retained earnings. The application of the continuing investment criterion in EITF 06-8 on the collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability, or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner, to recognize revenues and costs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” We adopted FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of fiscal year 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which amends FAS No. 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, beginning on December 29, 2007, 56 Table of Contents this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. On January 3, 2009, the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. See Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for additional information. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which are measured using Level 3 inputs (which are described in Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements”) in the FAS No. 157 hierarchy, accounted for 94 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year-end 2008, that are required to be measured at fair value using the guidance found in FAS No. 157. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of our residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. The implementation of FAS No. 157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The discount rates we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained. We adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and credit spreads in the market vary. During 2008, we used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and servicing assets. The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates, and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occur at a faster pace than we have projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are higher than we expect, the carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the retained interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, as of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $221 million as of year-end 2008. 57 Table of Contents Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would have the following impact on the valuation of our residual interests at the end of 2008: Decrease in Year-End Valuation($ in millions) PercentageDecrease 100 basis point increase in the prepayment rate $ 3 1.3% 200 basis point increase in the prepayment rate 6 2.6% 100 basis point increase in the discount rate 4 2.0% 200 basis point increase in the discount rate 9 3.9% Two month decline in the weighted average remaining term 2 0.8% Four month decline in the weighted average remaining term 4 1.7% We value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade prices. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, which are recorded within the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” We adopted FAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard permits but does not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008. EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” We adopted EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years 2008 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF 07-6 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FASB Staff Position FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities” We adopted FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities” in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 amends FAS No. 140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors’ continuing involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public enterprises, including sponsors that have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. The FSP also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying special-purpose entity (“SPE”) that holds a variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and a servicer of a qualifying SPE that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for year-end 2008 disclosures. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets’” We adopted FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,’” (“FSP EITF 99-20-1”) in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP EITF 99-20-1 amends EITF Issue No. 99-20 to align the impairment guidance in EITF Issue 58 Table of Contents No. 99-20 with that of FAS No. 115. FAS No. 115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. Our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Therefore, the adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs will no longer be included in the measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs will be expensed as they are incurred. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51” On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. FAS No. 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS No. 161”). FAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial reporting. Under FAS No. 161, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS No. 133”), and its related interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No. 161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FAS No. 133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 161 will have on our financial statements. 59 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties. Events over the past several months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial services companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and has supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility provides for $2.5 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time, and expires on May 14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits the Company’s maximum leverage (defined in the credit agreement as Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including being well within the limits under the Credit Facility leverage covenant, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to increase our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels should we need to do so in the future. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (“LCPI”), a subsidiary of Lehmann Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy on October 5, 2008, is one of the lenders under the Credit Facility, with a total aggregate funding commitment of $96 million (3.8 percent) of the $2.5 billion in total commitments. LCPI did not fund its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the Credit Facility, and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the future. Accordingly, the total current effective size of the Credit Facility is approximately $2.4 billion. The loss of $96 million in effective capacity is not material to us, and the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year-end 2008, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.443 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.404 billion under our Credit Facility, and our cash balance of $134 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $126 million, and less Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of $969 million. We anticipate that this available capacity is adequate to fund our liquidity needs as noted above. In addition, as noted previously, we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, and accordingly expect undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility to remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate considerably more than we anticipate. Until early in the 2008 fourth quarter, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then-current demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers. Disruptions in the financial markets in September 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market. Accordingly, in September 2008 we borrowed under the Credit Facility to fund anticipated short-term commercial paper maturities and, to a lesser extent, other general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and suspended issuing commercial paper. All of our previously issued commercial paper has matured and been repaid. We anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. Fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. 60 Table of Contents In November 2008 Standard & Poor’s changed the outlook on our BBB credit rating to “negative,” which resulted in an automatic downgrade in our commercial paper rating from A2 to A3. The market for A3 commercial paper is currently very limited. This limited availability, together with the higher interest costs associated with A3 issuances, currently makes it difficult and expensive for us to access the commercial paper market. Any future downgrades of our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital. We cannot assure you that downgrades will not occur in the future. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash from operations $ 641 $ 778 $ 970 Depreciation expense 155 162 155 Amortization expense 35 35 33 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.3 to 1.0 at year-end 2008 and 1.2 to 1.0 at year-end 2007. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x 4.9x In response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected capital expenditures for 2009. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). As discussed in the second and third paragraphs following the table, the turmoil in the credit markets hurt the asset securitization market in 2008. Accordingly, we completed only one note sale transaction in 2008, compared with two such transactions in each of 2006 and 2007, and accordingly, note sale proceeds and note sale gains were both significantly lower in 2008 than in the prior two years. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Timeshare segment development in excess of cost of sales $ (299 ) $ (55 ) $ (83 ) New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (525 ) (559 ) (537 ) Note repurchases (56 ) (30 ) (55 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 126 (16 ) 61 Note sale gains (16 ) (81 ) (77 ) Note sale proceeds 237 515 508 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 102 106 96 Other cash inflows (outflows) 33 (35 ) (17 ) Net cash outflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (398 ) $ (155 ) $ (104 ) In June 2008, prior to the end of our second quarter, we sold to a newly formed trust $300 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. On the same day, the trust issued $246 million of the trust’s notes. In connection with the sale of notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million. We retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of $93 million. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on our experience 61 Table of Contents with Timeshare segment notes receivable that we originate. We recorded note sale gains totaling $16 million in 2008, which was net of a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness. Less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets have reduced our gain from Timeshare segment note sales during the past year, as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes have had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and, in the second quarter 2008 transaction, we retained a larger residual interest in the trust. For example, in the 2008 second quarter note sale, the trust that purchased our mortgage notes issued AAA rated asset backed notes at a spread of 325 basis points over the 3.935 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR, compared to AAA note spreads of 100 basis points over the 4.782 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale and 30 basis points over the 5.192 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 second quarter note sale. In addition, while the trusts in the fourth and second quarter 2007 securitizations each also issued 15.5 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at less than AAA ratings, we believed that the market for lower rated notes during the second quarter of 2008 was insufficient to permit issuance of AA, A, and BBB+ rated notes at attractive spreads. Accordingly, we decided to retain a larger residual interest in the trust for the second quarter 2008 transaction rather than having the trust offer lower rated notes. Given the further deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to postpone our planned note sale until 2009. As of the date this annual report on Form 10-K is filed, the securitization market remains extremely uncertain, and very limited current demand for securitized loans makes that market much more difficult to access than it has been in the past. We believe, nonetheless, that alternatives remain available to us to sell our timeshare notes, record note sale gains, and thereby reduce our timeshare notes receivable balances and improve our cash flow. However, we expect any transaction that we may be able to complete in the near term will be more costly to us, and result in lower note sale gains, if any, relative to the size of the transaction, than those we have experienced in previous years. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $357 million in 2008, $671 million in 2007, and $529 million in 2006 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures decreased primarily due to a reduction in development spending. We expect that near-term capital expenditures will be lower than 2008 levels. See the discussion of “Development and Financing Risks” within the Risk Factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $38 million in 2008, $745 million in 2007, and $798 million in 2006. In 2008, we closed on the sales of two properties, two land parcels, and an interest in an entity that leases four hotels. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2008 and 2007, amounted to net loan advances of $17 million in 2008 and net loan collections and sales of $75 million in 2007. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $2 million, all of which was long-term, at year-end 2008 and $7 million (which included a current portion of $4 million) at year-end 2007. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $236 million (which included a current portion of $15 million) at year-end 2008 and $206 million (which included a current portion of $17 million) at year-end 2007. In 2008, our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, increased by $25 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserve against one loan. 62 Table of Contents Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $25 million in 2008, $40 million in 2007, and $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $130 million in 2008, to $3,095 million at year-end 2008 from $2,965 million, and reflected $969 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of $585 million, the repayment, upon maturity, of $91 million of Series E Senior Notes in the 2008 first quarter, repurchase of $109 million of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $54 million. Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, to $2,965 million at year-end 2007 from $1,833 million, due to the issuance of $346 million (book value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K), a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2008, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 4.8 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2008. At the end of 2008, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s. See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional information on our Credit Facility. In 2008, we repurchased, in the open market, $109 million of our Senior Notes, across multiple series. The debt extinguishment resulted in a gain of $28 million that was recorded for the difference between the purchase price of $77 million and the respective carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We purchased 11.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share, 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, and 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of year-end 2008, 21.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We do not expect share repurchase activity in 2009. Dividends. In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 17 percent to $0.0875 per share. Dividends of $115 million were paid in 2008, a 10 percent increase over 2007. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2008: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,815 $ 238 $ 305 $ 1,910 $ 1,362 Capital lease obligations (1) 11 1 2 2 6 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,335 137 248 212 738 Non-recourse 382 16 29 28 309 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 131 29 54 25 23 Other long-term liabilities 104 — 2 6 96 Total contractual obligations $ 5,778 $ 421 $ 640 $ 2,183 $ 2,534 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. 63 Table of Contents The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $141 million and $132 million, respectively, and is not reflected in the Contractual Obligations table. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. It is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period, but we do not anticipate that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year-end 2008: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 298 $ — $ 75 $ 65 $ 158 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 273 — 57 119 97 Total other commercial commitments $ 571 $ — $ 132 $ 184 $ 255 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $298 million listed in the preceding table include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, along with $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying debt has been funded. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include $206 million of guarantees that we anticipate will expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $145 million and lifecare bonds of $61 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and $9 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of $50 million of the lifecare bonds. Five Star is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, according to recent SEC filings made by Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrise’s financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrise’s continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $67 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2023. CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”) had originally made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately €7 million [$10 million] remained at year-end 2008). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $67 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $6 million. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $460 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. 64 Table of Contents In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2008, we had extended approximately $10 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $8 million, which expire within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire in one year. At year-end 2008, we also had commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $34 million within three years; and $10 million after three years. Of the $44 million in commitments, we expect to fund $29 million within one to two years and $15 million within three years. In addition, as of year-end 2008, we had commitments, with no expiration date, to fund up to $25 million in joint ventures for development of new properties of which we expect to fund $13 million within one year and $12 million in one to two years. Also, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $8 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $1 million and have $7 million remaining that we do not expect to fund. And, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment to invest up to $28 million (€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to fund under this commitment. At year-end 2008, we had $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2008 totaled $465 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $3 million at year-end 2008. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Base management fees $ 49 $ 56 $ 62 Franchise fees — 1 2 Incentive management fees 11 26 22 Cost reimbursements 340 510 649 Total revenue $ 400 $ 593 $ 735 General, administrative, and other $ (1 ) $ (4 ) $ (1 ) Reimbursed costs (340 ) (510 ) (649 ) Gains and other income 12 25 28 Interest expense 4 1 1 Interest income 3 4 4 (Provision for) reversal of provision for loan losses — (12 ) 1 Equity in earnings 15 15 3 Provision for income taxes 1 — — 65 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) At Year-End2008 At Year-End2007 Current assets-accounts and notes receivable $ 23 $ 42 Deferred development 3 2 Contract acquisition costs 28 33 Equity and cost method investments 309 316 Loans to equity method investees 50 21 Other long-term receivables 7 — Long-term deferred tax assets, net — 1 Current liabilities: Other payables and accruals (9 ) (2 ) Other long-term liabilities (15 ) (16 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: • it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and • changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections, which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than its estimated fair value. 66 Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections that may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. When we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2008, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving $44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2008 and 2007, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $135 million and $102 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In accordance with the adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 to the current year. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, our allowance for credit losses associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” totaled $35 million and $19 million, respectively. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 67 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities. We are also subject to risk from changes in equity prices from an investment in common stock, which has a carrying value of $10 million at year-end 2008, which we account for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2008, we were party to the following derivative instruments: • An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. • Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $111 million, and they expire through 2022. • Two interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was $149 million at year-end 2008, and they expire in 2012. • Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was approximately $89 million, and they expire in 2009 and 2010. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $190 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2009. • Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the investments remaining at year-end 2008 was $15 million and they expire in 2009. 68 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year-end 2008: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,420 properties (595,461 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2009 and include 30 home and condominium products (3,034 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,072 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Lodging Weak economic conditions in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world, instability in the financial markets following the worldwide financial crisis that began in 2008, and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009. Lodging demand in the United States, as well as internationally, remained soft throughout 2009, as a result of weak economic conditions, while hotel room supply increased in several markets. Demand for our luxury properties remained particularly weak. Outside the United States, concerns in the latter half of 2009 regarding the H1N1 virus also hurt demand, particularly in Mexico, as well as in some markets in Asia, the Caribbean and South America. We experienced continued weakness in 2009 associated with both group and business transient demand. New group meeting cancellations moderated progressively throughout 2009 as compared to the 2008 fourth quarter. New near-term group bookings remain soft, although they improved somewhat, particularly in the 2009 fourth quarter. While we continued to experience significant attrition rates in 2009 from expected attendance at meetings, that moderated somewhat in the latter half of 2009. Non-corporate demand, which remained weak in the 2009 first quarter, improved in the 2009 second quarter and even more so in the 2009 third and fourth quarters, largely as a result of significant promotional efforts and discounting aimed at replacing weak corporate business with leisure, government, and other discounted transient business. Through these challenging times, our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by driving revenue, increasing our market share and managing costs. Responding to the weak demand environment for hotel rooms, we continue to deploy a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase both property-level revenue and market share. We monitor market conditions continuously and are able to quickly institute high impact and low cost sales promotions as needed. These promotions are designed both to reward and retain loyal customers and to attract new guests. www.Marriott.com and our loyal Marriott Rewards member base are both low cost and high impact vehicles for our revenue generation efforts. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we also implemented sales associate, meeting planner, and customer incentives to close on new group business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and through our blog “Marriott on the Move.” We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. With a goal of continuing to improve the overall guest service experience, we improved www.Marriott.com in 2009 by redesigning the website to significantly enhance its functionality and modernize its appearance. 25 Table of Contents Properties in our system instituted and are maintaining very tight cost controls. Given the current weak demand environment, we continue to work aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property-level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, relaxing some brand standards for hotels, cross-training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, eliminating certain positions, and not filling some vacant positions. We have also reduced above-property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have eliminated or not filled certain above-property positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2009, 46 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 52 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long-term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, we maintain financial flexibility by minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable company-operated properties, RevPAR decreased by 18.5 percent in 2009, compared to 2008, reflecting weakness in most markets. Our 2009 fiscal year began on January 3, 2009, and included 52 weeks while the prior year included 53 weeks and two New Year’s holidays. If RevPAR for 2008 was calculated for the 52 week period ended January 2, 2009, RevPAR would have declined by an average of 19.3 percent for our North American comparable company-operated properties. For our comparable managed properties outside North America, RevPAR for 2009 decreased 18.0 percent versus 2008, with weakness in most markets around the world. Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins for 2009 decreased by 380 basis points reflecting the impact of RevPAR declines from weak demand, partially offset by strong cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system. Timeshare Weak economic conditions, instability in the financial markets, and low consumer confidence also kept demand for timeshare intervals soft in 2009. Demand for fractional and residential units was particularly weak. As a result, we slowed or canceled some development projects and closed less efficient timeshare sales offices in 2008 and 2009. We also increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives and eliminated or did not fill certain positions in 2008 and 2009. During the 2009 second and third quarters, we were able to increase sales over the 2009 first quarter through various sales promotions, including pricing adjustments. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties have instituted very tight cost controls, and we have eliminated or not filled certain positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. For additional information on our company-wide restructuring efforts, see our “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” caption later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segment’s businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare segment portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. These decisions resulted in our recording 2009 third quarter pretax charges totaling $752 million ($502 million after-tax). We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. 26 Table of Contents Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, soft demand frequently is not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also reduce nearer-term Timeshare segment results as percentage-of-completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use website, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary website, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We have added other languages to www.Marriott.com, and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. See the “Risk Factors” section of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2009, 2008, and 2007. Continuing Operations Revenues 2009 Compared to 2008 Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and service revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property-level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner. With particularly weak demand and low property-level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system. 27 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property-level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the “BUSINESS SEGMENTS” discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system. Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segment’s timeshare, luxury residential, and luxury fractional real estate development businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to take the following actions: (1) for our luxury residential projects, reduce prices, convert certain proposed projects to other uses, sell some undeveloped land, and not pursue further Marriott-funded residential development projects; (2) reduce prices for existing luxury fractional units; (3) continue short-term promotions for our U.S. timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases; and (4) for our European timeshare and fractional resorts, continue promotional pricing and marketing incentives and not pursue further development. We designed these plans, which primarily relate to luxury residential and fractional resorts, to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. As a result of these decisions, in 2009, we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income ($502 million after-tax), including $614 million of pretax charges impacting operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption, and $138 million of pretax charges impacting non-operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non-cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments that we expected to fund in 2010. 28 Table of Contents The following table details the composition of these charges. ($ in millions) Impairment Charge 2009 Operating Income Charge Inventory impairment $ 529 Property and equipment impairment 64 Other impairments 21 Total operating income charge 614 2009 Non-Operating Income Charge Joint venture impairment 71 Loan impairment 40 Funding liability 27 Total non-operating income charge 138 Total $ 752 For additional information related to these impairment charges, including how these impairments were determined and the impairment charges grouped by product type and/or geographic location, see Footnote No. 20, “Timeshare Strategy – Impairment Charges.” Restructuring Costs and Other Charges During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 (although we did complete a note sale in the first quarter of 2009). These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we put certain company-wide cost-saving measures in place in response to these declines, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost-saving measures. Upper-level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, lodging development, and above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recorded $137 million of other charges in the 2008 fourth quarter. For information regarding the fourth quarter 2008 charges, see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2008 (“2008 Form 10-K”). Restructuring Costs As part of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel development, above-property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on these restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, a roll forward of the restructuring liability, and cumulative restructuring costs to date since inception of the restructuring, please see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.” As a result of our Timeshare segment’s restructuring efforts, we are projecting $112 million to $117 million ($68 million to $72 million after-tax) of annual cost savings in 2010. In 2009 we realized approximately $80 million to $85 million ($48 million to $52 million after-tax) compared to the $70 million to $80 million we had projected for 2009. The 2009 savings primarily were, and we expect that future savings will primarily be, reflected in the “Timeshare-direct” and the “General, administrative, and other” expense captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we are projecting approximately $12 million ($7 million after-tax) of annual cost savings in 2010. In 2009, we realized $9 million ($5 million after-tax) of savings. The 2009 savings primarily were, and we expect that future savings will primarily be, reflected in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The restructuring initiatives we implemented by reducing above property-level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead are projected to result in $10 million to $11 million ($6 million to $7 million after-tax) of annual cost savings in 2010, and in 2009 we realized all of the $8 million ($5 million after-tax) of savings we had projected for 2009. These savings primarily were, and are expected to be, reflected in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 29 Table of Contents We anticipate that the remaining restructuring liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the third quarter of 2010 for the Timeshare segment and by the fourth quarter of 2010 for hotel development and for above-property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2014. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year-end 2010. Other Charges We also incurred $162 million of other charges in 2009, which include $100 million recorded in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption, a net $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services, net of direct expenses and $39 million of joint venture impairments recorded in the “Equity in (losses) earnings” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. The charges recorded in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption include: (1) $49 million security deposit impairment; (2) $43 million in loan impairments now classified in “General, administrative and other”; (3) $11 million reversal of the related expected funding liability; (4) $4 million of accounts receivable and guarantee charges; (5) $7 million software development write-off; and (6) $8 million other asset impairment to write-off contract acquisition costs related to one property. The charges recorded in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption and Timeshare sales and services, net of direct expenses include: (1) $20 million in charges related to residual interest valuation; and (2) net contract cancellation allowances of $3 million. For a detailed discussion of these charges, as well as a table summarizing them by type, please see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.” Also, for segment discussion of these charges, see the “Business Segments” caption that follows. Operating Income 2009 Compared to 2008 Operating income decreased by $917 million (120 percent) to an operating loss of $152 million in 2009 from operating income of $765 million in 2008. The decrease in operating income reflected Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2009 of $614 million, $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees, $69 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of $4 million. In the preceding “Revenues” section, we note the reasons for the decrease of $157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of $156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled $83 million. The decline of $6 million (7 percent) from $89 million in 2008 primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write-down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. Higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note sale gains, increased residual interest accretion, a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests, and a decrease in the cost of financing, partially offset by lower interest income. Lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this section for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $69 million (50 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of $65 million in revenue, net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties, as well as our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated, during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $81 million (10 percent) to $722 million in 2009 from $803 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflected $186 million of lower expenses, largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a $12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008. Additionally, in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment and recorded a $3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption on our Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional 30 Table of Contents information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2008 Form 10-K. These benefits were partially offset by the following items: $49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls; 2009 provisions for loan losses of $43 million for two loans partially offset by a $22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan, (as discussed in Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” these provisions for loan losses are now part of “General, administrative and other”); an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property; a $7 million write-off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; $12 million of expenses primarily related to write-offs of other assets that we deemed non-recoverable, performance cure accruals, and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. Additionally, 2009 included a $15 million unfavorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to a $28 million favorable impact in 2008, both of which reflected mark-to-market valuations. Of the $81 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, $1 million increase was attributable to our Lodging segments, $31 million decrease was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and $51 million decrease was unallocated. 2008 Compared to 2007 Operating income decreased by $418 million (35 percent) to $765 million in 2008 from $1,183 million in 2007. The decrease in operating income reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $41 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, and a $30 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of $27 million. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled $89 million. The decline of $261 million (75 percent) from the prior year primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential products, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a $22 million pretax impairment charge ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit), start-up costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds, as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. The decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008, compared to the prior year. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $41 million (23 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $21 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, $4 million of lower termination fees, and $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. Partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling $6 million in 2008 associated with one property, compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of $8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.” General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $30 million (4 percent) to $803 million in 2008 from $773 million in 2007. This increase reflected the following items: $44 million of increased expenses associated with, among other things, our unit growth and development, systems improvements, and initiatives to enhance our brands globally; a $16 million charge for certain guarantees; an unfavorable $9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007; $12 million in write-offs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations; $4 million of increased foreign exchange losses; $4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable; and a $15 million increase in provision for loan losses, reflecting a $22 million 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information) and a $3 million loan loss provision associated with one property, partially offset by favorable variances associated with a $5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease and the reversal of $5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid (as discussed in Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” those provisions for loan losses are now part of “General, administrative and other”). See “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees, development cancellation write-offs, bad debt reserves, and provision for loan losses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of $35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of 31 Table of Contents issues raised during the examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Department of Labor of our employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, 2008 included a $28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to an $11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year, both of which reflected mark-to-market valuations. Of the $30 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $38 million was attributable to our Lodging segments, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and a decrease of $21 million, primarily reflecting the 2007 ESOP settlement charge, was unallocated. The reasons for the decrease of $58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of $27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding “Revenues” section. Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 21 $ 28 $ — Gains on sales of real estate and other 10 14 39 Other note sale/repayment gains — — 1 Gains on forgiveness of debt — — 12 Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments 3 (1 ) 31 Income/(loss) from cost method joint ventures 2 (3 ) 14 Impairment of equity securities (5 ) — — $ 31 $ 38 $ 97 2009 Compared to 2008 The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements.” 2008 Compared to 2007 The $28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our Senior Notes we repurchased. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. The $25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our International segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the “2007 Compared to 2006” section in our 2008 Form 10-K. Gain on sale of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Income from cost method joint ventures decreased $17 million to a loss of $3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information). Interest Expense 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest expense decreased by $45 million (28 percent) to $118 million in 2009 compared to $163 million in 2008. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (our “Credit Facility”) decreased by $25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. We also benefited from a $26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, and the repurchase of some of our Senior Notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this section for additional information), which resulted in a $12 million reduction to interest expense, and finally, other interest expense decreases of $5 million. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a $23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects. 32 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest expense decreased by $21 million (11 percent) to $163 million in 2008 compared to $184 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of $13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the ESOP settlement in 2007. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding, lower interest rates on commercial paper, and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. As a result, year-over-year interest expense was lower by $7 million. We also benefited from a $15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners as a result of lower interest rates, a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects, and the maturity of our Series E Senior Notes in early 2008 yielding a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year. The write-off of $2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008. These favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by $30 million. Interest Income and Income Tax 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest income decreased by $14 million (36 percent) to $25 million in 2009, from $39 million in 2008, primarily reflecting $8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009. The decline in interest income also reflected $5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances, $2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008, and $2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan, partially offset by $4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at year-end 2008 and in 2009. As noted earlier in the “Operating Income” discussion, we now classify the 2009 and 2008 provisions for loan losses as “General, administrative, and other” expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our tax provision decreased by $415 million (119 percent) to a benefit of $65 million in 2009 from a provision of $350 million in 2008, reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and $43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan. The decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of foreign income in jurisdictions with low tax rates. The 2009 tax rate also reflected $52 million of income tax expense, primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries, an issue that is the subject of ongoing discussions between us and the IRS. The charges recorded in 2009 primarily relate to our ongoing current fiscal year exposure related to this issue. In addition to tax expense on pretax earnings, tax expense for 2008 also reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries. 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest income increased by $1 million (3 percent) to $39 million from $38 million in the prior year. As noted earlier in the “Operating Income” discussion and later in Footnote No. 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” we now classify the 2008 provision for loan losses and $5 million of the $17 million 2007 provision for loan losses as “General, administrative, and other” expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also now classify the remaining $12 million of the 2007 provision for loan losses as “Equity in (losses) earnings” in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as discussed under that caption later in this section. Our tax provision decreased by $91 million (21 percent) to $350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008, a 2007 charge for a German legislative tax change, and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. This decrease was partially offset by $39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008. The higher 2008 tax rate reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries. 33 Table of Contents Equity in (Losses) Earnings 2009 Compared to 2008 Equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 increased by $81 million from equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information). The decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to $15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains, and $5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture. Further contributing to the decline were $24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a Timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project, $7 million of equity losses associated with a North American Limited-Service segment joint venture, a $3 million impairment and $2 million of other equity losses associated with an International segment joint venture, and $9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures, all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment. The unfavorable impacts also included a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development. See the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information on some of these joint venture impairments. 2008 Compared to 2007 Equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 decreased $12 million from earnings of $3 million in 2007 and primarily reflected $14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture, which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains, $10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to start-up costs in the prior year, and $5 million of increased earnings from an International segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008, partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate, an impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development, and a $7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one Timeshare segment joint venture (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances). In 2007, we also recorded a $12 million loan loss provision related to one property where we have a joint venture investment that is not allocated to one of our segments, which as discussed in Footnote No. 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” we now classify under the “Equity in (losses) earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2009 Compared to 2008 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $8 million in 2009 to $7 million, compared to $15 million in 2008. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $14 million in 2008 to $15 million. The benefits for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2008 of $15 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling $24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $9 million associated with the losses. (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 Compared to the prior year, loss from continuing operations increased by $697 million (203 percent) to a 2009 loss of $353 million from 2008 income of $344 million, loss from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $705 million (196 percent) to a 2009 loss of $346 million from 2008 income of $359 million, and diluted losses per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $1.94 (200 percent) to $0.97 per share from earnings of $0.97 per share. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the $697 million increase in loss from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges ($752 million), lower incentive management fees ($157 million), lower base management and franchise fees ($156 million), lower equity in earnings ($81 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other 34 Table of Contents revenue net of direct expenses ($69 million), lower interest income ($14 million), lower gains and other income ($7 million), and lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($6 million). Lower income taxes ($415 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million), lower interest expense ($45 million), and lower restructuring costs ($4 million) partially offset the unfavorable variances. 2008 Compared to 2007 Compared to the prior year, income from continuing operations decreased by $352 million (51 percent) to $344 million in 2008, income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $338 million (48 percent) to $359 million in 2008, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott decreased by $0.76 (44 percent) to $0.97. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease in income from continuing operations versus the prior year was due to lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($261 million), lower gains and other income ($59 million), lower incentive management fees ($58 million), restructuring costs recorded in 2008 ($55 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($41 million), and higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($30 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were lower income taxes ($91 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($27 million), lower interest expense ($21 million), higher equity in earnings ($12 million), and higher interest income ($1 million). Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. In 2007, we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. See Footnote No. 19, “Business Segments” for further information on: (1) our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, and other information about each segment, including: revenues; (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott; net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests; and equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees; (2) revenues, financial results, and fixed assets associated with operations outside the United States; and (3) selling expenses. 35 Table of Contents At year-end 2009, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,072 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. Total North American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 322 13 335 125,863 4,837 130,700 Marriott Conference Centers 11 — 11 3,243 — 3,243 JW Marriott 15 1 16 7,902 221 8,123 Renaissance Hotels 77 2 79 28,569 786 29,355 Renaissance ClubSport 2 — 2 349 — 349 427 16 443 165,926 5,844 171,770 North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 768 16 784 107,640 2,847 110,487 Fairfield Inn & Suites 620 8 628 55,622 903 56,525 SpringHill Suites 255 1 256 29,846 124 29,970 Residence Inn 591 16 607 70,995 2,308 73,303 TownePlace Suites 184 — 184 18,451 — 18,451 2,418 41 2,459 282,554 6,182 288,736 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 152 156 2,765 43,584 46,349 JW Marriott 1 26 27 387 9,953 10,340 Renaissance Hotels — 62 62 — 20,878 20,878 Courtyard — 74 74 — 14,719 14,719 Fairfield Inn & Suites — 1 1 — 206 206 Residence Inn — 1 1 — 109 109 Marriott Executive Apartments — 23 23 — 3,880 3,880 5 339 344 3,152 93,329 96,481 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton 40 34 74 12,115 10,171 22,286 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts — 2 2 — 117 117 The Ritz-Carlton-Residential (2) 25 1 26 2,613 93 2,706 The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments — 3 3 — 474 474 65 40 105 14,728 10,855 25,583 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 41 11 52 9,728 2,126 11,854 The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club 7 2 9 339 122 461 The Ritz-Carlton Residences (2) 3 1 4 222 15 237 Grand Residences by Marriott-Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential (1), (2) 2 — 2 91 — 91 54 15 69 10,579 2,312 12,891 Total 2,969 451 3,420 476,939 118,522 595,461 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

Products in active sales may not be ready for occupancy. 36 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 We added 254 properties (37,714 rooms) and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) exited the system in 2009, not including residential products. We also added 5 residential properties (568 units) in 2009. Total segment financial results decreased by $1,162 million (100 percent) to $4 million in 2009 from $1,166 million in 2008, and total segment revenues decreased by $1,986 million to $10,831 million in 2009, a 15 percent decrease from total segment revenues of $12,817 million in 2008. As discussed in more detail earlier in this report, demand was weaker in 2009 than 2008. The decrease in revenues included a $1,152 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2008, reflected $685 million of Timeshare impairment charges ($614 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption and $71 million of which we reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” section for more information on the impairments), $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined 2009 base management and franchise fees, $85 million of owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $63 million of lower equity joint venture results, $18 million of higher restructuring costs, a $13 million decrease in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interests benefit, a decrease of $9 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $6 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $30 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses. As discussed in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section, these decreases included $80 million in other charges, with $57 million recorded in general, administrative, and other expenses and $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. The $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR in 2009. Incentive management fees decreased by $157 million and reflected lower property-level operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand, somewhat offset by property-level cost controls. With lower property-level operating income, many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and, as a result, we earned no incentive fees from those properties. In 2009, 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside North America versus 49 percent in 2008. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 17.2 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties decreased by 18.5 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties decreased by 17.9 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties decreased by 18.0 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 17.3 percent (18.4 percent using actual dollars) and worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties decreased by 18.3 percent (20.0 percent using actual dollars). Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2009 decreased by 380 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) decreased by 25.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of very tight cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year-over-year RevPAR decreases. International company-operated house profit margins declined by 270 basis points, and HP-PAR at our International managed properties decreased by 22.0 percent reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. North American company-operated house profit margins declined by 440 basis points, and HP-PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 27.7 percent also reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties decreased by 28.7 percent, reflecting cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. 2008 Compared to 2007 We added 215 properties (32,842 rooms) and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) exited the system in 2008, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units) in 2008. Total segment financial results decreased by $422 million (27 percent) to $1,166 million in 2008 from $1,588 million in the prior year, and total segment revenues decreased by $92 million to $12,817 million in 2008, a 1 percent decrease from revenues of $12,909 million in 2007. While demand was weaker in 2008 compared to 2007, international and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than luxury and limited-service properties. The decrease in revenues included a $259 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. The results, 37 Table of Contents compared to the year-ago period, reflected a decrease of $261 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $51 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $37 million in gains and other income, $29 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, a decrease of $22 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $14 million of lower equity joint venture results. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $27 million (3 percent) increase in combined base management and franchise fees to $1,086 million in the 2008 period from $1,059 million in 2007 and a $23 million increase in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from rate increases in international markets, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Compared to 2007, incentive management fees decreased by $58 million (16 percent) in 2008 and reflected the recognition in 2007 of $17 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower RevPAR, higher property-level wages and benefits costs, and utilities costs, particularly in North America. In 2008, 56 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 67 percent in 2007. In addition, in 2008, 49 percent of our incentive fees were derived from international hotels versus 35 percent in 2007. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 2.7 percent and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties decreased by 2.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 3.6 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 3.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 1.5 percent (0.8 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties decreased by 1.1 percent (0.2 percent using actual dollars). Compared to the year-ago period, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2008 decreased by 70 basis points, reflecting the impact of stronger year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very tight cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year-over-year RevPAR decreases associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and also higher expenses in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. North American company-operated house profit margins declined by 140 basis points reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand and higher operating costs, including those associated with wages and benefits and utilities. For 2008, HP-PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 5.8 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties decreased by 8.0 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 2.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 254 properties, totaling 37,714 rooms, across our brands in 2009 and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added 5 residential properties (568 units). Highlights of the year included: • Converting 19 properties (3,989 rooms), or 10 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 13 percent of those rooms were located in international markets; • Opening approximately 23 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; • Adding 207 properties (24,346 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; and • Opening two new Marriott Vacation Club properties, one in Marco Island, Florida, and the other in Bangkok, Thailand. We also opened one Ritz-Carlton Destination Club property and one Ritz-Carlton Residences property in Kapalua Bay, Hawaii, one Ritz-Carlton Destination Club property in Lake Tahoe, California, and one Grand Residences by Marriott property in Kauai, Hawaii. We currently have approximately 100,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add 25,000 to 30,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2010. 38 Table of Contents We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised, and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010, for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009, and for 2007 include the 52 weeks from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 39 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2009 Change vs. 2008 2009 Change vs. 2008 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 66.3 % -4.3 % pts. 63.4 % -4.6 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 4,848 $ 5,631 $ 5,476 -14 % 3 % Segment results $ 272 $ 419 $ 478 -35 % -12 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (3,645 rooms) and 3 properties (800 rooms) left the system. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties decreased by 17.0 percent to $103.87, occupancy decreased by 4.3 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.6 percent to $157.10. The $147 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $71 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, a $15 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $3 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in gains and other income. The $71 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls. Fifty-one properties paid incentive fees in 2009 compared to 101 in 2008. The $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was primarily driven by lower RevPAR. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, decreased $15 million and primarily reflected $18 million of net losses in 2009 associated with several properties with weak demand, partially offset by a favorable variance of $3 million related to a property that was being renovated, and as a result was not operating at full capacity during 2008. The $4 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with one property that was sold for a loss in the 2008 period. The $3 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property and a $7 million impairment charge related to a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information), which were mostly offset by $12 million in cost reductions. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,322 million in 2009, compared to $4,951 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,611 rooms) and three properties (493 rooms) left the system. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties decreased by 1.6 percent to $123.98, occupancy decreased by 2.0 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.2 percent to $176.30. The $59 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, primarily reflected a $35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a $25 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $2 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition, in 2007, of business interruption insurance proceeds totaling $12 million associated with Hurricane Katrina and also reflected lower demand and property-level margins in 2008 compared to 2007. The slight increase of $2 million in base management and franchise fees was a product of unit growth and an additional week of sales, mostly offset by lower RevPAR. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable $7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008, $8 million of losses associated with three properties, one of which was a new property that opened in 2008, $5 million of lower contract termination fees received, $2 million of lower land rent income, and an unfavorable $3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property. 46 Table of Contents Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,951 million in 2008, compared to $4,782 million in 2007.

The properties that left the system were mainly franchised hotels associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties decreased by 20.0 percent to $68.83, occupancy for these properties decreased by 5.8 percentage points to 63.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 12.7 percent to $108.33. The $130 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected $59 million of lower base management and franchise fees, $35 million of lower incentive management fees, $17 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $9 million of lower joint venture equity earnings, $6 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $59 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was largely due to lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR, partially offset by new unit growth. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins resulting from weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls. Twenty-three properties paid incentive fees in 2009, compared to 256 in 2008. The $17 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million in lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties and $6 million of lower property-level margins associated with our corporate housing business. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected equity losses at one of our joint ventures as the related properties experienced weak demand. The $4 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $42 million impairment charge related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, mostly offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information). The net increase of $16 million associated with the 2008 accrual and 2009 impairment charge was partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily reflecting cost reductions that were part of our cost containment efforts. The $6 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividend distributions in the current year from one joint venture, which had a decline in available cash flow as a result of the weak demand environment. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,419 million in 2009, compared to $1,541 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 168 properties (19,747 rooms) and 21 properties (2,519 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. 47 Table of Contents In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties decreased by 4.2 percent to $85.83, occupancy decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 69.4 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 0.5 percent to $123.69. The $66 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected $43 million of lower incentive management fees, $14 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $13 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower gains and other income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth, partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees. The $43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins and the recognition, in 2007, of $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007. The $14 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected a $15 million charge related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information). The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn & Suites brand properties that left our system, and $7 million of lower income due to lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,541 million in 2008, compared to $1,470 million in 2007. International Lodging includes International Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International JW Marriott, International Renaissance Hotels, International Courtyard, International Fairfield Inn & Suites, International Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments.

In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties decreased by 18.0 percent to $108.45, occupancy for these properties decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 66.3 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.9 percent to $163.64. RevPAR declined in most markets around the world. The $117 million decrease in segment results in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $45 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million decrease in gains and other income, a decrease of $9 million in joint venture equity earnings, and $2 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses. The $45 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level margins, driven by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to 2008, partially offset by property-level cost controls. The $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was driven mainly by lower RevPAR, impacted by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, somewhat offset by the impact of new room additions. The $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $23 million of weaker results, driven by weak demand and lower RevPAR at some owned and leased properties, $13 million of lower termination fees, and $3 million of lower income reflecting conversions from leased properties to managed properties. The $8 million decrease in gains and other income reflected miscellaneous gain activity in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. Restructuring costs totaling $2 million reflected severance and fringe benefit costs. See the Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” for more information. 48 Table of Contents The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings was primarily driven by a $3 million impairment charge and $12 million in lower equity results at three joint ventures primarily reflecting lower demand. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” for more information on the joint venture impairment. The decrease also reflected an $11 million unfavorable impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures in 2008. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $15 million in cost reductions due to our cost containment efforts, partially offset by $3 million in guarantee reserves for two properties. See the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $529 million in 2009, compared to $707 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our International Lodging segment, we added 21 properties (6,619 rooms) and 16 properties (3,905 rooms) left the system, primarily due to quality issues. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 2.6 percent to $131.00, occupancy for these properties decreased by 2.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.0 percent to $180.81. Results for our international operations were favorable across most regions, but weakened progressively throughout 2008 and especially in the fourth quarter. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were strongest in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. The $25 million decrease in segment results in 2008, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected a $32 million decrease in gains and other income, a $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a decrease of $5 million in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by an $18 million increase in incentive management fees and an $11 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained unchanged in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in fees was largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, reflected unit growth and cost control plans, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. The $32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008, compared to 2007, reflected the recognition of gains totaling $9 million in 2008, compared to gains in 2007 of $41 million. The 2007 gains primarily reflected a $10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling $23 million associated with sales of real estate. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development. Joint venture equity results were lower than the prior year by $5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct of expenses remained unchanged and reflected $17 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, which was completely offset by $11 million of stronger results at some properties, $5 million of higher termination fees, and $1 million of higher branding fees. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $707 million in 2008, compared to $741 million in 2007. 49 Table of Contents Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 1,413 $ 1,659 $ 1,576 -15 % 5 % Segment results $ 17 $ 78 $ 72 -78 % 8 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 5 properties (916 rooms) and 1 property (374 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added 3 residential products (453 units) in 2009. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties decreased by 22.7 percent to $175.66, occupancy for these properties decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 59.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 13.8 percent to $295.11. Luxury Lodging has been particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business. The $61 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected a $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, a $17 million decrease in base management fees, $13 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $6 million decrease in incentive management fees, and $5 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses. The $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired, partially offset by a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information). The $17 million decrease in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR declines associated with weaker demand. The $6 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls and new unit growth. The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of lower results at three properties driven by weak demand and the resulting RevPAR declines in 2009 and $6 million of lower residential branding fees. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2009 reflected $4 million in bad debt expense related to an accounts receivable balance we deemed to be uncollectible, $5 million of expenses primarily related to write-offs of other assets that we deemed non-recoverable, $3 million in start-up costs related to a new brand, and a $2 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by $9 million in cost reductions related to our cost containment efforts. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,143 million in 2009, compared to $1,350 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added four properties (1,195 rooms) and one property (517 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added seven residential products (654 units) in 2008. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties decreased by 0.1 percent to $225.87, occupancy for these properties decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 69.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.7 percent to $326.63. The $6 million increase in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected a $7 million increase in base management and incentive management fees and $18 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $8 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, an $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, $1 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information), and a $1 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees over the year-ago period reflected new properties added to the system, partially offset by the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years. 50 Table of Contents The $18 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges of $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” compared to $6 million of depreciation charges for that same property in 2008, as well as expenses totaling $3 million in 2007 associated with opening a new leased property, $10 million of improved results in 2008 associated with two properties, one of which was being renovated in 2007, and $2 million of increased branding fees in 2008. The $8 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected costs associated with unit growth and development as well as bad debt expense related to accounts receivable deemed uncollectible (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information). The $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information). Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2008, compared to $1,307 million in 2007. 51 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands.

Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $411 million (38 percent), compared to 2008, to $665 million from $1,076 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2009, compared to 2008, reflected a $396 million decrease in timeshare contract sales and a $22 million decrease in fractional contract sales, partially offset by $7 million of lower residential net cancellation allowances on contract sales. Sales of fractional and timeshare intervals decreased significantly as a result of weak demand, but were partially offset by a decrease in cancellation allowances of $32 million, as compared with prior year, recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for additional information). The $311 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,439 million from $1,750 million primarily reflected a $300 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $16 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, partially offset by a $5 million increase in base management fees. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue. Timeshare segment revenues in 2009 and 2008 included $46 million and $68 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $37 million and $16 million, respectively. Segment losses of $679 million in 2009 increased by $707 million from $28 million of segment income in 2008, and reflected $685 million of impairments ($614 million of which we reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption and $71 million of which we reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” section for more information on the impairments), $17 million of higher restructuring costs, $23 million in lower joint venture equity earnings, a $14 million 52 Table of Contents decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, and $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $31 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of higher base management fees. The $6 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write-down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe as noted in the “2008 Compared to 2007” discussion that follows. The $43 million increase in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected: (1) a $21 million increase in note sale gains, from $16 million in 2008, which included a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness, to $37 million in 2009, due to only one note sale in 2008 as compared with two note sales in 2009; (2) $22 million of increased residual interest accretion reflecting incremental accretion from the second quarter 2008, first quarter 2009, and fourth quarter 2009 note sales; (3) a $12 million decrease in the charge that reduced the valuation of residual interests to $20 million in 2009 from $32 million in 2008; and (4) a $13 million decrease in the cost of financing due to cost containment efforts. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $22 million of lower interest income because of lower notes receivable balances in 2009 due to the completion of the 2009 second and fourth quarter note sales; and $5 million of lower settlement revenue, net of expenses, due to lower settlement volume. The $20 million recorded charge for the reduced value of residual interests in 2009 consisted of a $19 million unfavorable impact for eight previously securitized pools that reached performance triggers as a result of increased defaults in 2009, partially offset by a $4 million benefit for the release of seven of the eight performance triggers later in 2009 due to improved loan performance, and a $5 million net unfavorable impact from changes in the assumptions for discount, default and prepayment rates that we used in our estimate of fair market value (see the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for more information). The $17 million decrease in services revenue net of expenses was driven by lower rental revenue due to the weak demand and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. The $15 million increase in other revenue, net of expenses, was primarily a result of higher marketing and sales revenue. The $17 million increase in restructuring costs reflected a $24 million increase in facilities exit costs and $1 million increase in severance costs, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in development cancellations (see the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for additional information). The $31 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $33 million in cost savings primarily generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions and other cost reductions and a $4 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008, partially offset by a $7 million 2009 write-off of capitalized software development costs related to a project for which we have decided not to pursue further development. See the “Other Charges” caption in the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section for additional information on the write-off of capitalized software costs. Joint venture equity earnings decreased by $23 million and primarily reflected decreased earnings from a joint venture, attributable to weak 2009 demand for a residential and fractional project. The $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to a $12 million noncontrolling interest benefit recorded in 2008 related to an impairment of a joint venture we consolidate. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $269 million in 2009, compared to $285 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $325 million (23 percent) compared to 2007 to $1,076 million from $1,401 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2008, compared to the prior year, reflected a $173 million decrease in timeshare sales, an $83 million decrease in residential sales, and a $69 million decrease in fractional sales. The decrease in timeshare contract sales reflected the impact of projects approaching sellout and significantly lower demand. Sales of residential and fractional units were significantly impacted by weak demand, as well 53 Table of Contents as increased cancellation allowances of $115 million recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage-of-completion method for certain projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information). The $315 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,750 million from $2,065 million reflected a $324 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, and a $1 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008, a $32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests, contract cancellation allowances of $17 million, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, as well as the recognition, in 2007, of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year, and increased services revenue. Timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included $68 million and $50 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $16 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Segment results of $28 million in 2008 decreased by $278 million from $306 million in 2007, and reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $28 million of restructuring costs, and $13 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $24 million of higher net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and $1 million in higher joint venture equity earnings. The $261 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, increased marketing and sales costs, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, start-up costs in 2008 for newer projects, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, a $9 million impact from inventory write-downs related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, and a $5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information). In addition, development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge. We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) in the 2008 third quarter within the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We made the adjustment in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at year-end 2008. The predominant items we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations, and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year risk-free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent). The $25 million noncontrolling interests benefit reflected our joint venture partner’s portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate. The $25 million noncontrolling interests benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008, representing our joint venture partner’s pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. The $95 million decrease in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected $65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007, mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007, $42 million of lower residual interest accretion, and $6 million of increased financing costs, partially offset by $18 million of increased interest income. Lower note sale gains of $65 million reflected a $12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the $42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a $32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information regarding these charges). In 2008 and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $300 million and $520 million, respectively. The $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year. 54 Table of Contents The $28 million of restructuring costs represented $14 million in severance costs, $9 million in development cancellations, and $5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred). The $13 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits. Joint venture equity earnings increased $1 million and reflected $10 million of start-up losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures, mostly offset by $7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information) and $3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $285 million in 2008, compared to $275 million in 2007. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under IRC Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase-out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, “Discontinued Operations-Synthetic Fuel,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 2008 Compared to 2007 The synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $1 million in 2008 and $352 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment totaled $3 million, net of tax, in 2008, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment of $3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. During 2009, we granted 0.8 million restricted stock units and 0.5 million Employee SARs, 5,600 Non-employee SARs, and 39,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No. 4, “Share-Based Compensation,” later in this report for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for information on both (1) our adoption of new accounting standards in 2009, none of which had a material impact on our financial statements and (2) our first quarter of 2010 adoption of the following recently issued accounting standards and the estimated initial impact of those adoptions on our financial statements: Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets-an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 140,” or Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-16, “Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets,” and FAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),” or Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-17, “Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities.” The impact of adopting these recently issued accounting standards could, in subsequent periods, also prevent us from meeting the derecognition criteria of ASC 860, and, accordingly, prevent us from achieving sale accounting for future securitization transactions because the underlying securitization vehicles may require consolidation. We estimate that if we had adopted the aforementioned new accounting standards as of the first day of our 2009 fiscal year, we would have reported an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal-year 2009 of approximately $18 million, primarily attributable to the difference between the increased amount of interest income from notes held (net of interest expense to third party debt holders) and the previously recorded accretion income attributed to residual interests for our past securitization transactions. After we adopt these new accounting standards, we will recognize higher amounts of interest income from notes held and interest expense, and we will no longer recognize gains from the sales of our timeshare notes. 55 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels, as well as to develop timeshare properties. Capital markets were disrupted in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have remained challenging due to the worldwide financial crisis. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. Our Credit Facility, which expires on May 14, 2012, and associated letters of credit, provide for $2.4 billion of aggregate effective borrowings and has supported our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread based on the credit ratings for our public debt. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits the Company’s maximum leverage (consisting of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future. We believe the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year-end 2009, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.978 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $1.863 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $115 million. Borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of $1.863 billion was calculated as $2.404 billion of allowable effective aggregate borrowings under our Credit Facility, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $116 million, and less Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of $425 million. As noted in the previous paragraphs, we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs and because we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions become considerably worse than we currently anticipate. Until the 2008 fourth quarter, when disruptions in the financial markets significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. At that time we suspended issuing commercial paper and used funds borrowed under the Credit Facility to repay all of our previously issued commercial paper as it matured. Our Standard and Poor’s commercial paper rating at the end of 2009 was A3. Because the current market for A3 commercial paper is very limited, it would be very difficult to rely on the use of this market as a meaningful source of liquidity, and we do not anticipate issuing commercial paper under these conditions. When we had commercial paper outstanding, we classified it as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserved unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market was not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings matured, as was the case in the 2008 fourth quarter. Given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, the limitations on our ability to access the commercial paper market and fluctuations in the costs of issuing commercial paper have not affected our liquidity, and we do not expect they will do so in the future. In 2009, the three major credit rating agencies reduced our long-term debt ratings to their lowest investment grade level. Although the agencies’ published outlooks indicate that they do not currently plan to reduce our debt ratings to below investment grade, we cannot assure you that our ratings will remain at their current levels. Any further downgrades of our long-term debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, Fitch Ratings, or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital, limit our access to the capital markets, or permit access only on terms that are more restrictive than those of our current outstanding debt. 56 Table of Contents On September 15, 2009, we made a $79 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our then outstanding Series C Senior Notes. We do not have any further public debt maturities until June 15, 2012. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash from operations $ 868 $ 641 $ 778 Depreciation expense 151 155 162 Amortization expense 34 35 35 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.2 to 1.0 at year-end 2009 and 1.3 to 1.0 at year-end 2008. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 — 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x In response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new development. See “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges” in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” section for additional information. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales that we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or when the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Timeshare segment development in excess of cost of sales $ (4 ) $ (299 ) $ (55 ) New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (147 ) (525 ) (559 ) Note repurchases (81 ) (56 ) (30 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 29 126 (16 ) Note sale gains (37 ) (16 ) (81 ) Note sale proceeds 349 237 515 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 82 102 106 Other cash (outflows) inflows (45 ) 33 (35 ) Net cash inflows (outflows) from Timeshare segment activity $ 146 $ (398 ) $ (155 ) Additionally, as discussed in more detail in the “Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation” caption in Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” eight previously securitized note pools reached performance triggers in 2009 as a result of increased defaults. As of year-end 2009, loan performance had improved sufficiently in all but one of these pools to cure the performance triggers. As compared to full year 2008, our cash inflows were reduced by approximately $17 million in 2009 as a result of the performance triggers. On March 9, 2009, we completed a private placement of approximately $205 million of floating-rate Timeshare Loan Backed Notes with a bank-administered commercial paper conduit. We contributed approximately $284 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2009-1 Trust”). On the same day, the 2009-1 Trust issued approximately $205 million of the 2009-1 Trust’s notes. In connection with the private placement of notes receivable, we received proceeds of approximately $181 million, net of costs, and retained $94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity, which included $81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and $13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip. We measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer. The notes effectively owned after the transfer require accounting treatment as notes receivable and are carried at the basis established at the date of transfer unless we deem them non-recoverable in the future, in which case we would record a valuation allowance. In connection with this March 2009 note sale, we recorded a $1 million loss, which was included within the “Timeshare sales and services” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 57 Table of Contents On October 21, 2009, we sold a pool of approximately $380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2009-2 Trust”). Simultaneous with the sale, investors purchased $317 million of 4.809 percent Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2009-2 Trust in a private placement. As part of this transaction, we paid off the notes that the 2009-1 Trust issued in March 2009 and reacquired approximately $233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 2009-1 Trust. We included approximately $218 million of these reacquired loans in the October 21, 2009 sale. As consideration for our sale of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 2009-2 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. These cash proceeds are net of approximately $145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction. In connection with this October 2009 note sale, we recorded a $38 million gain, which was included within the “Timeshare sales and services” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2008 and much of 2009, less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets significantly reduced our gain from Timeshare segment note sales, as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and lower overall amounts in proportion to the amounts of mortgage notes purchased. As a result, in the second quarter 2008 and for both transactions in 2009, we retained larger residual interests in the applicable trusts than we had in prior transactions. In the first quarter 2009 note sale, the bank administered conduit that purchased our AAA rated mortgage notes provided $205 million in funding, with the floating interest rate swapped into an effective fixed interest rate of 9.87 percent. This compares with effective interest rates (after taking into account the impact of the corresponding swaps) for the AAA rated notes issued by the trusts of 7.19 percent for the 2008 second quarter notes sale; 5.91 percent for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale; and 5.54 percent for the 2007 second quarter note sale. By the fourth quarter of 2009, the market improved and we issued $380 million of AAA rated mortgage notes (included both new mortgage notes of $162 million and mortgage notes from the conduit transaction in the first quarter of 2009 of $218 million) at an effective fixed interest rate of 4.81 percent. In addition, while the trusts in two 2007 securitizations each also issued 15.5 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at ratings of less than AAA, we concluded that the market for lower rated notes during 2008 and 2009 was insufficient to permit issuance of AA, A, and BBB+ rated notes at attractive spreads. Accordingly, we decided to retain larger residual interests, or principal-only strips, in the trusts associated with each transaction. We had residual interests of $214 million and $221 million, respectively, at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, which we recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term receivables of $144 million and $134 million, respectively, and other current assets of $70 million and $87 million, respectively. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which we measured using Level 3 inputs (which are described in Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements”) in the fair value measurement hierarchy, accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year-end 2009 that are required to be measured at fair value using the fair value measurement guidance. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded trading gains of $18 million and losses of $9 million, respectively, and in 2007, we recorded trading gains of $30 million. For additional information on how we estimate the fair value of our residual interests and our assumptions used, including a stress test of those assumptions, please see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements.” For additional information on our timeshare note sales, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, our maximum exposure to loss on those securitized notes, and contractual servicing fees that we earned, see Footnote No. 13, “Asset Securitizations.” See also “Future Adoption of Accounting Standards” and Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for discussions of the expected impact of our future adoption of amendments to the accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and to reporting on a consolidated basis on existing and future asset securitizations. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2010 through 2029, the cost of completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $2.9 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which remain subject to change. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $147 million in 2009, $357 million in 2008, and $671 million in 2007 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures decreased primarily due to reduced development spending, a result of our cost containment efforts, as well as expenditures related to improvements to existing properties that were completed in the prior year . We expect that near-term 58 Table of Contents capital expenditures will be consistent with 2009 levels. See the discussion of “Development and Financing Risks” within the Risk Factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million in 2009, $38 million in 2008, and $745 million in 2007. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2009 and 2008, amounted to net loan advances of $45 million and $17 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Senior loans outstanding totaled $1 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year-end 2009 and $2 million, all of which was long-term, at year-end 2008. Mezzanine and other loans totaled $195 million (which included a current portion of $95 million) at year-end 2009 and $236 million (which included a current portion of $15 million) at year-end 2008. In 2009, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans, decreased by $42 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $28 million in 2009, $25 million in 2008, and $40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt decreased by $797 million in 2009, to $2,298 million at year-end 2009 from $3,095 million, and reflected a $544 million decrease in borrowings under our Credit Facility, the repayment, upon maturity, of $79 million (including interest) of Series C Senior Notes in 2009, the repurchase of $119 million in book value ($122 million in principal amount) of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $57 million. Debt increased by $130 million in 2008, to $3,095 million at year-end 2008 from $2,965 million at year-end 2007, and reflected $969 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of $585 million, the repayment, upon maturity, of $91 million of Series E Senior Notes in the 2008 first quarter, repurchase of $109 million of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $54 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2009, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 4.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.7 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2009. At the end of 2009, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB- from Standard and Poor’s and Baa3 from Moody’s. See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional information on our Credit Facility. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. In 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We did not purchase any shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2009. We purchased 11.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share and 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year-end 2009, 21.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We do not currently anticipate share repurchase activity in 2010. 59 Table of Contents Dividends. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on February 4, 2010, and stock dividends on May 1, August 6, and November 5, 2009, respectively. As a result, for periods prior to the stock dividends, we have retroactively adjusted, as of the dates of record, all share and per share data in this report. See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on these stock dividends. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2009: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 2,913 $ 162 $ 985 $ 559 $ 1,207 Capital lease obligations (1) 10 1 2 2 5 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,305 144 260 214 687 Non-recourse 382 16 31 28 307 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 92 27 41 20 4 Purchase obligations 124 120 2 2 — Other long-term liabilities 140 — 26 11 103 Total contractual obligations $ 4,966 $ 470 $ 1,347 $ 836 $ 2,313 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2009 of $249 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. We anticipate concluding U.S. federal appeals negotiations for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years in the next 12 months, where the items under consideration include the taxation of our loyalty and gift card programs and the treatment of funds received from foreign subsidiaries. The conclusion of the negotiations could have a material impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balances. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year-end 2009: Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 279 $ 85 $ 52 $ 89 $ 53 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 233 43 88 72 30 Total guarantee commitments $ 512 $ 128 $ 140 $ 161 $ 83 In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Our liability related to this guarantee is included in our liability for anticipated project funding disclosed in Footnote No. 20, “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges.” We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of CAD $466 million (USD $441 million). We do not expect to fund under this project completion guarantee. For additional information on these project completion guarantees, including our pro rata ownership percentages, see the “Guarantees” caption within Footnote No. 18, “Contingencies.” For additional information on our guarantees, including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into, see the “Guarantees” caption within Footnote No. 18, “Contingencies.” In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. 60 Table of Contents We also had the following other commitments, including loan and investment commitments, outstanding at year-end 2009: Loan and Investment Commitments Amount of Loan and Investment Commitments Expected Funding By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total loan commitments $ 4 $ 1 $ 2 $ — $ 1 Total investment commitments 49 — 1 38 10 Total other commitments $ 53 $ 1 $ 3 $ 38 $ 11 For further information on our loan and investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Loan and Investment Commitments” caption within Footnote No. 18, “Contingencies.” At year-end 2009, we also had $116 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2009 totaled $361 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 49 percent. For other information regarding these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 24, “Related Party Transactions.” CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on: • Marriott Rewards, our frequent guest loyalty program, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to Marriott Rewards; • Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill; • Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets; • Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures; 61 Table of Contents • Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies; • Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; • Loan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities. We account for our investment as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2009, our investment had a fair value of $18 million. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in foreign operations hedges, fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2009, our consolidated balance sheet included a $3 million asset and a $1 million liability for foreign exchange forwards, a $3 million liability related to a fair value interest rate swap and a $1 million liability for interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments. Please see Footnote No. 17, “Derivative Instruments” for additional information, including the risks associated with our derivative instruments, their impact on our consolidated financial statements, the notional amounts, and their maturity dates. 62 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2009 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,545 properties (618,104 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2010 and include 34 home and condominium products (3,391 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,043 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 70 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. During 2010 we broadened our timeshare interval product offering to include the sale of the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program in North America and the Caribbean. The Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program offers greater flexibility, further personalization and more experience opportunities for participating timeshare owners. See the “Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program” caption later in this Form 10-K for additional information. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences) and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Lodging Business conditions for our lodging business improved in 2010. While the recent recession significantly impacted lodging demand and hotel pricing, occupancies began to improve late in 2009 and that improvement continued throughout 2010. Room rates began to stabilize and improve in some markets in the 2010 second quarter, and that improvement continued, strengthened and expanded to other markets throughout the rest of 2010. In 2010, worldwide average daily rates on a constant dollar basis stayed the same as 2009 for company-operated properties. Worldwide RevPAR for company-operated properties increased 6.3 percent on a constant dollar basis for 2010, as compared to 2009, and occupancy increased 4.1 percentage points to 68.7 percent. While worldwide RevPAR for 2010 remained well below 2008 levels, we continued to see strengthening in properties in Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, and in our luxury properties around the world. Our hotels in Asia are particularly benefitting from strong economic growth in that region. Additionally, hotels in North America experienced stronger demand from corporate transient and association group customers in 2010 as compared to 2009, and that demand continued to strengthen progressively during the 2010 period. However, property-level banquet and catering spending continues to be weak primarily reflecting tight budgets and fewer group functions; although we did experience some improvement late in 2010. During the 2010 first quarter, group meeting cancellations declined to typical levels, and expected revenue from group meetings continued to improve throughout 2010. While our booking windows for both group business and transient business remain very short, our pace of bookings for group business for future periods continued to improve throughout 2010. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates at many hotels. Negotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented 14 percent of our full-service hotel room nights for 2010 in North America. By late 2010, demand trends had further strengthened, and we had negotiated rates with more 25 Table of Contents than two-thirds of our 2011 special corporate rate clients. Those rates were meaningfully higher than those we negotiated in 2009 and early 2010. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. We expect to complete negotiations with our remaining special corporate business clients in the 2011 first quarter. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend. Group business pricing is also inflexible in the near term, as some group business may be booked several years in advance of guest arrival. However, as a result of the recent recession, shorter group booking windows became more common for 2010 than they were in prior years. Accordingly, with strengthening demand, group business booked in 2010 showed stronger price improvement than business booked in 2009, and “in-the-year-for-the-year” bookings also increased in 2010. Properties in our system are maintaining very tight cost controls, as we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property-level cost saving initiatives such as adjusting menus and restaurant hours, modifying room amenities, cross-training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, and not filling some vacant positions. We also reduced above-property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have not filled certain above-property vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2010, we operated 45 percent of the hotel rooms in our system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, and we owned or leased 2 percent. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make. We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable properties, systemwide RevPAR (which includes data from our franchised, managed, owned, and leased properties) increased by 4.9 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels in most markets, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. For our properties outside North America, systemwide RevPAR for 2010 increased 9.2 percent versus 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. Timeshare We launched the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (“MVCD Program”) in North America and the Caribbean in June 2010, and we are initially focusing our marketing efforts on existing customers. As a result, in 2010, contract sales to existing owners increased 31 percent while sales to new customers declined. We expect accelerated sales to new customers in 2011. See the “Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program” caption later in this Form 10-K for additional information. Contract sales for our timeshare, fractional, and residential products increased modestly in 2010, compared to 2009, largely due to a decline in contract sales cancellation allowances. We adjust our contract sales for cancellation allowances that we record in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to pre-closing contract cancellations. At the same time, contract sales were constrained by difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. By the end of 2010, timeshare pricing improved because we had largely discontinued or reduced the purchase incentives and targeted marketing efforts instituted in 2009. 26 Table of Contents Rental revenues increased in 2010 with stronger leisure demand for our Marriott Vacation Club product and greater available rental inventory. Demand for fractional and residential units remains weak. Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of contract sales continue to improve. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties continue to maintain very tight cost controls, and we have not filled certain vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, current demand may not always be reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. On January 2, 2010, the first day of our 2010 fiscal year, we adopted the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. As a result of adopting these standards in the 2010 first quarter, we consolidated 13 existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions, and we recorded a one-time non-cash after-tax reduction to shareholders’ equity of $146 million ($238 million pretax) in the 2010 first quarter, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more detailed information on our adoption of these new accounting topics, including the impact to our Balance Sheet and Statement of Income. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2010, 2009, and 2008. Continuing Operations Revenues 2010 Compared to 2009 Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million). The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income attributable to us. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property-level 27 Table of Contents costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property-level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner. With particularly weak demand and low property-level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system. Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges In 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Income Statement ($502 million after-tax), including $614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption, and $138 million of pretax charges that impacted non-operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non-cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments. See Footnote No. 18, “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information, including a table showing the composition of the charges. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges As a result of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred $55 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008. As part of these actions we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel development, above-property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, please see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. For the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception and a roll forward of the restructuring liability through year-end 28 Table of Contents 2010, please see Footnote No. 19, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As a result of our restructuring efforts, we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010, which were primarily reflected in our Income Statement under the expense captions noted: (i) $113 million ($73 million after-tax) for our Timeshare segment, under “Timeshare-direct” and “General, administrative, and other”; (ii) $12 million ($8 million after-tax) for hotel development across several of our Lodging segments, primarily under “General, administrative, and other”; and (iii) $10 million ($8 million after-tax) for reducing above property-level lodging management personnel under “General, administrative, and other.” Operating Income (Loss) 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating income increased by $847 million to operating income of $695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of $152 million in 2009. The increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of $614 million related to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $51 million decrease in restructuring costs, $28 million of higher incentive management fees, and $23 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $58 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. We note the reasons for the increase of $73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of $28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding “Revenues” section. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled $199 million. The increase of $116 million as compared to 2009, primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding “Revenues” section. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $23 million (34 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs, $8 million of higher branding fees, a $4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010, and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property-level margins, partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $58 million (8 percent) to $780 million in 2010 from $722 million in 2009. The increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges: an $84 million long-lived asset impairment associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a $13 million long-lived asset impairment (allocated to our Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long-lived asset impairment (allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment). See Footnote No. 8, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding these three impairment charges. In addition, we recorded a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge (allocated to our North American Full-Service segment) in 2010. See the North American Full-Service segment discussion for additional information regarding this impairment charge. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase was $35 million of higher incentive compensation costs, $14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally, $7 million of increased currency exchange losses, and $2 million of increased legal expenses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an $8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, and a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States. In addition, the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010: $49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by an $11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls; a $7 million write-off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. The year-over-year comparison also reflected a $15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses (with changes to our deferred compensation plan, general, administrative, and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred 29 Table of Contents compensation impact, compared with $15 million of mark-to-market valuation expenses in 2009). The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010, compared with a $43 million provision in 2009, which reflected $29 million associated with one Luxury segment project and $14 million associated with a North American Limited-Service segment portfolio. The $58 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses was comprised of: a $77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $5 million increase impacting our Timeshare segment; an $8 million decrease impacting our North American Limited-Service segment; an $8 million decrease impacting our Luxury segment; a $7 million decrease impacting our North American Full-Service segment; and a $1 million decrease impacting our International segment. 2009 Compared to 2008 Operating income decreased by $917 million (120 percent) to an operating loss of $152 million in 2009 from operating income of $765 million in 2008. The decrease in operating income reflected Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2009 of $614 million, $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees, $69 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of $4 million. In the preceding “Revenues” section, we note the reasons for the decrease of $157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of $156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled $83 million. The decline of $6 million (7 percent) from $89 million in 2008 primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write-down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. Higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note securitization gains, increased residual interest accretion, a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests, and a decrease in the cost of financing, partially offset by lower interest income. Lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this section for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $69 million (50 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of $65 million in revenue, net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties, as well as our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $81 million (10 percent) to $722 million in 2009 from $803 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflected $186 million of lower expenses, largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a $12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008. Additionally, in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment and recorded a $3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the “General, administrative, and other” expense caption on our Income Statement. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2008 Form 10-K. These benefits were partially offset by the following items: $49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls; 2009 provisions for loan losses of $43 million for two loans partially offset by a $22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan; an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property; a $7 million write-off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; $12 million of expenses primarily related to write-offs of other assets that we deemed non-recoverable, performance cure accruals, and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. Additionally, 2009 included a $15 million unfavorable impact 30 Table of Contents associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to a $28 million favorable impact in 2008, both of which reflected mark-to-market valuations. Of the $81 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, a $1 million increase was attributable to our Lodging segments, a $31 million decrease was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and a $51 million decrease was unallocated. Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains (losses) and other income for 2010, 2009, and 2008: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 0 $ 21 $ 28 Gains on sales of real estate and other 34 10 14 Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments 1 3 (1 ) Income/(loss) from cost method joint ventures 0 2 (3 ) Impairment of equity securities 0 (5 ) 0 $ 35 $ 31 $ 38 2010 Compared to 2009 We did not extinguish any debt in 2010. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the $98 million purchase price and the $119 million net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. 2009 Compared to 2008 See the previous paragraph for information on our debt extinguishment and impairment of equity securities in 2009. We did not extinguish any debt in 2008. Interest Expense 2010 Compared to 2009 Interest expense increased by $62 million (53 percent) to $180 million in 2010 compared to $118 million in 2009. This increase was driven by: (1) the consolidation of $1,121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes, which resulted in a $55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt; (2) a $14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects; and (3) $12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan. These increases were partially offset by: (1) $12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of $122 million of principal amount of our Senior Notes in 2009, the maturity of our Series C Senior Notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions; and (2) a $7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (our “Credit Facility”), which primarily reflected lower average borrowings. 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest expense decreased by $45 million (28 percent) to $118 million in 2009 compared to $163 million in 2008. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased by $25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. We also benefited from a $26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, and the repurchase of some of our Senior Notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information), which resulted in a $12 million reduction to interest expense, and finally, other interest expense decreases of $5 million. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a $23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects. Interest Income and Income Tax 2010 Compared to 2009 Interest income decreased by $6 million (24 percent) to $19 million in 2010, from $25 million in 2009, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009. Because we recognize 31 Table of Contents interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment. The decline in interest income also reflected a $2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan. Our income tax expense increased by $158 million (243 percent) to a provision of $93 million in 2010 from a benefit of $65 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 (as compared to a pretax loss in 2009) and $14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan (there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses, compared with changes which had a $14 million favorable impact in 2009). The increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010, as 2009 reflected $52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on our treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In conjunction with that settlement, we recorded an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010. Our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a $12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years’ estimated foreign tax expense. 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest income decreased by $14 million (36 percent) to $25 million in 2009, from $39 million in 2008, primarily reflecting $8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009. The decline in interest income also reflected $5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances, $2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008, and $2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan, partially offset by $4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at year-end 2008 and in 2009. Our tax provision decreased by $415 million (119 percent) to a benefit of $65 million in 2009 from a provision of $350 million in 2008, reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and $43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan. The decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of non-U.S. income in jurisdictions with low tax rates. The 2009 tax rate also reflected $52 million of income tax expense, primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, an issue that was the subject of ongoing discussions at that time between us and the IRS. The charges recorded in 2009 primarily related to our then current exposure related to this issue. In addition to tax expense on pretax earnings, tax expense for 2008 also reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Equity in (Losses) Earnings 2010 Compared to 2009 Equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 decreased by $48 million from equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a $30 million impairment charge associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments, both incurred in 2009. In the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an $11 million reversal of a funding liability (recorded in 2009) due to progress in that quarter on certain construction-related legal claims and other factors. See Footnote No. 18, “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding this reversal. Increased earnings of $5 million for our International segment joint ventures and $3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our Timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses. A 2010 impairment charge of $5 million associated with our North American Limited-Service segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts. 2009 Compared to 2008 Equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 increased by $81 million from equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired. The decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to $15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains, and $5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture. Further contributing to the decline were $24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a Timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project, $7 million of equity losses associated with a North American Limited-Service segment joint venture, a $3 million impairment and $2 million of other equity losses associated with an International segment joint venture, and $9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures, all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment. The unfavorable impacts also included a $3 million impairment 32 Table of Contents charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information on some of these joint venture impairments. Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2010 Compared to 2009 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $7 million in 2010 to zero, compared to $7 million in 2009. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses. 2009 Compared to 2008 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $8 million in 2009 to $7 million compared to $15 million in 2008. Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 Income from continuing operations of $458 million in 2010 increased by $811 million (230 percent) from a loss of $353 million in 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott of $458 million in 2010 increased by $804 million (232 percent) from a loss of $346 million in 2009, and diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott of $1.21 per share increased by $2.18 (225 percent) from losses of $0.97 per share in 2009. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss),” the $458 million increase in income from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2009 ($752 million), higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($116 million), lower restructuring costs ($51 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($73 million), lower equity in losses ($48 million), higher incentive management fees ($28 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($23 million), and higher gains and other income ($4 million). These favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes ($158 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($58 million), higher interest expense ($62 million), and lower interest income ($6 million). 2009 Compared to 2008 Compared to the prior year, loss from continuing operations increased by $697 million (203 percent) to a 2009 loss of $353 million from 2008 income of $344 million, loss from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $705 million (196 percent) to a 2009 loss of $346 million from 2008 income of $359 million, and diluted losses per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $1.94 (200 percent) to $0.97 per share from earnings of $0.97 per share. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss),” the $697 million increase in loss from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to 2009 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges ($752 million), lower incentive management fees ($157 million), lower base management and franchise fees ($156 million), lower equity in earnings ($81 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($69 million), lower interest income ($14 million), lower gains and other income ($7 million), and lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($6 million). Lower income taxes ($415 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million), lower interest expense ($45 million), and lower restructuring costs ($4 million) partially offset the unfavorable variances. Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA, a financial measure which is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and 33 Table of Contents amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We also evaluate adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance. Our adjusted EBITDA excludes the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs and other charges totaling $192 million and $213 million, respectively, the 2009 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges totaling $752 million, and for 2010, both impairment charges totaling $111 million and the $11 million reversal of a prior year impairment charge. We evaluate adjusted EBITDA that excludes these items to allow for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting adjusted EBITDA’s usefulness as a comparative measure. The table below shows our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations and reconciles those measures with Net Income (Loss) attributable to Marriott.

See Footnote No. 17, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, and other information about each segment, including revenues, income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Marriott, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, equity in (losses) earnings of equity method investees, assets, and capital expenditures. At year-end 2010, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,043 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. Total North American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 322 13 335 126,149 4,837 130,986 Marriott Conference Centers 11 0 11 3,298 0 3,298 JW Marriott 19 1 20 10,748 221 10,969 Renaissance Hotels 76 2 78 27,939 790 28,729 Renaissance ClubSport 2 0 2 349 0 349 Autograph Collection 13 0 13 3,828 0 3,828 443 16 459 172,311 5,848 178,159 North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 793 16 809 110,922 2,793 113,715 Fairfield Inn & Suites 648 9 657 58,510 1,029 59,539 SpringHill Suites 273 1 274 31,961 124 32,085 Residence Inn 595 17 612 71,571 2,450 74,021 TownePlace Suites 192 1 193 19,320 105 19,425 2,501 44 2,545 292,284 6,501 298,785 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 155 159 2,767 44,981 47,748 JW Marriott 1 28 29 387 10,631 11,018 Renaissance Hotels 0 66 66 0 21,930 21,930 Courtyard 2 81 83 712 16,642 17,354 Fairfield Inn & Suites 0 1 1 0 206 206 Residence Inn 0 1 1 0 109 109 Marriott Executive Apartments 0 23 23 0 3,775 3,775 7 355 362 3,866 98,274 102,140 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton 39 35 74 11,587 10,457 22,044 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 0 2 2 0 117 117 EDITION 1 0 1 353 0 353 The Ritz-Carlton-Residential (2) 27 1 28 2,973 112 3,085 The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments 0 3 3 0 458 458 67 41 108 14,913 11,144 26,057 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 42 11 53 9,800 2,118 11,918 The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club 8 2 10 359 132 491 The Ritz-Carlton Residences (2) 3 1 4 222 16 238 Grand Residences by Marriott-Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential (1), (2) 2 0 2 68 0 68 56 15 71 10,648 2,315 12,963 Total 3,074 471 3,545 494,022 124,082 618,104 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) exited the system in 2010. Total segment financial results increased by $979 million to $983 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009, and total segment revenues increased by $780 million to $11,611 million in 2010, a 7 percent increase from revenues of $10,831 million in 2009. The year-over-year increase in revenues included a $557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2009, reflected a favorable variance from $685 million of 2009 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, $614 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption and $71 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption of our Income Statements, an increase of $116 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $19 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,003 million in 2010 from $930 million in 2009, a $48 million decrease in restructuring costs, $35 million of lower joint venture equity losses, $28 million of higher incentive management fees to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, an increase of $21 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $21 million increase in gains and other income. These favorable variances were partially offset by $55 million of increased interest expense and an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit. For more detailed information regarding the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss).” In 2010, 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009. In addition, in 2010, 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental United States versus 67 percent in 2009. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region and brand. Compared to 2009, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 6.4 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand, partially offset by decreased average daily rates. North American company-operated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 3.8 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties, partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 10.6 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight property-level cost controls. 2009 Compared to 2008 We added 254 properties (37,714 rooms) and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) exited the system in 2009. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added five residential properties (568 units) in 2009. Total segment financial results decreased by $1,162 million (100 percent) to $4 million in 2009 from $1,166 million in 2008, and total segment revenues decreased by $1,986 million to $10,831 million in 2009, a 15 percent decrease from total segment revenues of $12,817 million in 2008. As discussed in more detail earlier in this report, demand was weaker in 2009 than 2008. The decrease in revenues included a $1,152 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2008, reflected $685 million of Timeshare impairment charges ($614 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption and $71 million of which we reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption of our Income Statements. See the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” section for more information on the impairments), $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined 2009 base management and franchise fees, $85 million of owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $63 million of lower equity joint venture results, $18 million of higher restructuring costs, a $13 million decrease in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interests benefit, a decrease of $9 million in gains and other income, and a decrease 36 Table of Contents of $6 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $30 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses. These decreases included $80 million in other charges (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K), with $57 million recorded in general, administrative, and other expenses and $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. The $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR in 2009. Incentive management fees decreased by $157 million and reflected lower property-level operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand, somewhat offset by property-level cost controls. With lower property-level operating income, many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and, as a result, we earned no incentive fees from those properties. In 2009, 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside North America versus 49 percent in 2008. Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2009 decreased by 380 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated HP-PAR decreased by 25.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of very tight cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year-over-year RevPAR decreases. International company-operated house profit margins declined by 270 basis points, and HP-PAR at our International managed properties decreased by 22.0 percent reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. North American company-operated house profit margins declined by 440 basis points, and HP-PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 27.7 percent also reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. HP-PAR at our North American Limited-Service managed properties decreased by 28.7 percent, reflecting cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. Lodging Development We opened 154 properties, totaling 28,114 rooms, across our brands in 2010 and 31 properties (6,072 rooms) left the system, not including residential products or ExecuStay. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) left the system. Highlights of the year included: • Converting 23 properties (3,660 rooms), or 13 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to one of our brands including 11 properties joining our Autograph Collection brand. Twenty-two of the properties converted were located in the United States; • Opening approximately 28 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; • Adding 102 properties (12,030 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; • Opening three new Marriott Vacation Club properties, one in Singer Island, Florida, one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Kauai, Hawaii. We also opened one Ritz-Carlton Destination Club property in Vail, Colorado; and • Opening our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii (353 rooms). We currently have nearly 105,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 35,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2011. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties, so such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). 37 Table of Contents Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2010 include the 52 weeks from January 2, 2010, through December 31, 2010, for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010, and for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 38 Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2010 Change vs. 2009 2010 Change vs. 2009 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 69.1 % 3.0 % pts. 66.5 % 3.5 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Segment revenues $ 5,108 $ 4,848 $ 5,631 5 % -14 % Segment results $ 318 $ 272 $ 419 17 % -35 % 2010 Compared to 2009 In 2010, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment we added 20 properties (7,591 rooms) and 5 properties (1,541 rooms) left the system. In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American Full-Service properties increased by 4.3 percent to $106.95, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.8 percentage points to 68.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.1 percent to $155.60. The $46 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $7 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and unit growth as well as franchise fees from new properties added to the Autograph Collection. The $10 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins. The $7 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to stronger results driven by higher RevPAR and property-level margins. The $7 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected favorable variances from an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property, a $7 million charge for a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009, and a $3 million reversal of a completion guarantee accrual because we satisfied the related guarantee release requirements in 2010. These favorable variances were partially offset by $7 million in net 2010 other cost increases, primarily reflecting incentive compensation, as well as a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter because we expect that a management agreement associated with one property will likely be terminated early in 2011 in conjunction with a change in property ownership. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,575 million in 2010, compared to $4,322 million in 2009. 44 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (3,645 rooms) and 3 properties (800 rooms) left the system. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American Full-Service properties decreased by 17.0 percent to $103.87, occupancy decreased by 4.3 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.6 percent to $157.10. The $147 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $71 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, a $15 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $3 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in gains and other income. The $71 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls. Fifty-one properties paid incentive fees in 2009 compared to 101 in 2008. The $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was primarily driven by lower RevPAR. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, decreased $15 million and primarily reflected $18 million of net losses in 2009 associated with several properties with weak demand, partially offset by a favorable variance of $3 million related to a property that was being renovated, and as a result was not operating at full capacity during 2008. The $4 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with one property that was sold for a loss in the 2008 period. The $3 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property and a $7 million impairment charge related to a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information), which were mostly offset by $12 million in cost reductions. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,322 million in 2009, compared to $4,951 million in 2008. North American Limited-Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay.

The majority of the properties that left the system were Residence Inn properties of poor quality. In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American Limited-Service properties increased by 3.5 percent to $71.51, occupancy for these properties increased by 3.6 percentage points to 67.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 2.0 percent to $106.59. The $33 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $33 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $4 million of increased joint venture equity losses, $4 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower gains and other income. 45 Table of Contents The $33 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR and new unit growth. The $2 million increase in incentive management fees was due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins. The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a net $31 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge in 2010 and $9 million of other cost increases primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. See Footnote No. 8, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010. The $4 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected an impairment charge associated with one joint venture. The $2 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividends from one joint venture due to a decline in available cash flow. The $4 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,547 million in 2010, compared to $1,419 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 207 properties (24,346 rooms) and 4 properties (588 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were mainly franchised hotels associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American Limited-Service properties decreased by 20.0 percent to $68.83, occupancy for these properties decreased by 5.8 percentage points to 63.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 12.7 percent to $108.33. The $130 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected $59 million of lower base management and franchise fees, $35 million of lower incentive management fees, $17 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $9 million of lower joint venture equity earnings, $6 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $59 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was largely due to lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR, partially offset by new unit growth. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins resulting from weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls. Twenty-three properties paid incentive fees in 2009, compared to 256 in 2008. The $17 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million in lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties and $6 million of lower property-level margins associated with our corporate housing business. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected equity losses at one of our joint ventures as the related properties experienced weak demand. The $4 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $42 million impairment charge related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, mostly offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information). The net increase of $16 million associated with the 2008 accrual and 2009 impairment charge was partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily reflecting cost reductions that were part of our cost containment efforts. The $6 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividend distributions in the current year from one joint venture, which had a decline in available cash flow as a result of the weak demand environment. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,419 million in 2009, compared to $1,541 million in 2008. 46 Table of Contents International Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the continental United States and Canada.

In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 9.4 percent to $117.38, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.8 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.3 percent to $166.93. Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in China, Brazil and Germany and, to a lesser extent, in France and the United Kingdom, while the United Arab Emirates experienced RevPAR declines. The $40 million increase in segment results in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily reflected a $13 million increase in incentive management fees, a $9 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $5 million increase in gains and other income, a $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, and a $2 million decrease in restructuring costs. The $13 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that favorably impacted house profit margins, and to a lesser extent new unit growth. The $9 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and new unit growth, partially offset by increased currency exchange losses. The $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million of stronger results at some owned and leased properties, and $7 million of higher termination fees partially offset by $12 million of additional rent expense associated with one property. The $5 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with a net gain associated with the sale of two properties in 2010. The $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased earnings at our joint ventures, resulting from stronger property-level performance, and a favorable variance from a $3 million impairment charge recorded for one joint venture in 2009. The $2 million decrease in restructuring costs primarily reflects a favorable variance from a $2 million severance and fringe benefit charge recorded in 2009 during our restructuring efforts. See Footnote No. 19, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International Lodging segment properties totaled $581 million in 2010, compared to $529 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our International Lodging segment, we added 30 properties (8,734 rooms) and 8 properties (1,714 rooms) left the system, largely due to quality issues. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties decreased by 18.0 percent to $108.45, occupancy for these properties decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 66.3 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.9 percent to $163.64. RevPAR declined in most markets around the world. The $117 million decrease in segment results in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $45 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million decrease in gains and other income, a decrease of $9 million in joint venture equity earnings, and $2 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses. 47 Table of Contents The $45 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level margins, driven by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable currency exchange rates compared to 2008, partially offset by property-level cost controls. The $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was driven mainly by lower RevPAR, impacted by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable currency exchange rates, somewhat offset by the impact of new room additions. The $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $23 million of weaker results, driven by weak demand and lower RevPAR at some owned and leased properties, $13 million of lower termination fees, and $3 million of lower income reflecting conversions from leased properties to managed properties. The $8 million decrease in gains and other income reflected miscellaneous gain activity in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. Restructuring costs totaling $2 million reflected severance and fringe benefit costs. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to our 2009 Form 10-K for more information. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings was primarily driven by a $3 million impairment charge and $12 million in lower equity results at three joint ventures primarily reflecting lower demand. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information on the joint venture impairment. The decrease also reflected an $11 million unfavorable impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures in 2008. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $15 million in cost reductions due to our cost containment efforts, partially offset by $3 million in guarantee reserves for two properties. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $529 million in 2009, compared to $707 million in 2008.

In 2010, we also added 3 residential products (441 units) and 1 product (25 units) left the system. Compared to 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 10.2 percent to $193.17, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.9 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.4 percent to $292.11. While Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business in 2009, that business improved in 2010. The $60 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, reflected a $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $8 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $7 million increase in base management fees, and a $3 million increase in incentive management fees. The $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $30 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired. The $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $6 million favorable variance from improved operating performance at three properties, as well as $4 million of higher branding fees primarily from one property, and $2 million of termination fees net of property closing costs, all in 2010. The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual for which we satisfied the related requirements and a $4 million favorable variance from 48 Table of Contents bad debt expense recorded in 2009 on an accounts receivable balance we deemed uncollectible partially offset by $1 million in other net 2010 cost increases primarily reflecting incentive compensation. The $7 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $3 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected fees earned and due from one property in 2010 that were calculated based on prior periods’ results. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,261 million in 2010, compared to $1,143 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 5 properties (916 rooms) and 1 property (374 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added 3 residential products (453 units) in 2009. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties decreased by 22.7 percent to $175.66, occupancy for these properties decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 59.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 13.8 percent to $295.11. Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business. The $61 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected a $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, a $17 million decrease in base management fees, $13 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $6 million decrease in incentive management fees, and $5 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses. The $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired, partially offset by a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information). The $17 million decrease in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR declines associated with weaker demand. The $6 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property-level cost controls and new unit growth. The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of lower results at three properties driven by weak demand and the resulting RevPAR declines in 2009 and $6 million of lower residential branding fees. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2009 reflected $4 million in bad debt expense related to an accounts receivable balance we deemed to be uncollectible, $5 million of expenses primarily related to write-offs of other assets that we deemed non-recoverable, $3 million in start-up costs related to a new brand, and a $2 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by $9 million in cost reductions related to our cost containment efforts. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,143 million in 2009, compared to $1,350 million in 2008. 49 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands worldwide.

Timeshare segment contract sales increased by $20 million to $685 million in 2010 from $665 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a $28 million increase in residential contract sales and a $26 million increase in fractional contract sales, mostly offset by a $34 million decrease in timeshare contract sales. Sales of timeshare intervals were hurt by tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $63 million decrease in cancellation allowances we recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. The $107 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,546 million from $1,439 million in 2009 primarily reflected a $98 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $6 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and a $3 million increase in base management fees. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income associated with the impact of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards and, to a lesser extent, higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancies and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily due to tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, and a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default). 50 Table of Contents Segment income of $121 million in 2010 increased by $800 million from $679 million of segment losses in 2009, and primarily reflected a favorable variance from the $685 million of impairments recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher 2010 Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $45 million of lower restructuring costs compared with 2009, $18 million increase in gains and other income, $3 million increase in base management fees, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses partially offset by a $55 million increase in interest expense, an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest, and $5 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $116 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue net of expense, partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated previously. The $20 million unfavorable impact to development revenue related to the reserve for uncollectible accounts was partially offset by a favorable impact in product costs, resulting in a net $12 million increase in reserves. The $78 million increase in financing revenue, net of expense, primarily reflected: (1) a net $141 million increase in interest income, reflecting a $147 million increase from the notes receivable we now consolidate associated with past securitization transactions as part of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in interest income related to non-securitized notes receivable reflecting a lower outstanding balance; and (2) a favorable variance from a $20 million charge in 2009 related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests. These favorable variances were partially offset by $42 million of decreased residual interest accretion reflecting the elimination of residual interests as part of our 2010 adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $37 million of gain on notes sold in 2009, and $3 million of other net expenses. The $8 million increase in other revenue net of expense primarily reflected a $15 million favorable adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability resulting from lower than anticipated cost of redemptions, as well as $6 million of higher other miscellaneous revenue, partially offset by $13 million of net costs in excess of enrollment revenue related to the new points-based program. The $11 million increase in services revenue net of expenses primarily reflected higher rental revenue associated with increased transient demand. The $55 million in interest expense was a result of the consolidation of debt obligations due to our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. Gains and other income increased by $18 million, primarily due to the sale of one property in the 2010 fourth quarter. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the anticipated disposition of a golf course and related assets. Partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a $7 million write-off of capitalized software development costs in 2009 related to a project for which we decided not to pursue further development. For additional information regarding the impairment charge recorded in 2010, see Footnote No. 8, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Joint venture equity losses decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected higher cancellation allowances recorded at a joint venture in 2009. The $11 million decrease to zero in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interest was associated with our acquisition of that noncontrolling interest. See Footnote No. 20, “Variable Interest Entities,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. 2009 Compared to 2008 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $411 million (38 percent), compared to 2008, to $665 million from $1,076 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2009, compared to 2008, reflected a $396 million decrease in timeshare contract sales and a $22 million decrease in fractional contract sales, partially offset by $7 million of lower residential net cancellation allowances on contract sales. Sales of fractional and timeshare intervals decreased significantly as a result of weak demand, but were partially offset by a decrease in cancellation allowances of $32 million, as compared with prior year, recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information). 51 Table of Contents The $311 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,439 million from $1,750 million primarily reflected a $300 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $16 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, partially offset by a $5 million increase in base management fees. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue. Timeshare segment revenues in 2009 and 2008 included note securitization gains of $37 million and $16 million, respectively. Segment losses of $679 million in 2009 increased by $707 million from $28 million of segment income in 2008, and reflected $685 million of impairments (See Footnote No. 20, “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information on the impairments), $17 million of higher restructuring costs, $23 million in lower joint venture equity earnings, a $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, and $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $31 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of higher base management fees. The $6 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write-down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. The $43 million increase in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected: (1) a $21 million increase in note securitization gains, from $16 million in 2008, which included a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness, to $37 million in 2009, due to only one note securitization in 2008 as compared with two note securitizations in 2009; (2) $22 million of increased residual interest accretion reflecting incremental accretion from the second quarter 2008, first quarter 2009, and fourth quarter 2009 note securitizations; (3) a $12 million decrease in the charge that reduced the valuation of residual interests to $20 million in 2009 from $32 million in 2008; and (4) a $13 million decrease in the cost of financing due to cost containment efforts. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $22 million of lower interest income because of lower notes receivable balances in 2009 due to the completion of the 2009 second and fourth quarter note securitizations; and $5 million of lower settlement revenue, net of expenses, due to lower settlement volume. The $20 million recorded charge for the reduced value of residual interests in 2009 consisted of a $19 million unfavorable impact for eight previously securitized pools that reached performance triggers as a result of increased defaults in 2009, partially offset by a $4 million benefit for the release of seven of the eight performance triggers later in 2009 due to improved loan performance, and a $5 million net unfavorable impact from changes in the assumptions for discount, default and prepayment rates that we used in our estimate of fair market value (see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information). The $17 million decrease in services revenue net of expenses was driven by lower rental revenue due to the weak demand and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. The $15 million increase in other revenue, net of expenses, was primarily a result of higher marketing and sales revenue. The $17 million increase in restructuring costs reflected a $24 million increase in facilities exit costs and $1 million increase in severance costs, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in development cancellations (see the “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” section of our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information). The $31 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $33 million in cost savings primarily generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions and other cost reductions and a $4 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008, partially offset by a $7 million 2009 write-off of capitalized software development costs related to a project for which we have decided not to pursue further development. See Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information on the write-off of capitalized software costs. Joint venture equity earnings decreased by $23 million and primarily reflected decreased earnings from a joint venture, attributable to weak 2009 demand for a residential and fractional project. 52 Table of Contents The $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to a $12 million noncontrolling interest benefit recorded in 2008 related to an impairment of a joint venture we consolidate. MARRIOTT VACATION CLUB DESTINATIONS TIMESHARE PROGRAM During our 2010 third quarter, we launched the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (the “MVCD Program”) in North America and the Caribbean. Under the MVCD Program, we sell beneficial interests in a domestic land trust. Based on the number of beneficial interests purchased, MVCD members receive an annual allocation of Vacation Club Points to redeem for travel at numerous destinations. Although the existing rights and privileges of owners of weeks-based intervals are unchanged, those owners now also have the option of enrolling in the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Exchange Program, which affords them the opportunity to trade their weeks-based intervals for Vacation Club Points usage each year, as well as to purchase additional product in increments of less than one week. Since the MVCD Program is a significant change from our prior approach to the timeshare business, we have focused our marketing efforts on existing owners, to encourage participation and purchase of additional product. Early results have exceeded our expectations. We believe the MVCD Program will appeal to a broader demographic than our prior weeks-based program by providing our owners with more flexible usage options, including the use of points for tailored vacation experiences, and by allowing us to sell our resort system at all locations, including those where few or no weeks were still available. We expect that the MVCD Program will result in fewer resorts under construction at any given time and allow us to better leverage successful sales centers at completed resorts. With less invested in inventory, the MVCD Program also should allow us to improve returns on investment. Revenue recognition for the MVCD Program follows our Timeshare Points-Based Use System revenue recognition policy (see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements). The timing of revenue recognition for this program approximates contract sales because we expect to sell fully completed inventory for the foreseeable future. With more efficient inventory management, we expect to have lower unsold maintenance fee expense, which should enhance profitability over time. In addition to capitalized costs for internally developed software and licensing fees of $14 million, we incurred costs for the MVCD Program in 2010 of approximately $20 million (which included $12 million of start-up costs). Costs in excess of enrollment revenue for the new points-based program totaled $13 million and is reflected in our Income Statement in Timeshare sales and service, net of direct expenses. Given the amount of inventory we have, we do not expect to develop new timeshare resorts in the near term. PROPOSED SPIN-OFF OF TIMESHARE OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS On February 14, 2011, we announced a plan to split the company’s businesses into two separate, publicly traded companies. Under the plan, we expect to spin off our timeshare operations and development business as a new independent company through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders in late 2011. Please see Footnote No. 24, “Subsequent Event,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel Prior to 2008 we operated four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under IRC Section 45K were not available for coal-based synthetic fuels produced or sold after calendar year 2007, and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we shut down the Facilities in our 2007 fourth quarter and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, “Discontinued Operations - Synthetic Fuel,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding our former Synthetic Fuel segment. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Appreciation Program”); (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 53 Table of Contents During 2010, we granted 3.8 million RSUs and 1.1 million Employee SARs. See Footnote No. 4, “Share-Based Compensation,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards in 2010 and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Our Credit Facility, which expires on May 14, 2012, and associated letters of credit, provide for $2.4 billion of aggregate effective borrowings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread based on the credit ratings for our public debt. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. Although our Credit Facility does not expire until 2012, we expect that we may extend or replace it during 2011. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future. We believe the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations and our ability to raise capital, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year-end 2010, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2.831 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.326 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $505 million. We calculate that borrowing capacity by taking $2.404 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility. During 2010, we repaid our outstanding Credit Facility borrowings and had no outstanding balance at year-end. As noted in the previous paragraphs, we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash from operations $ 1,151 $ 868 $ 641 Depreciation expense 138 151 155 Amortization expense 40 34 35 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2010 and 1.2 to 1.0 at year-end 2009. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. 54 Table of Contents Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2.9x * 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million. Timeshare Cash Flows. In conjunction with our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the 2010 first quarter, as discussed in more detail in Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements we no longer account for note receivable securitizations as sales, but rather as secured borrowings as defined in the new standards, and accordingly did not recognize gains or losses on the 2010 notes receivable securitization nor do we expect to recognize gains or losses on future note receivable securitizations. As part of our adoption of the new standards, we classify the following 2010 activities as “Financing Activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: (1) payments on the newly recorded debt obligations as repayments of long-term debt ($231 million); (2) note repurchases (classified in “Timeshare activity, net” under “Operating Activities” for 2009 and 2008) as repayments of long-term debt ($93 million); and (3) proceeds on any note securitizations as issuance of long-term debt ($215 million) (classified in “Timeshare activity, net” under “Operating Activities” for 2009 and 2008). Also, we no longer have any cash flow activity related to residual interests or servicing assets. We will continue to classify any collections on held notes receivable, as well as the notes receivable we reestablished in the 2010 first quarter associated with past securitization transactions, as “Timeshare activity, net” in “Operating Activities.” In response to lower demand for our Timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new Timeshare development. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). In 2010, 2009, and 2008, new Timeshare segment mortgages were $256 million, $302 million, and $747 million, respectively, and collections totaled $347 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $230 million), $155 million, and $222 million, respectively. ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Timeshare segment development less than (in excess of) cost of sales $ 15 $ (4 ) $ (299 ) Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages) 91 (147 ) (525 ) Note repurchases 0 (81 ) (56 ) Financially reportable sales less than closed sales 58 29 126 Note securitization gains 0 (37 ) (16 ) Note securitization proceeds 0 349 237 Collection on retained interests in securitized notes and servicing fees 0 82 102 Other cash inflows (outflows) 52 (45 ) 33 Net cash inflows (outflows) from Timeshare segment activity $ 216 $ 146 $ (398 ) See Footnote No. 13, “Long-term Debt,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the failure of some Timeshare securitized notes receivable pools to perform within established parameters and the resulting redirection of cash flows. In 2010, seven securitized notes receivable pools reached performance triggers in different months throughout the year as a result of increased defaults. As of year-end 2010, of the seven pools out of compliance during 2010, loan performance had improved sufficiently in six pools to cure the performance triggers, leaving one pool out of compliance. Approximately $6 million of cash flows in 2010 and $17 million of cash flows in 2009 were redirected as a result of reaching the performance triggers for those years. None of our pools experienced performance triggers in 2008, so no cash flow was redirected during that year. On November 12, 2010, we securitized a pool of approximately $229 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2010-1 Trust”). Simultaneous with the securitization, investors purchased approximately $218 million in Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2010-1 Trust in a private placement in two classes. Class A Notes totaling approximately $195 million with an interest rate of 3.54 percent and Class B Notes totaling approximately $23 million with an interest rate of 4.52 percent. As consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $215 million, net of costs, and a subordinated residual interest in the 2010-1 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. Under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, we accounted for this transaction as a secured borrowing in 2010 and we did not record a gain or loss. 55 Table of Contents On October 20, 2010, we exercised our option for the Term 2002 transaction to repurchase all outstanding collateral, payoff and redeem all outstanding bonds, and terminate the associated trust, which resulted in cash outflows from the Company of approximately $25 million. On March 9, 2009, we completed a private placement of approximately $205 million of floating-rate Timeshare Loan Backed Notes with a bank-administered commercial paper conduit. We contributed approximately $284 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the securitization of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2009-1 Trust”). On the same day, the 2009-1 Trust issued approximately $205 million of the 2009-1 Trust’s notes. In connection with the private placement of notes receivable, we received proceeds of approximately $181 million, net of costs, and retained $94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity, which included $81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and $13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip. We measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer. We recorded the notes that we effectively owned after the transfer as notes receivable. In connection with this March 2009 note securitization, we recorded a $1 million loss, which we included in the “Timeshare sales and services” line item in our Income Statement. On October 21, 2009, we securitized a pool of approximately $380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2009-2 Trust”). Simultaneous with the securitization, investors purchased $317 million of 4.809 percent Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2009-2 Trust in a private placement. As part of this transaction, we paid off the notes that the 2009-1 Trust issued in March 2009 and reacquired approximately $233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 2009-1 Trust. We included approximately $218 million of these reacquired loans in the October 21, 2009 securitization. As consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 2009-2 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. These cash proceeds are net of approximately $145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction. In connection with this October 2009 note securitization, we recorded a $38 million gain, which we included in the “Timeshare sales and services” line item in our Income Statement. On June 10, 2008, we securitized to a newly formed special purpose entity (the “2008-1 Trust”) $300 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. On the same day, the 2008-1 Trust issued $246 million of the 2008-1 Trust’s notes. In connection with the securitization of notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million. We retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of $93 million. We recorded note securitization gains totaling $16 million in 2008, which was net of a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness which we included in the “Timeshare sales and services” line item in our Income Statement. We had residual interests of $214 million at year-end 2009, which we recorded in the accompanying Balance Sheet as other long-term receivables of $144 million and other current assets of $70 million. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which we measured at year-end 2009 using Level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy (which we described in our 2009 Form 10-K in Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements”), accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year-end 2009 that were required to be measured at fair value using the then applicable fair value measurement guidance. We treated the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Income Statements. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded trading gains of $18 million and losses of $9 million, respectively. See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on residual interests eliminated as part of the adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the first quarter of 2010. For additional information on our timeshare note securitizations, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, see Footnote No. 12, “Asset Securitizations,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. See also Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Footnote No. 20, “Variable Interest Entities,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for the impact of adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2011 through 2030, the cash flow associated with completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $2.8 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which remain subject to change. 56 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $307 million in 2010, $147 million in 2009, and $357 million in 2008 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which we include in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures increased primarily due to our purchase of two hotel properties in 2010. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $114 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009, and $38 million in 2008. Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Collections and sales for such loans, net of advances during 2010 and 2009, amounted to net loan advances of $6 million in 2010 and net loan advances of $45 million in 2009. At year-end 2010, we had no senior loans and $191 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $7 million) outstanding, compared with $1 million in senior loans (including a current portion of $1 million) and $195 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $95 million) outstanding at year-end 2009. In 2010, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. See the “Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans” caption in Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $29 million in 2010, $28 million in 2009, and $25 million in 2008 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $531 million in 2010, to $2,829 million at year-end 2010 from $2,298 million at year-end 2009, and reflected consolidation (in conjunction with our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards) of debt with a balance at year-end 2010 of $1,016 million, partially offset by decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility of $425 million and other net debt decreases of $60 million. Debt decreased by $797 million in 2009, to $2,298 million at year-end 2009 from $3,095 million at year-end 2008, and reflected a $544 million decrease in borrowings under our Credit Facility, the repayment, upon maturity, of $79 million (including interest) of Series C Senior Notes in 2009, the repurchase of $119 million in book value ($122 million in principal amount) of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $57 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2010, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 5.6 percent and an average maturity of approximately 8.9 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.99 to 1.0 at year-end 2010. See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional information on our Credit Facility. During 2010, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, which had a balance outstanding at year-end 2009 of $425 million. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. In 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment 57 Table of Contents representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We purchased 1.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2010 at an average price of $39.02 per share, did not purchase any shares in 2009, and purchased 11.9 million shares in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share. On November 4, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 4 million additional shares, bringing the total outstanding purchase authorization on that date to approximately 25 million shares. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year-end 2010, 23.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per share on April 9, May 7, and August 5, 2010, respectively, and a cash dividend of $0.0875 per share on November 4, 2010.

The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2010 of $39 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we do not anticipate that those audits will have a significant impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the next 52 weeks, it remains possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over that time period. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year-end 2010: Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 199 $ 33 $ 59 $ 50 $ 57 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 185 43 87 29 26 Total guarantee commitments $ 384 $ 76 $ 146 $ 79 $ 83 In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided two project completion guarantees in favor of lenders: • A guarantee with an estimated aggregate total cost of $592 million, and a $16 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year-end 2010, as further discussed in Footnote No. 20, “Variable Interest Entities,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements; and • A guarantee with an estimated aggregate total cost of Canadian $491 million ($491 million), and a $3 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year-end 2010. During 2010, our joint venture partners executed documents indemnifying us for any payments that may be required in connection with this guarantee. 58 Table of Contents For additional information on these project completion guarantees, including our pro rata ownership percentages in the associated entities, as well as additional information on our guarantees, including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into, see the “Guarantees” caption within Footnote No. 16, “Contingencies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner. We also had the following other commitments, including loan and investment commitments, outstanding at year-end 2010: Loan and Investment Commitments Amount of Loan and Investment Commitments Expected Funding By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 Years Total loan commitments $ 1 $ 0 $ 1 $ 0 $ 0 Total investment commitments 129 95 3 31 0 Total other commitments $ 130 $ 95 $ 4 $ 31 $ 0 For further information on our loan and investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments and Letters of Credit” caption within Footnote No. 16, “Contingencies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. At year-end 2010, we also had $81 million of letters of credit outstanding ($78 million under our Credit Facility and $3 million outside the Credit Facility), the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2010 totaled $219 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 49 percent. For other information regarding these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 22, “Related Party Transactions,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on: 59 Table of Contents Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to these programs; Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill; Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets; Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures; Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies; Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; Loan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2010, our investments had a fair value of $18 million. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2010, our Balance Sheet included a $1 million liability for currency exchange derivatives and a $1 million liability for interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments. Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information associated with derivative instruments. 60 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2010 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

If we cannot attract and retain talented associates, our business could suffer. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop, and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses.Delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our Board of Directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts. Under the Delaware business combination statute, a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without Board of Director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, among other things, require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our Board of Directors could, without stockholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a stockholder’s rights plan.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.Item 2.Properties.Company-operated properties are described in Part I, Item 1. “Business,” earlier in this report. We believe our properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements. Most of our regional offices and reservation centers, both domestically and internationally, are located in leased facilities. We also lease space in a number of buildings with combined space of approximately 1.1 million square feet in Maryland where our corporate and Ritz-Carlton headquarters are located.Item 3. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including adjustments proposed during governmental examinations of the various tax returns we file. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWUnder numerous brand names in 73 countries and territories, we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels, corporate housing properties, and timeshare properties. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. At year-end 2011, our system was comprised of 3,718 properties (643,196 rooms). The figures in the preceding sentence include 32 home and condominium products (3,838 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,166 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. At year-end 2011, our operations are grouped into four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. On November 21, 2011 (""the spin-off date""), we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (""MVW""). In connection with the spin-off, we entered into several agreements with MVW, and, in some cases, certain of its subsidiaries, that govern our post-spin-off relationship with MVW, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement and two License Agreements for the use of Marriott and Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property. Under license agreements with us, MVW is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under The Ritz-Carlton brand. We receive license fees under these license agreements.Because of our significant continuing involvement in MVW future operations (by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and MVW), our former Timeshare segment's historical financial results prior to the spin-off date will continue to be included in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Please see Footnote No. 17, “Spin-off,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors; Other Risks” for additional information. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also earn fees from credit card endorsements, the sale of branded residential real estate, and licensing the Marriott timeshare and fractional and Ritz-Carlton fractional brands to MVW. Prior to the spin-off of our Timeshare business, we also generated revenues from the following sources: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals, all of which we included in our Timeshare segment.We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences). Residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.Lodging Conditions for our lodging business improved in 2011 reflecting generally low supply growth, a more favorable economic climate in most developed markets around the world, albeit at a generally low growth rate, and stronger economic growth in emerging markets, strong unit growth, and the impact of operating efficiencies across our company. While economic growth in Europe slowed in the later part of 2011 and the level of economic growth is uncertain in the United States, we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control our costs. In 2011, as compared to 2010, worldwide average daily rates increased 3.4 percent on a constant dollar basis to $133.26 for comparable systemwide properties, with RevPAR increasing 6.4 percent to $92.69 and occupancy increasing 2.0 percentage points to 69.6 percent.For properties in North America in 2011, markets in the West reflected strong demand, while properties in the East and South reflected more moderate demand. In Washington, D.C., a shorter Congressional calendar and government spending concerns reduced lodging demand. For properties in China and Brazil, demand was particularly strong during 2011, while for properties in Europe, demand was more moderate reflecting the financial crisis and related economic concerns. Demand at properties in the Middle East remained weak reflecting continued unrest in that region, and demand outside of the more metropolitan regions in Britain remained weak as a result of government austerity measures. While demand in Japan was weak in the first quarter of 2011 reflecting the impact of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, domestic demand began to 24Table of Contentsimprove in the 2011 second quarter and continued throughout the rest of 2011, but remained below 2010 levels. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010 and that improvement continued in 2011, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates.The hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers. Overall, business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2011, while group demand continues to improve. Group customers typically book rooms and meeting space with significant lead times, sometimes several years in advance of guest arrival. Typically, two-thirds of group business is booked prior to the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. During an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. Group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off, and with improving group demand, is being replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates.Negotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented 14 percent of our full-service hotel room nights for 2011 in North America. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. For 2012, we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business clients in the first quarter, and we expect rates to be higher than the prior year. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property-level cost saving initiatives regarding menus and restaurant hours, room amenities, cross-training personnel, and utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible. We also control above-property costs, which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we continue to require (where legally permitted) or encourage employees to use their vacation time accrued during the year.Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We also remove hotels from our system that no longer meet our standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We completed the roll out of our sales deployment strategy in 2011, which aligns our sales efforts around customer needs, reducing duplication of sales efforts, and enabling coverage for a larger number of accounts. We now have the systems, training, and incentives for sales associates to sell our represented hotels as a portfolio rather than solely on a hotel-by-hotel basis. Our largest properties continue to have sales staff assigned on property. In 2011, we also implemented innovative technology solutions, including our Retail Pricing Optimizer tool (""RPO"") and our High Performance Pricing tool (""HPP""). RPO determines optimal transient retail (benchmark) rates for hotels using an analytically-driven and market-based methodology. We believe this technology provides a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increases efficiency in analysis and decision making, and produces increased property level revenue for transient retail and associated segments. HPP enables hotels to more effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes using web-based functionality. The streamlined process provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2011, we operated 44 percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, we owned or leased 2 percent, and 1 percent were operated or franchised through unconsolidated joint ventures. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make.We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in 25Table of Contentsroom revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Constant dollar statistics are calculated by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Timeshare As noted previously, on November 21, 2011, we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary MVW. In preparing our former Timeshare segment to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following the spin-off of the stock of MVW management assessed the Timeshare segment's intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets. On September 8, 2011, management approved a plan for our former Timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land and excess built luxury inventory. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after-tax) in our 2011 Income Statement under the ""Timeshare strategy-impairment charges"" caption. We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption ""Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges"" later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section. Also see the ""Timeshare"" caption later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section, for additional information on the results of operations.CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2011, 2010, and 2009. The results for 2011 include the results of the former Timeshare segment prior to the spin-off date while 2010 and 2009 included the former Timeshare segment for the entire fiscal year. See the Timeshare segment discussion later in this report for additional information.Revenues 2011 Compared to 2010Revenues increased by $626 million (5 percent) to $12,317 million in 2011 from $11,691 million in 2010, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($604 million); base management and franchise fees ($105 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($37 million); and incentive management fees ($13 million (all from properties outside of North America)). These favorable variances were partially offset by lower Timeshare sales and services revenue ($133 million).The increases in base management fees, to $602 million in 2011 from $562 million in 2010, and in franchise fees, to $506 million in 2011 from $441 million in 2010, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. Base management fees in 2011 included $51 million associated with the timeshare business compared to $55 million in the prior year. Franchise fees in 2011 included $4 million associated with MVW license fees. The increase in incentive management fees from $182 million in 2010 to $195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and continued property-level cost controls and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates.The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,083 million in 2011, from $1,046 million in 2010, reflected $21 million of higher total branding fees, $7 million of higher corporate housing revenue, $4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $99 million and $78 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,088 million in 2011, from $1,221 million in 2010, primarily 26Table of Contentsreflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue, which primarily reflected the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates prior to the spin-off date. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,843 million in 2011 from $8,239 million in 2010, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system.2010 Compared to 2009Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million).The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment.The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth.The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property-level costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010.Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges 2011 ChargesIn preparing our former Timeshare segment to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following our spin-off of the stock of MVW (see Footnote No. 17, ""Spin-off"" for additional information), management assessed the Timeshare segment's intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets. On September 8, 2011, management approved a plan for the Timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land in the U.S., Mexico, and the Bahamas over the next 18 to 24 months and to accelerate sales of excess built luxury fractional and residential inventory over the next three years. As a result, in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, because the nominal cash flows from the planned land sales and the estimated fair values of the land and excess built luxury inventory were less than their respective carrying values, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after-tax) in our 2011 Income 27Table of ContentsStatement under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption. 2009 ChargesIn 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Income Statement ($502 million after-tax), including $614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption, and $138 million of pretax charges that impacted non-operating income under the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non-cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments.For additional information related to the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges, including how these impairments were determined, the impairment charges grouped by product type and/or geographic location, and a table showing the composition of the charges, see Footnote No. 18, “Timeshare Strategy - Impairment Charges.”Restructuring Costs and Other Charges As part of the restructuring actions we began in 2008, we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our former Timeshare segment, hotel development, above-property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on the 2009 restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, please see Footnote No. 21, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. For the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception, please see Footnote No. 19, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.As a result of our restructuring efforts, we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010 and 2009, respectively, which were primarily reflected in our Income Statement under the expense captions noted: (i) $113 million ($73 million after-tax) and $80 million to $85 million ($48 million to $52 million after-tax) for our former Timeshare segment, under “Timeshare-direct” and “General, administrative, and other”; (ii) $12 million ($8 million after-tax) and $9 million ($5 million after-tax) for hotel development across several of our Lodging segments, primarily under “General, administrative, and other”; and (iii) $10 million ($8 million after-tax) and $8 million ($5 million after-tax) for reducing above property-level lodging management personnel under “General, administrative, and other.”Operating Income (Loss)2011 Compared to 2010Operating income decreased by $169 million to $526 million in 2011 from $695 million in 2010. The decrease reflected Timeshare strategy-impairment charges of $324 million recorded in 2011 and $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $105 million increase in base management and franchise fees, $49 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $28 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, and $13 million of higher incentive management fees. We address the reasons for the increases in base management and franchise fees and in incentive management fees as compared to 2010 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $49 million (54 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $21 million of higher branding fees, $15 million of net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property-level margins, $6 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, net of 2010 termination costs, $6 million of higher corporate housing and other revenue, net of expenses, and $5 million of decreased rent expense, partially offset by $4 million of lower results at a leased hotel in Japan that experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $28 million (4 percent) to $752 million in 2011 from $780 million in 2010. The decrease primarily reflected favorable variances from the following items recorded in 2010: an $84 million long-lived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a $13 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our former Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment). Also contributing to the decrease in expenses, was $9 million of lower former Timeshare segment expenses due to the spin-off and a $5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision related to one property with increased expected future cash flows. These favorable variances were partially offset by the following items recorded in 2011: $34 million of transaction-related expenses associated with the spin-off of the timeshare business; $17 million of higher compensation costs; $10 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets and initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, a $5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related 28Table of Contentsto one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; a $5 million performance cure payment for a North American Full-Service property; and $7 million related to an increase in the guarantee reserves for one International and one North American Full-Service property, primarily due to cash flow shortfalls at the properties, and a $2 million write-off of contract acquisition costs associated with two other properties. Unfavorable variances from a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States and a $6 million reversal of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, both recorded in 2010, further offset the aforementioned favorable variances. The $28 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses consisted of a $34 million decrease that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $22 million decrease allocated to our former Timeshare segment; and a $12 million decrease allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment; partially offset by a $20 million increase allocated to our Luxury segment; a $15 million increase allocated to our International segment; and a $5 million increase allocated to our North American Full-Service segment.Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses totaled $159 million in 2011 and $199 million in 2010. The decrease of $40 million as compared to 2010, primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in the prior year and, to a lesser extent in the current year reflected the impact of the spin-off as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin-off as well as lower notes receivable balances prior to the spin-off date. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin-off. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment prior to spin-off.2010 Compared to 2009Operating income increased by $847 million to operating income of $695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of $152 million in 2009. The increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of $614 million related to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $51 million decrease in restructuring costs, $28 million of higher incentive management fees, and $23 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $58 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. We note the reasons for the increase of $73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of $28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding “Revenues” section.Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled $199 million. The increase of $116 million as compared to 2009, primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding “Revenues” section. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment prior to spin-off.The $23 million (34 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs, $8 million of higher branding fees, a $4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010, and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property-level margins, partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $58 million (8 percent) to $780 million in 2010 from $722 million in 2009. The increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges: an $84 million long-lived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a 29Table of Contents$13 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our former Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment). See Footnote No. 7, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on these three impairment charges. In addition, we recorded a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge (allocated to our North American Full-Service segment) in 2010. See the North American Full-Service segment discussion for additional information on this impairment charge. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase was $35 million of higher compensation costs, $14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally, $7 million of increased currency exchange losses, and $2 million of increased legal expenses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an $8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, and a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States. In addition, the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010: $49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by an $11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls; a $7 million write-off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. The year-over-year comparison also reflected a $15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses (with changes to our deferred compensation plan, general, administrative, and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred compensation impact, compared with $15 million of mark-to-market valuation expenses in 2009). The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010, compared with a $43 million provision in 2009, which reflected $29 million associated with one Luxury segment project and $14 million associated with a North American Limited-Service segment portfolio.The $58 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses was comprised of: a $77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $5 million increase allocated to our former Timeshare segment; an $8 million decrease allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment; an $8 million decrease allocated to our Luxury segment; a $7 million decrease allocated to our North American Full-Service segment; and a $1 million decrease allocated to our International segment.(Losses) Gains and Other Income (Expense)We show our (losses) gains and other income for 2011, 2010, and 2009 in the following table: ($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Gain on debt extinguishment$— $— $21Gains on sales of real estate and other11 34 10Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments$— $1 $3Income from cost method joint ventures— — 2Impairment of equity securities(18) — (5) $(7) $35 $312011 Compared to 2010The $23 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from an $18 million gain on the sale of one Timeshare segment property in 2010. The $18 million impairment of equity securities in 2011 reflects an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 4, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” 2010 Compared to 2009We did not extinguish any debt in 2010. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the $98 million purchase price and the $119 million net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K.30Table of ContentsInterest Expense2011 Compared to 2010Interest expense decreased by $16 million (9 percent) to $164 million in 2011 compared to $180 million in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by: (1) a $12 million decrease in interest expense on securitized notes, which reflected the transfer of these notes to MVW on the spin-off date, as well as a lower average outstanding balance and a lower average interest rate on those notes prior to the spin-off date; (2) a $2 million increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects; and (3) a $1 million decrease in interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, which reflected lower interest rates. See the “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” caption later in this report for additional information on our credit facility.2010 Compared to 2009Interest expense increased by $62 million (53 percent) to $180 million in 2010 compared to $118 million in 2009. This increase was driven by: (1) the consolidation of $1,121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes, which resulted in a $55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt; (2) a $14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects; and (3) $12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan. These increases were partially offset by: (1) $12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of $122 million of principal amount of our Senior Notes in 2009, the maturity of our Series C Senior Notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions; and (2) a $7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our previous $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, which primarily reflected lower average borrowings.Interest Income and Income Tax2011 Compared to 2010Interest income decreased by $5 million (26 percent) to $14 million in 2011 compared to $19 million in 2010, primarily reflecting a $3 million decrease associated with the repayment of certain loans. Our tax provision increased by $65 million (70 percent) to a tax provision of $158 million in 2011 from a tax provision of $93 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable variance related to a prior year IRS settlement on the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that resulted in an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 and $34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write-off certain deferred tax assets that we transferred to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business. We impaired these assets because we consider it ""more likely than not"" that MVW will be unable to realize the value of those deferred tax assets. Please see Footnote No. 17, ""Spin-off"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the transaction. The increases were partially offset by lower pretax income in 2011.2010 Compared to 2009Interest income decreased by $6 million (24 percent) to $19 million in 2010, compared to $25 million in 2009, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment. The decline in interest income also reflected a $2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan.Our income tax expense increased by $158 million (243 percent) to a provision of $93 million in 2010 from a benefit of $65 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 (as compared to a pretax loss in 2009) and $14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan (there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses, compared with changes which had a $14 million favorable impact in 2009). The increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010, as 2009 reflected $52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on our treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In conjunction with that settlement, we recorded an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010. Our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a $12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years’ estimated foreign tax expense.Equity in (Losses) Earnings2011 Compared to 2010Equity in losses of $13 million in 2011 decreased by $5 million from equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 and 31Table of Contentsprimarily reflected $9 million of increased earnings at two North American Limited-Service joint ventures and one International segment joint venture, primarily due to stronger property-level performance; $8 million of lower losses for a residential and fractional project joint venture (our former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their share of the joint venture’s losses as their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010); and a favorable variance from joint venture impairment charges in 2010 of $5 million associated with our North American Limited-Service segment. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $8 million of decreased earnings at two Luxury segment joint ventures. Furthermore, in 2011 and 2010 we reversed $3 million and $11 million, respectively of the $27 million funding liability we initially recorded in the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating) caption of our 2009 Income Statement (see Footnote No. 18, ""Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements of this 10-K for additional information). The $11 million reversal in 2010 and the $3 million reversal in 2011 were both recorded based on facts and circumstances surrounding a project related to our former Timeshare segment, including continued progress on certain construction-related legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of the partners. 2010 Compared to 2009Equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 decreased by $48 million from equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a $30 million impairment charge associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments, both incurred in 2009. In the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an $11 million reversal of the $27 million funding liability initially recorded in 2009 (see preceding ""2011 Compared to 2010"" discussion). Increased earnings of $5 million for our International segment joint ventures and $3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our former Timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses. A 2010 impairment charge of $5 million associated with our North American Limited-Service segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts.Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests2010 Compared to 2009Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $7 million in 2010 to zero, compared to $7 million in 2009. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses.Net Income (Loss)2011 Compared to 2010Net income and net income attributable to Marriott decreased by $260 million (57 percent) to $198 million in 2011 from $458 million in 2010, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Marriott decreased by $0.66 per share (55 percent) to $0.55 per share from $1.21 per share in 2010. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss),” the $260 million decrease in net income compared to the prior year was due to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges ($324 million), higher income taxes ($65 million), lower gains and other income ($42 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($40 million), and lower interest income ($5 million). Higher base management and franchise fees ($105 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($49 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($28 million), lower interest expense ($16 million), higher incentive management fees ($13 million), and lower equity in losses ($5 million) partially offset these items.2010 Compared to 2009Net income of $458 million in 2010 increased by $811 million (230 percent) from a loss of $353 million in 2009, net income attributable to Marriott of $458 million in 2010 increased by $804 million (232 percent) from a loss of $346 million in 2009, and diluted income per share attributable to Marriott of $1.21 per share increased by $2.18 (225 percent) from losses of $0.97 per share in 2009. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss),” the $458 million increase in net income compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2009 ($752 million), higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($116 million), lower restructuring costs ($51 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($73 million), lower equity in losses ($48 million), higher incentive management fees ($28 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($23 million), and higher gains and other income ($4 million). These favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes ($158 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($58 million), higher interest expense ($62 million), and lower interest income ($6 million).32Table of ContentsEarnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA, a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.We also evaluate Adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects: (1) Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments (""Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments"") as if the spin-off had occurred on the first day of 2010. The Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments remove the results of our former Timeshare segment for 2011 and 2010, remove unallocated spin-off transaction costs of $34 million we incurred in 2011, and assume payment by MVW to us of estimated license fees of $60 million for 2011 and $64 million for 2010. We have also included certain corporate items not previously allocated to our former Timeshare segment in the Timeshare spin-off adjustments. For additional information on the nature of the Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments, see the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on November 21, 2011 upon completion of the spin-off; (2) an adjustment for $28 million of other charges for 2011 consisting of an $18 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities; a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related to one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; and (3) an adjustment for $98 million of other charges for 2010 consisting of an $84 million impairment charge related to a capitalized revenue management software asset and a $14 million impairment charge related to a land parcel.We discuss the second and third of these items in greater detail in the preceding ""(Losses) Gains and Other Income (Expense)"" caption and the ""2010 Compared to 2009"" heading under the ""Operating Income (Loss)"" caption, respectively. We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA to make period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting EBITDA's and Adjusted EBITDA's usefulness as comparative measures. We provide Adjusted EBITDA for illustrative and informational purposes only and this measure is not necessarily indicative of and does not purport to represent what our operating results would have been had the spin-off occurred on the first day of 2010. This information also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the spin-off.We show our 2011 and 2010 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations and reconcile those measures with Net Income in the following tables. 33Table of Contents($ in millions)As Reported 2011 Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments Other Charges 2011 Adjusted EBITDANet Income$198 $260 $17 Interest expense164 (29) — Tax provision (benefit)158 40 11 Depreciation and amortization168 (28) — Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third-party owners(15) — — Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures18 — — Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures30 — — EBITDA$721 $243 $28 $992 ($ in millions)As Reported 2010 Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments Other Charges 2010 Adjusted EBITDANet Income (Loss)$458 $(47) $(25) Interest expense180 (43) — Tax provision (benefit)93 (29) 123 Depreciation and amortization178 (35) — Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third-party owners(11) — — Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures19 (3) — Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures27 — — EBITDA$944 $(157) $98 $885 Business SegmentsWe are a diversified hospitality company with operations in four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. See Footnote No. 16, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, the reclassification of certain 2010 and 2009 segment revenues, segment financial results, and segment assets to reflect our movement of Hawaii to our North American segments from our International segment, and other information about each segment, including revenues, net income (loss) attributable to Marriott, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees, assets, and capital expenditures. In addition to the segments noted previously, on November 21, 2011 we spun off our timeshare operations and timeshare development business as a new independent company, MVW, which was formerly our Timeshare segment. See Footnote No. 16, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for historical financial results of our former Timeshare segment and Footnote No. 17, ""Spin-off"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the spin-off.34Table of ContentsAt year-end 2011, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties (excluding 2,166 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging and Timeshare Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. TotalNorth American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts322 14 336 127,826 5,244 133,070Marriott Conference Centers10 — 10 2,915 — 2,915JW Marriott21 1 22 12,140 221 12,361Renaissance Hotels78 2 80 28,880 790 29,670Renaissance ClubSport2 — 2 349 — 349Autograph Collection17 — 17 5,207 — 5,207 450 17 467 177,317 6,255 183,572North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard805 17 822 113,413 2,929 116,342Fairfield Inn & Suites667 11 678 60,392 1,234 61,626SpringHill Suites285 2 287 33,466 299 33,765Residence Inn597 17 614 72,076 2,450 74,526TownePlace Suites200 1 201 20,048 105 20,153 2,554 48 2,602 299,395 7,017 306,412International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts— 156 156 — 45,784 45,784JW Marriott— 31 31 — 11,465 11,465Renaissance Hotels— 72 72 — 22,947 22,947Autograph Collection— 5 5 — 548 548Courtyard— 91 91 — 18,377 18,377Fairfield Inn & Suites— 2 2 — 334 334Residence Inn— 3 3 — 341 341Marriott Executive Apartments— 23 23 — 3,700 3,700 — 383 383 — 103,496 103,496Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton39 39 78 11,587 11,996 23,583Bulgari Hotels & Resorts— 2 2 — 117 117EDITION— 1 1 — 78 78The Ritz-Carlton-Residential(2)29 3 32 3,509 329 3,838The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments— 4 4 — 579 579 68 49 117 15,096 13,099 28,195Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Autograph Collection— 5 5 — 350 350AC Hotels by Marriott— 80 80 — 8,371 8,371 — 85 85 — 8,721 8,721 Timeshare (3)50 14 64 10,496 2,304 12,800 Total3,122 596 3,718 502,304 140,892 643,196 (1)North American includes properties located in the United States and Canada.

These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. During that time we also added four residential properties (753 units) and no residential properties exited the system. These property additions include 80 hotels (8,371 rooms) which are operated or franchised as part of our unconsolidated joint venture with AC Hoteles, S.A. See Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for additional information about AC Hotels by Marriott.Total segment financial results decreased by $218 million (22 percent) to $765 million in 2011 from $983 million in 2010, and total segment revenues increased by $586 million to $12,197 million in 2011, a 5 percent increase from revenues of $11,611 million in 2010.The year-over-year increase in revenues included a $604 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. Total segment financial results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, a decrease of $40 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $24 million decrease in gains and other income, and a $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were: a $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,104 million in 2011 from $1,003 million in 2010, an increase of $37 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of higher incentive management fees to $195 million in 2011 from $182 million in 2010, $13 million of lower joint venture equity losses, and a $12 million decrease in interest expense. For more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss).”The $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. In 2011, 29 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 27 percent in 2010. In addition, in 2011, 67 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 65 percent in 2010.See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2010, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2011 increased by 60 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (""HP-PAR"") increased by 7.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, and the impact of tight cost controls in 2011 at properties in our system, partially offset by higher property-level compensation. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 70 basis points compared to 2010 and HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 8.1 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 6.7 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and continued tight property-level cost controls, partially offset by higher property-level compensation and the effects of RevPAR declines in the Middle East.2010 Compared to 2009We added 154 properties (28,114 rooms) and 31 properties (6,072 rooms) exited the system in 2010. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) exited the system in 2010.Total segment financial results increased by $979 million to $983 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009, and total segment revenues increased by $780 million to $11,611 million in 2010, a 7 percent increase from revenues of $10,831 million in 2009.The year-over-year increase in revenues included a $557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2009, reflected a favorable variance from $685 million of 2009 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, $614 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges” caption and $71 million of which were reported in the “Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)” caption of our Income Statements, an increase of $116 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $19 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,003 million in 2010 from $930 million in 2009, a $48 million decrease in restructuring costs, $35 million of lower joint venture equity losses, $28 million of higher incentive management fees to $182 36Table of Contentsmillion in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, an increase of $21 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $21 million increase in gains and other income. These favorable variances were partially offset by $55 million of increased interest expense and an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit. For more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income (Loss).”In 2010, 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009. In addition, in 2010, 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental United States versus 67 percent in 2009.See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2009, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated HP-PAR increased by 6.4 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand, partially offset by decreased average daily rates. North American company-operated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 3.8 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties, partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 10.6 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight property-level cost controls.Lodging Development We opened 206 properties, totaling 30,856 rooms, across our brands in 2011 and 30 properties (6,262 rooms) left the system, not including residential products or ExecuStay. We also added four residential properties (753 units) and no residential properties left the system. Highlights of the year included:•Converting 34 properties (5,615 rooms), or 18 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to one of our brands including 13 properties joining our Autograph Collection brand. Seventeen of the properties converted were located in the United States;•Becoming a partner in two new unconsolidated joint ventures formed for the operation, management and development of AC Hotels by Marriott, initially in Europe but eventually in other parts of the world. The hotels are managed by the joint ventures or franchised at the direction of the joint ventures. There were 80 AC Hotels by Marriott at year-end 2011; •Opening approximately 62 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; and•Adding 68 properties (8,379 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands.We currently have over 110,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2012.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.37Table of ContentsStatistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties, so such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties.The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics we use throughout this report for 2011 include the 52 weeks from January 1, 2011, through December 30, 2011, for 2010 include the 52 weeks from January 2, 2010, through December 31, 2010, and for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the United States, which for those properties includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 38Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2011 Change vs.2010 2011 Change vs.2010 Marriott Hotels & Resorts(2) Occupancy71.0% 0.8%pts. 68.2% 1.1%pts.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,862 million in 2011, compared to $4,587 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment we added 20 properties (7,591 rooms) and 5 properties (1,541 rooms) left the system.In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American Full-Service properties increased by 4.3 percent to $107.86, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.8 percentage points to 69.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.1 percent to $156.14.The $49 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $22 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $8 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses.The $22 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and unit growth as well as franchise fees from new properties added to the Autograph Collection. The $10 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins.The $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to stronger results driven by higher RevPAR and property-level margins.45Table of ContentsThe $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected favorable variances from an $8 million impairment charge related to the write-off of contract acquisition costs for one property, a $7 million charge for a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009, and a $3 million reversal of a completion guarantee accrual because we satisfied the related guarantee release requirements in 2010. These favorable variances were partially offset by $7 million in net 2010 other cost increases, primarily reflecting incentive compensation, as well as a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter because we expected that a management agreement associated with one property would be terminated early in 2011 in conjunction with a change in property ownership.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,587 million in 2010, compared to $4,333 million in 2009.North American Limited-Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay.

The $11 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected $5 million of increased earnings in 2011 associated with two joint ventures primarily reflecting stronger property-level performance and a $5 million impairment charge recorded in 2010 associated with another joint venture.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,687 million in 2011, compared to $1,548 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 103 properties (12,341 rooms) and 15 properties (1,556 rooms) left the system.

The $2 million increase in incentive management fees was due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins.The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a net $31 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge in 2010 and $9 million of other cost increases primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. See Footnote No. 7, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010.The $4 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected an impairment charge associated with one joint venture. The $2 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividends from one joint venture due to a decline in available cash flow.The $4 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,548 million in 2010, compared to $1,419 million in 2009.47Table of ContentsInternational Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Autograph Collection, Courtyard, AC Hotels by Marriott, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the United States and Canada.

Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in South America, India, China, Thailand, and France, while Egypt experienced RevPAR declines.The $10 million increase in segment results in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily reflected an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million increase in incentive management fees, $3 million of lower joint venture equity losses and $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $15 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of lower gains and other income.The $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected new unit growth, strong RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange rates. The $8 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth, favorable foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue at several properties, partially offset by lower property-level revenue at properties in the Middle East. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected $7 million of increased expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally and a $5 million increase in a guarantee reserve related to one property with projected cash flow shortfalls.The $5 million decrease in gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a net gain associated with the sale of two properties and one joint venture in 2010.The $3 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected decreased losses at one joint venture.The $1 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of decreased rent expense and $2 million of stronger results at one property, partially offset by $5 million of lower income related to the conversion of two properties from owned to managed.

Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in China, Brazil and Germany and, to a lesser extent, in France and the United Kingdom, while the United Arab Emirates experienced RevPAR declines.The $37 million increase in segment results in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily reflected a $13 million increase in 48Table of Contentsincentive management fees, an $8 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $5 million increase in gains and other income, a $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, and a $2 million decrease in restructuring costs.The $13 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that favorably impacted house profit margins, and to a lesser extent new unit growth. The $8 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and new unit growth, partially offset by increased currency exchange losses.The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million of stronger results at some owned and leased properties, and $7 million of higher termination fees partially offset by $12 million of additional rent expense associated with one property.The $5 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with a net gain associated with the sale of two properties in 2010.The $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased earnings at our joint ventures, resulting from stronger property-level performance, and a favorable variance from a $3 million impairment charge recorded for one joint venture in 2009.The $2 million decrease in restructuring costs primarily reflects a favorable variance from a $2 million severance and fringe benefit charge recorded in 2009 during our restructuring efforts. See Footnote No. 19, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International Lodging segment properties totaled $568 million in 2010, compared to $518 million in 2009.Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz-Carlton, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, and EDITION worldwide.

In 2011, we also added four residential products (753 units) and no residential products left the system.In 2011, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 8.5 percent to $205.04, occupancy increased by 1.2 percentage points to 66.9 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.5 percent to $306.45.The $3 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $20 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses and $8 million of increased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by an $11 million increase in base management fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $5 million increase in incentive management fees.The $20 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related to one property whose owner filed for bankruptcy in 2011, a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual, and $4 million in other cost increases in 2011.The $8 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected decreased earnings at two joint ventures.The $11 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $5 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and continued property-level cost controls, new unit growth and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange rates.49Table of ContentsThe $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $12 million in increased branding fees associated with the sale of real estate by others, partially offset by a $4 million decline in income associated with our leased property in Japan, which experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2011, compared to $1,261 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our Luxury Lodging segment we added three properties (763 rooms) and one property (349 rooms) left the segment becoming an Autograph Collection hotel. In 2010, we also added three residential products (441 units) and one product (25 units) left the system.Compared to 2009, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 10.2 percent to $193.17, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.9 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.4 percent to $292.11. While Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business in 2009, that business improved in 2010.The $60 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, reflected a $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $8 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $7 million increase in base management fees, and a $3 million increase in incentive management fees.The $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $30 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired.The $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $6 million favorable variance from improved operating performance at three properties, as well as $4 million of higher branding fees primarily from one property, and $2 million of termination fees net of property closing costs, all in 2010.The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual for which we satisfied the related requirements and a $4 million favorable variance from bad debt expense recorded in 2009 on an accounts receivable balance we deemed uncollectible, partially offset by $1 million in other net 2010 cost increases primarily reflecting incentive compensation.The $7 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $3 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected fees earned and due from one property in 2010 that were calculated based on prior periods’ results.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,261 million in 2010, compared to $1,143 million in 2009.50Table of ContentsTimeshare included Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands worldwide, prior to the spin-off.

Timeshare contract sales decreased in 2011 primarily as a result of 51Table of Contentsthe spin-off of the timeshare business resulting in fewer periods of Timeshare segment activity reflected in the 2011 fiscal year, as compared to a full fiscal year in 2010, as well as difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions in 2010 and the start-up impact of the shift from the sale of weeks-based to points-based products in the 2010 third quarter. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $19 million decrease in cancellation allowances that we recorded in 2010 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue, previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing.The $113 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,438 million from $1,551 million primarily reflected a $133 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $4 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $24 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue which primarily reflected the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates.Segment results decreased by $343 million to segment losses of $217 million in 2011 from segment income of $126 million in 2010, and primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $17 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of lower base management fees, partially offset by $22 million of lower general, administrative, and other expense, $12 million of lower interest expense, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses.The $40 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in the prior year and, to a lesser extent the impact of the spin-off in 2011 as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin-off as well as lower notes receivable balances. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin-off. Gains and other income decreased by $17 million and primarily reflected the sale of one property for a gain in 2010 and smaller gains on sales of property in 2011. Base management fees decreased by $4 million, primarily due to the spin-off. General, administrative, and other expense decreased by $22 million primarily due to a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the disposition of a golf course and related assets as well as the impact of the spin-off. For additional information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010, see Footnote No. 7, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements.Joint venture equity losses decreased by $8 million and primarily reflected lower losses from a residential and fractional project joint venture for which the former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their portion of the losses since their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010.The $12 million decrease in interest expense was a result of the transfer of the outstanding debt obligations associated with securitized notes receivable to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off, as well as lower outstanding debt obligations and lower interest rates.2010 Compared to 2009During the 2010 third quarter, we launched the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (the “MVCD Program”) in North America and the Caribbean. Under the MVCD Program, we sold beneficial interests in a domestic land trust. Based on the number of beneficial interests purchased, MVCD members received an annual allocation of Vacation Club Points to redeem for travel at numerous destinations. Although the rights and privileges, that existed at the launch of the new program for owners of weeks-based intervals were unchanged, those owners also had the option of enrolling in the MVCD Program, which afforded them the opportunity to trade their weeks-based intervals for Vacation Club Points usage each year, as well as to purchase additional product in increments of less than one week. Since the MVCD Program was a significant change from our prior approach to the timeshare business, marketing efforts initially focused on existing owners, to encourage participation and purchase of additional product.52Table of ContentsTimeshare segment contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential ownership products before the adjustment for percentage-of-completion accounting. Timeshare segment contract sales increased by $20 million to $685 million in 2010 from $665 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a $28 million increase in residential contract sales and a $26 million increase in fractional contract sales, mostly offset by a $34 million decrease in timeshare contract sales. Sales of timeshare intervals were hurt by tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $63 million decrease in cancellation allowances we recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing.The $107 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,551 million from $1,444 million in 2009 primarily reflected a $98 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $6 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and a $3 million increase in base management fees. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income associated with the impact of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards and, to a lesser extent, higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancies and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily due to tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, and a $20 million increase in reserves (we began reserving for 100 percent of notes that were in default in addition to the reserve we recorded on notes not in default).Segment income of $126 million in 2010 increased by $800 million from $674 million of segment losses in 2009, and primarily reflected a favorable variance from the $685 million of impairments recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher 2010 Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $45 million of lower restructuring costs compared with 2009, $18 million increase in gains and other income, $3 million increase in base management fees, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses partially offset by a $55 million increase in interest expense, an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest, and $5 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.The $116 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue net of expense, partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated previously. The $20 million unfavorable impact to development revenue related to the reserve for uncollectible accounts was partially offset by a favorable impact in product costs, resulting in a net $12 million increase in reserves.The $78 million increase in financing revenue, net of expense, primarily reflected: (1) a net $141 million increase in interest income, reflecting a $147 million increase from the notes receivable we consolidated in 2010 associated with past securitization transactions as part of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in interest income related to non-securitized notes receivable reflecting a lower outstanding balance; and (2) a favorable variance from a $20 million charge in 2009 related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests. These favorable variances were partially offset by $42 million of decreased residual interest accretion reflecting the elimination of residual interests as part of our 2010 adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $37 million of gain on notes sold in 2009, and $3 million of other net expenses.The $8 million increase in other revenue net of expense primarily reflected a $15 million favorable adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability resulting from lower than anticipated cost of redemptions, as well as $6 million of higher other miscellaneous revenue, partially offset by $13 million of net costs in excess of enrollment revenue related to the MVCD Program. The $11 million increase in services revenue net of expenses primarily reflected higher rental revenue associated with increased transient demand.The $55 million in interest expense was a result of the consolidation of debt obligations due to our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards.Gains and other income increased by $18 million, primarily due to the sale of one property in the 2010 fourth quarter.The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the anticipated disposition of a golf course and related assets. Partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a $7 million write-off of capitalized software development costs in 2009 related to a project for 53Table of Contentswhich we decided not to pursue further development. Joint venture equity losses decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected higher cancellation allowances recorded at a joint venture in 2009.The $11 million decrease to zero in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interest was associated with our acquisition of that noncontrolling interest. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Appreciation Right Program”); (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that equal the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.During 2011, we granted 2.6 million RSUs, 0.7 million Employee SARs, and 29,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No. 3, “Share-Based Compensation,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards in 2011 and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.54Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOn June 23, 2011, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to extend the facility’s expiration from May 14, 2012 to June 23, 2016 and reduce (at our direction) the facility size from $2.404 billion to $1.750 billion of aggregate effective borrowings. The material terms of the amended and restated Credit Facility are otherwise unchanged, and the facility continues to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 27, 2011.The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.In early 2011 we resumed issuing commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our issuances are subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2011, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.520 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $1.418 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $102 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $1.750 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $1 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility and $331 million of outstanding commercial paper. We had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at year-end 2011. We anticipate that available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from OperationsCash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Cash from operations$1,089 $1,151 $868Depreciation expense127 138 151Amortization expense41 40 34 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2011 and 1.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2010. See Footnote No. 17, ""Spin-off"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information on the spin-off in 2011 and related decrease in current assets. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to 55Table of Contentsthis 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years2011 2010 2009 2008 20072.3x 2.9x * 3.1x 4.3x * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million.Timeshare Cash FlowsWhile our former Timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments. We show the net operating activity from our former Timeshare segment prior to the spin-off (which does not include income from our Timeshare segment) in the following table. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, new Timeshare segment mortgages totaled $214 million, $256 million, and $302 million, respectively, and collections totaled $273 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $187 million), $347 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $230 million), and $155 million, respectively.($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Timeshare segment development less than (in excess of) cost of sales$97 $15 $(4)Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages)59 91 (147)Note repurchases— — (81)Financially reportable sales less than closed sales3 58 29Note securitization gains— — (37)Note securitization proceeds— — 349Collection on retained interests in securitized notes and servicing fees— — 82Other cash inflows (outflows)12 52 (45)Net cash inflows from Timeshare segment activity$171 $216 $146For additional information on our timeshare note securitizations, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, see Footnote No. 11, “Asset Securitizations,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements. For additional information on the spin-off, please see Footnote No. 17, ""Spin-off"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements. We expect that the spin-off will result in the realization through 2015 of approximately $400 million to $450 million of cash tax benefits to Marriott, including approximately $115 million to $125 million for the 2012 fiscal year, relating to the value of the timeshare business. For 2011, we realized approximately $80 million of these cash tax benefits. Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $183 million in 2011, $307 million in 2010, and $147 million in 2009 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which we included in “Cash from Operations” prior to the spin-off, as noted in that section, were not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures in 2011 decreased primarily due to the purchase of two hotels in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2010 increased primarily due to the purchase of two hotel properties. We expect investment spending for the 2012 fiscal year will total approximately $550 million to $750 million, including $50 million to $100 million for maintenance capital spending. Investment spending will also include other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These 56Table of Contentsinvestments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segment because: (1) we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $20 million in 2011, $114 million in 2010, and $2 million in 2009.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Collections and sales for such loans, net of advances during 2011 and 2010, amounted to net loan collections of $84 million in 2011 and net loan advances of $6 million in 2010. At year-end 2011, we had no senior loans and $382 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $84 million) outstanding, compared with no senior loans and $191 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $7 million) outstanding at year-end 2010. In 2011, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $191 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. See the “Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans” caption in Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $83 million in 2011, $29 million in 2010, and $28 million in 2009 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt decreased by $658 million in 2011, to $2,171 million at year-end 2011 from $2,829 million at year-end 2010, and reflected a $1,016 million decrease in non-recourse debt associated with previously securitized notes which we transferred to MVW as part of the spin-off, partially offset by a $331 million increase in commercial paper and other debt (which includes capital leases) increases of $27 million. Debt increased by $531 million in 2010, to $2,829 million at year-end 2010 from $2,298 million at year-end 2009, and reflected consolidation of debt with a balance at year-end 2010 of $1,016 million, partially offset by decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility of $425 million and other net debt decreases of $60 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2011, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 5.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 3.6 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.82 to 1.0 at year-end 2011.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional information on our Credit Facility.During 2010, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, which had a balance outstanding at year-end 2009 of $425 million.In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million.Share Repurchases. We purchased 43.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2011 at an average price of $32.79 per share, purchased 1.5 million shares in 2010 at an average price of $39.02 per share, and did not purchase any shares in 2009. As of year-end 2011, 5.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations previously approved by our Board of Directors. On February 10, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors increased, by 35 million shares, the authorization to repurchase our Class A Common Stock. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. 57Table of ContentsDividends. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.0875 per share on February 11, 2011, and a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on May 6, August 4, and November 10, 2011, and February 10, 2012.Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2011:Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period($ in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsDebt (1)$2,484 $449 $553 $1,042 $440Capital lease obligations (1)71 3 62 2 4Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse1,059 125 222 194 518Non-recourse266 11 18 21 216Operating leases where we are secondarily liable31 12 19 — —Purchase obligations95 47 48 — —Other long-term liabilities63 — 8 1 54Total contractual obligations$4,069 $647 $930 $1,260 $1,232 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2011 of $39 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we do not anticipate that those audits will have a significant impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the next 52 weeks, it remains possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over that time period. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year-end 2011:Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal guarantees where we are the primary obligor$210 $56 $41 $49 $64Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable258 47 77 56 78Total guarantee commitments$468 $103 $118 $105 $142In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee in favor of lenders with an estimated aggregate total cost of $498 million (Canadian $508 million), and a $3 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year-end 2011. During 2010, our joint venture partners executed documents indemnifying us for any payments that may be required in connection with this guarantee.For additional information on this project completion guarantee, including our pro rata ownership percentage in the associated entity, as well as additional information on our guarantees, including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into, see the “Guarantees” caption within Footnote No. 15, “Contingencies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements.In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner.We also had the following other commitments, including loan and investment commitments, outstanding at year-end 58Table of Contents2011:Loan and Investment Commitments Amount of Loan and Investment Commitments ExpectedFunding by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal loan commitments$— $— $— $— $—Total investment commitments104 15 89 — —Total other commitments$104 $15 $89 $— $—For further information on our loan and investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments and Letters of Credit” caption within Footnote No. 15, “Contingencies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements.At year-end 2011, we also had $65 million of letters of credit outstanding ($64 million outside the Credit Facility and $1 million under our Credit Facility), the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2011 totaled $108 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our self-insurance programs.In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally vary from 10 to 49 percent. For other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 22, “Related Party Transactions,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on:Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to these programs;Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets 59Table of Contentsand when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures;Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies;Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; andLoan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and, prior to the spin-off date, for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans.OTHER MATTERSInflationInflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how such exposure is managed in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price related to our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2011, our investments had a fair value of $50 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2011, our Balance Sheet included a $2 million asset for currency exchange derivatives and a $9 million liability for an interest rate swap. Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information associated with derivative instruments.60Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2011 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$76 $48 $34 $23 $44 $57 $282 $279Average interest rate 3.45% Floating-rate notes receivable$8 $1 $1 $— $— $90 $100 $54Average interest rate 4.84% Liabilities-Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(354) $(406) $(7) $(315) $(629) $(396) $(2,107) $(1,886)Average interest rate 6.60% 61Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:21.810163

If we cannot attract and retain talented associates, our business could suffer. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop, and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses.Delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our Board of Directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts. Under the Delaware business combination statute, a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without Board of Director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, among other things, require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our Board of Directors could, without stockholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a stockholder’s rights plan.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.Item 2.Properties.We describe our company-operated properties in Part I, Item 1. “Business,” earlier in this report. We believe our properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements.

While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWLodging Business We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 74 countries and territories under numerous brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. At year-end 2012, we had 3,801 properties (660,394 rooms) in our system, including 35 home and condominium products (3,927 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. At year-end 2012, we grouped our operations into four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging.We earn base management fees and in some cases incentive management fees from the hotels that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the hotels that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like. We use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate either in conjunction with hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under our The Ritz-Carlton, EDITION, JW Marriott, Autograph Collection, and Marriott brand names. Third-party developers typically build and sell residences with little, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2012, we operated 43 percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 54 percent under franchise agreements, unconsolidated joint ventures that we have an interest in held management and provided services to franchised properties for 1 percent, and we owned or leased only 2 percent.Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (""above-property""). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in the system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. In 2012, we introduced Marriott.jp, adding Japanese language capability to our online platforms. Together with Spanish, German, French, and Chinese, our guests now have a wider selection of languages with which to discover our properties online.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. 25Table of ContentsLodging Performance MeasuresWe believe RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Lodging Results Conditions for our lodging business continued to improve in 2012, reflecting generally low supply growth, a favorable economic climate in many markets around the world, the impact of operating efficiencies across our company, and a year-over-year increase in the number of hotels. Demand was strong in most North American markets, constrained somewhat in Washington, D.C. due to weak government demand associated with government spending restrictions and a shorter congressional calendar. The D.C. market also experienced the customarily lower demand levels in 2012 associated with an election year, although leisure and group business were strong in the summer months. In Europe, many economies continue to struggle although our properties there benefited from strong international arrivals. In addition, our hotels benefited from the Olympic Games in London, the Euro Cup Soccer Championship in Warsaw, and a strong fair calendar in Germany. Demand was weak in European markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply constrained RevPAR growth in a few European markets. Demand was strong in the United Arab Emirates and improved modestly but remained weak in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, and Oman. Demand in the Asia Pacific region continued to be strong particularly for properties in Thailand, China, and Indonesia. Demand in China in 2012 moderated somewhat as the year progressed, reflecting declines in government related travel ahead of the country's change in leadership, moderating economic growth, and new supply in several markets. RevPAR in India softened throughout 2012, reflecting the country's more challenging economic environment and increased supply.Compared to 2011, 2012 worldwide average daily rates increased 3.9 percent on a constant dollar basis to $137.49 for comparable systemwide properties, RevPAR increased 6.1 percent to $97.34, and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points to 70.8 percent. We monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual hotel demand levels, generally increasing room rates as demand increases. We also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2012, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. Our company-operated properties continuously monitor costs as we focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements.The hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers. Overall, business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2012. Group demand improved in 2012, group customers spent more on their meetings, and group related property-level food and beverage volumes improved. Additionally, we saw an increase in short-term bookings for both large and small groups during 2012, and attendance at meetings frequently exceeded initial projections. Typically, two-thirds of group business is booked before the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. During an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. Group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off, and with improving group demand, is replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates. Projected group revenue for 2013 for comparable North American Marriott Hotels & Resorts properties is up six percent year-over-year, with more than half of the growth coming from rate. 26Table of ContentsNegotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented nearly 15 percent of our full-service managed hotel room nights for 2012 in North America. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our business customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend in order to maximize property-level earnings. For 2013, we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business national-accounts clients in the first quarter. With approximately 85 percent of our negotiations complete, on average room rates for comparable customers are approximately five percent higher in 2013 than the prior year. Lodging Transactions On October 1, 2012, we acquired the Gaylord brand and hotel management company from Gaylord Entertainment Company (now called Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (""Ryman Hospitality"")) for $210 million. Ryman Hospitality continues to own the Gaylord hotels, which we manage under the Gaylord brand under long-term management agreements. This transaction added four hotels and approximately 7,800 rooms to our North American Full-Service segment, and included our entering into management agreements for several attractions at the Gaylord Opryland in Nashville, consisting of a showboat, a golf course, and a saloon. As part of the transaction, on December 1, 2012, we also assumed management of another hotel owned by Ryman Hospitality, the Inn at Opryland, with approximately 300 rooms.In 2012, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay® corporate housing business. Neither the sales price nor the gain we recognized was material to our results of operations and cash flows. The revenues, results of operations, assets, and liabilities of our ExecuStay business also were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented, and accordingly we have not reflected ExecuStay as a discontinued operation.In 2012, we completed the sale of our equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) and we amended certain provisions of the management agreements for the underlying hotel portfolio. As a result of this transaction, we received cash proceeds of $96 million, including $30 million of proceeds which is refundable over the term of the management agreements if the hotel portfolio does not meet certain quarterly hotel performance thresholds. To the extent the hotel portfolio meets the quarterly hotel performance thresholds, we will recognize the $30 million of proceeds over the remaining term of the management agreements as base fee revenue. In 2012, we recognized a gain of $41 million, which consisted of: (1) $20 million for the recognition of the gain we deferred in 2005 because we retained the equity interest following the original sale of land to one of the joint ventures and because there were contingencies associated with the 2005 transaction that expired with this sale; and (2) $21 million for the gain on the sale of the equity interest. We also recognized base management fee revenue totaling $7 million in 2012, primarily that we had deferred in earlier periods, but which we earned in conjunction with the sale. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" to our Financial Statements for more information on these lodging transactions. Timeshare Spin-off and Timeshare Strategy-Impairment ChargesOn November 21, 2011 (""the spin-off date""), we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary MVW. Under license agreements with us, MVW is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under The Ritz-Carlton brand. We now earn license fees under these agreements that we include in franchise fees. We do not allocate MVW license fees to any of our segments and instead include them in ""other unallocated corporate.""Because of our significant continuing involvement in MVW operations after the spin-off (by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and MVW), we continue to include the historical financial results before the spin-off of our former Timeshare segment in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Before the spin-off, we recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after-tax) in our 2011 Income Statement under the ""Timeshare strategy-impairment charges"" caption. Please see Footnote No. 16, “Spin-off,” to our Financial Statements and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors; Other Risks” for more information on the spin-off and the impairment charges. CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAs noted in the preceding ""Business and Overview"" section, we completed the spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business in late 2011. Accordingly, we no longer have a Timeshare segment and instead now earn license fees that we do not allocate to any of our segments and include in ""other unallocated corporate."" The following tables 27Table of Contentsdetail the components of our former Timeshare segment revenues and results for 2011, as well as certain items that we did not allocate to our Timeshare segment for 2011 and also shows the components of revenue, interest income and interest expense we received from MVW for 2012.($ in millions)2012 2011 Change2012/2011Former Timeshare segment revenues Base fee revenue $— $51 Total sales and services revenue— 1,088 Cost reimbursements— 299 Former Timeshare segment revenues— 1,438 $(1,438) Other base fee revenue— 5 (5) Other unallocated corporate revenues from MVW Franchise fee revenue61 4 Cost reimbursements128 24 Revenues from MVW189 28 161 Total revenue impact$189 $1,471 $(1,282) 2012 2011 Change2012/2011Former Timeshare segment results operating income impact Base fee revenue$— $51 Timeshare sales and services, net— 159 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges— (324) General, administrative, and other expense— (63) Former Timeshare segment results operating income impact (1)— (177) $177 Other base fee revenue — 5 (5)General, administrative, and other expenses Timeshare spin-off costs — (34) 34Other miscellaneous expenses — (2) 2 Other Unallocated corporate operating income impact from MVW Franchise fee revenue61 4 57 Total operating income (loss) impact61 (204) 265Gains (losses) and other income (1)— 3 (3)Interest expense (1)(8) (43) 35Capitalized interest — 6 (6)Interest income 11 2 9Equity in earnings (losses) — 4 (4)Income (loss) before income taxes spin-off impact$64 $(232) $296(1) Timeshare segment results for year-end 2011 totaled a segment loss of $217 million and consisted of $177 million of operating losses, $43 million of interest expense, and $3 million of gains and other income. The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2012, 2011, and 2010. The results for 2011 included the results of the former Timeshare segment before the spin-off date while 2010 included the former Timeshare segment for the entire fiscal year. See ""BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare"" later in this report for more information.28Table of ContentsRevenues 2012 Compared to 2011Revenues decreased by $503 million (4 percent) to $11,814 million in 2012 from $12,317 million in 2011. As detailed in the preceding table, the spin-off contributed to a net $1,282 million decrease in revenues that was partially offset by a $779 million increase in revenues in our lodging business.The $779 million increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($757 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million, comprised of an $18 million increase for North America and a $19 million increase outside of North America), and higher base management fees ($35 million), partially offset by lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($94 million, which includes a $70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section). The $562 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $9,405 million in 2012 from $8,843 million in 2011, reflected a $757 million increase (allocated across our lodging business) resulting from higher property-level demand and growth across our system, partially offset by a net $195 million decline in timeshare-related cost reimbursements due to the spin-off. The $21 million decrease in total base management fees, to $581 million in 2012 from $602 million in 2011, primarily reflected a decline of $56 million in former Timeshare segment ($51 million) and International segment ($5 million) base management fees due to the spin-off, partially offset by a net increase of $35 million across our lodging business. The $35 million net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($24 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($9 million), as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of $7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a North American-Limited Service joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and the unfavorable impact of $3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions. The $101 million increase in total franchise fees, to $607 million in 2012 from $506 million in 2011, primarily reflected an increase of $57 million in license fees from MVW and an increase of $44 million across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger RevPAR ($27 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($13 million). The $37 million increase in incentive management fees from $195 million in 2011 to $232 million in 2012 primarily reflected higher net property-level income ($30 million), new unit growth, net of terminations ($6 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million). In 2012, 33 percent of our managed properties paid us incentive management fees versus 29 percent in 2011. In addition, in 2012, 65 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 67 percent in 2011. In North America, 14 North American Full-Service segment properties, seven North American Limited-Service segment properties, and two Luxury segment properties earned a combined $13 million in incentive management fees in 2012, but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2011. The $94 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $989 million in 2012 from $1,083 million in 2011, primarily reflected $70 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter, $29 million of lower owned and leased revenue, and $3 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $7 million of higher branding fees and $3 million of higher other revenue. The $29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected: (1) $34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our International segment, primarily driven by three hotels that left the system ($18 million), weaker demand at three other hotels ($6 million), two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties ($5 million), and unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million); and (2) $23 million of lower revenue at a North American Full-Service segment property that converted from leased to managed at year-end 2011; partially offset by (3) $14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in London due to strong demand, in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games; and (4) $10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in Japan. The property in Japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $106 million in 2012 and $99 million in 2011.29Table of Contents2011 Compared to 2010Revenues increased by $626 million (5 percent) to $12,317 million in 2011 from $11,691 million in 2010, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($604 million); base management and franchise fees ($105 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($37 million); and incentive management fees ($13 million, all from properties outside of North America). These favorable variances were partially offset by lower Timeshare sales and services revenue ($133 million).The increases in base management fees, to $602 million in 2011 from $562 million in 2010, and in franchise fees, to $506 million in 2011 from $441 million in 2010, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, the impact of unit growth across our system and favorable foreign exchange rates. Base management fees in 2011 included $51 million for the timeshare business compared to $55 million in the prior year. Franchise fees in 2011 included $4 million for MVW license fees. The increase in incentive management fees from $182 million in 2010 to $195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and continued property-level cost controls and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates.The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,083 million in 2011, from $1,046 million in 2010, reflected $21 million of higher total branding fees, $7 million of higher corporate housing revenue, $4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $99 million in 2011 and $78 million in 2010.The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, to $1,088 million in 2011 from $1,221 million in 2010, primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue reflecting the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily for sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income resulting from the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance before the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue, primarily reflecting the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue reflecting the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates before the spin-off date. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for more information on our former Timeshare segment.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,843 million in 2011 from $8,239 million in 2010, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system.Operating Income2012 Compared to 2011Operating income increased by $414 million to $940 million in 2012 from $526 million in 2011. The $414 million increase in operating income reflected a net $265 million favorable variance due to the spin-off (which included $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2011), as detailed in the preceding table, and a $149 million increase across our lodging business. This $149 million increase across our lodging business reflected a $44 million increase in franchise fees, a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, $25 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and an $8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees across our lodging business compared to 2011 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $25 million (18 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $19 million of net stronger results, particularly at one leased property in Japan ($9 million) and one leased property in London ($8 million), $7 million of higher branding fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue, partially offset by $3 million of lower termination fees. Our leased property in London benefited from strong demand and higher property-level margins in 2012 in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games, while our leased property in Japan experienced strong demand in 2012, benefiting from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $107 million (14 percent) to $645 million in 2012 from $752 million in 2011. The $107 million decrease reflected a decline of $99 million due to the spin-off (consisting of $63 million of former Timeshare segment general, administrative, and other expenses and $36 million of other expenses not previously allocated to the former Timeshare segment, including $34 million of Timeshare spin-off costs and $2 million of other 30Table of Contentsexpenses), and a decline of $8 million across our lodging business. The $8 million decrease across our lodging business was primarily a result of: (1) favorable variances from the following 2011 items: (a) a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both for one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; (b) a $5 million performance cure payment for a North American Full-Service property; and (c) $8 million for a guarantee accrual for one North American Full-Service property and the write-off of contract acquisition costs for several other properties; and (2) $11 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012, primarily associated with four properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released; (3) a favorable litigation settlement, partially offset by higher legal expenses, netting to a favorable $3 million; and (4) $2 million in decreased expenses due to favorable foreign exchange rates. These favorable items were partially offset by: (1) the following unfavorable 2012 items: (a) $20 million of increased compensation and other overhead expenses; and (b) the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisitions costs for a North American Full-Service segment property (for which we earned a termination fee that we recorded in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue); and (2) the unfavorable variance for a $5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows. See ""BUSINESS SEGMENTS: North American Full-Service Lodging"" for more information on the termination fee and the related accelerated amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs recorded in 2012. The $8 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses across our lodging business consisted of a $21 million decrease allocated to our Luxury segment, partially offset by an $11 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments and a $2 million increase allocated to our North American Full-Service segment. 2011 Compared to 2010Operating income decreased by $169 million to $526 million in 2011 from $695 million in 2010. The decrease reflected $324 million of 2011 Timeshare strategy-impairment charges and $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $105 million increase in base management and franchise fees, $49 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $28 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, and $13 million of higher incentive management fees. We address the reasons for the increases in base management and franchise fees and in incentive management fees in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $49 million (54 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $21 million of higher branding fees, $15 million of net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property-level margins, $6 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, net of 2010 termination costs, $6 million of higher corporate housing and other revenue, net of expenses, and $5 million of decreased rent expense, partially offset by $4 million of lower results at a leased hotel in Japan that experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $28 million (4 percent) to $752 million in 2011 from $780 million in 2010. The decrease primarily reflected favorable variances from the following 2010 items: an $84 million long-lived asset impairment charge for a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a $13 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our former Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment). Also contributing to the decrease in expenses, was $9 million of lower former Timeshare segment expenses due to the spin-off and a $5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows. These favorable variances were partially offset by the following 2011 items: $34 million of transaction-related expenses for the spin-off of the timeshare business; $17 million of higher compensation costs; $10 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets and initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, a $5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both for one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; a $5 million performance cure payment for a North American Full-Service property; and $7 million for an increase in the guarantee reserves for one International and one North American Full-Service property, primarily due to cash flow shortfalls at those properties, and a $2 million write-off of contract acquisition costs for two other properties. The favorable variances were further offset by the following 2010 items: a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States and a $6 million reversal of guarantee accruals, primarily for a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements. The $28 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses consisted of a $34 million decrease that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $22 million decrease allocated to our former Timeshare segment; and a $12 million decrease allocated to our North American Limited-Service segment; partially offset by a $20 million increase allocated to our Luxury segment; a $15 million increase allocated to our International segment; and a $5 million increase allocated to our North American Full-Service segment.31Table of ContentsTimeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses totaled $159 million in 2011 and $199 million in 2010. The decrease of $40 million as compared to 2010, primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in 2010 and, to a lesser extent in 2011 the impact of the spin-off as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin-off as well as lower notes receivable balances before the spin-off date. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin-off. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for more information on our former Timeshare segment before spin-off.Gains (Losses) and Other IncomeWe show our gains (losses) and other income for 2012, 2011, and 2010 in the following table: ($ in millions)2012 2011 2010Net gain on sale of real estate and other$27 $11 $34Net gain on sale of joint venture and other investments21 — 1Income from cost method joint ventures2 — —Impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities(8) (18) — $42 $(7) $352012 Compared to 2011In 2012, we recognized a total gain of $41 million on the sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) which consisted of: (1) a $21 million gain on the sale of this interest reflected in the ""Net gain on sale of joint venture and other investments"" caption in the preceding table; and (2) recognition of the $20 million remaining gain we deferred in 2005 due to contingencies in the original transaction documents for the sale of land to one of the joint ventures, reflected in the ""Net gain on sale of real estate and other"" caption in the preceding table. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" to the Financial Statements for more information on the sale of this equity interest.The ""Impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities"" line in the preceding table reflects the other-than-temporary impairment in 2012 of two cost method joint venture investments and the other-than-temporary impairment in 2011 of marketable equity securities. For more information on the $7 million impairment of one of the cost method joint venture investments in 2012 and the impairment of marketable equity securities in 2011, see Footnote No. 4, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” to the Financial Statements.2011 Compared to 2010The $23 million decrease in net gain on sale of real estate and other primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from an $18 million gain on the sale of one Timeshare segment property in 2010. The $18 million impairment in 2011 shown in the ""Impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities"" caption in the preceding table reflects an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities, as discussed previously under the ""2012 Compared to 2011"" caption.Interest Expense2012 Compared to 2011Interest expense decreased by $27 million (16 percent) to $137 million in 2012 compared to $164 million in 2011. This decrease reflected a $29 million decrease due to the spin-off, partially offset by a $2 million increase for our lodging business. The $29 million decrease in interest expense due to the spin-off consisted of interest expense in 2011 that was allocated to the former Timeshare segment ($43 million), partially offset by interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for costs that were a component of ""Timeshare-direct"" expenses before the spin-off ($8 million) and the unfavorable variance to 2011 for capitalized interest expense for construction projects for our former Timeshare segment ($6 million). For the $8 million of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing spin-off obligations, we also recorded $8 million of ""Interest income"" in 2012 for the 32Table of Contentsassociated notes receivable. The $2 million increase in interest expense for our lodging business was primarily for the Series K Notes and the Series L Notes we issued in 2012 ($23 million) as well as increased interest expense for our Marriott Rewards program and our commercial paper program, reflecting higher average balances and interest rates ($2 million), partially offset by increased capitalized interest expense principally for lodging construction projects ($15 million) and the absence of interest expense for the Series F Senior Notes following our repayment of those notes in 2012 ($9 million). See the “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” caption later in this report for more information on our credit facility.2011 Compared to 2010Interest expense decreased by $16 million (9 percent) to $164 million in 2011 compared to $180 million in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by: (1) a $12 million decrease in interest expense on securitized notes, reflecting the transfer of these notes to MVW on the spin-off date, as well as a lower average outstanding balance and a lower average interest rate on those notes before the spin-off date; (2) a $2 million increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects; and (3) a $1 million decrease in interest expense for our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, reflecting lower interest rates.Interest Income and Income Tax2012 Compared to 2011Interest income increased by $3 million (21 percent) to $17 million in 2012 compared to $14 million in 2011, primarily reflecting $9 million of increased interest income for two notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spin-off, partially offset by a $6 million decrease primarily from the repayment of certain loans. For $8 million of the $9 million increase in interest income in 2012 for notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spin-off, we also recorded $8 million of ""Interest expense"" in 2012 for ongoing obligations for those notes. Our tax provision increased by $120 million (76 percent) to $278 million in 2012 from $158 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the absence of timeshare pre-tax losses in 2012 due to the spin-off and the effect of higher pre-tax income from our lodging business, as well as a lower percentage of lodging pre-tax income in 2012 from jurisdictions outside the U.S. with lower tax rates. These increases in the provision were partially offset by a favorable variance from $34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets transferred to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off, as discussed under the following ""2011 Compared to 2010"" caption. 2011 Compared to 2010Interest income decreased by $5 million (26 percent) to $14 million in 2011 compared to $19 million in 2010, primarily reflecting a $3 million decrease from the repayment of certain loans. Our tax provision increased by $65 million (70 percent) to $158 million in 2011 from $93 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable variance related to a prior year IRS settlement on the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that resulted in an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 and $34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets that we transferred to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off. We impaired these assets because we considered it ""more likely than not"" that MVW will be unable to realize the value of those deferred tax assets. Please see Footnote No. 16, ""Spin-off"" to our Financial Statements for more information on the transaction. The increases were partially offset by lower pre-tax income in 2011.Equity in Losses2012 Compared to 2011Equity in losses of $13 million in 2012 was unchanged from equity in losses of $13 million in 2011, and reflected a $4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business, entirely offset by a $4 million unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spin-off. The $4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business primarily reflected $3 million of increased earnings at two International segment joint ventures, $3 million of decreased losses at two other joint ventures, and a $3 million favorable variance from the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) which had losses in the prior year, partially offset by $3 million of increased losses at a Luxury segment joint venture, and a $2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another Luxury segment joint venture. The $3 million of increased losses at a Luxury segment joint venture reflected increased losses of $8 million primarily from the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012, partially offset by $5 million of decreased losses in 2012, after the impairment, as a result of decreased joint venture costs. The $4 33Table of Contentsmillion unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spin-off reflected the $4 million reversal in 2011 of the funding liability associated with Timeshare-strategy impairment charges we originally recorded in 2009. See Footnote No. 18, ""Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges"" of our 2011 Form 10-K for additional information on this reversal. 2011 Compared to 2010Equity in losses of $13 million in 2011 decreased by $5 million from equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased earnings at two North American Limited-Service joint ventures and one International segment joint venture, primarily due to stronger property-level performance; $8 million of lower losses for a residential and fractional project joint venture (our former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their share of the joint venture’s losses as their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010); and a favorable variance from 2010 joint venture impairment charges of $5 million for our North American Limited-Service segment. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $8 million of decreased earnings at two Luxury segment joint ventures. We also reversed $4 million in 2011 and $11 million in 2010 of the $27 million funding liability we initially recorded in the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating) caption of our 2009 Income Statement (see Footnote No. 18, ""Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges"" of the Notes to our Financial Statements of the 2011 Form 10-K for more information). We recorded both the $11 million reversal in 2010 and the $4 million reversal in 2011 based on facts and circumstances surrounding a project related to our former Timeshare segment, including continued progress on certain construction-related legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of the partners. Net Income2012 Compared to 2011Net income increased by $373 million to $571 million in 2012 from $198 million in 2011, and diluted earnings per share increased by $1.17 per share (213 percent) to $1.72 per share from $0.55 per share in 2011. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” the $373 million increase in net income was due to the impact of the spin-off ($296 million), as well as the following increases across our lodging business: higher gains and other income ($52 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million), higher base management fees ($35 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($25 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($8 million), and lower equity in losses ($4 million). These increases were partially offset by higher income taxes ($120 million) as well as the following decreases across our lodging business: lower interest income ($6 million) and higher interest expense ($2 million).2011 Compared to 2010Net income decreased by $260 million (57 percent) to $198 million in 2011 from $458 million in 2010, and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.66 per share (55 percent) to $0.55 per share from $1.21 per share in 2010. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” the $260 million decrease in net income was due to Timeshare strategy-impairment charges ($324 million), higher income taxes ($65 million), lower gains and other income ($42 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($40 million), and lower interest income ($5 million). Higher base management and franchise fees ($105 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($49 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($28 million), lower interest expense ($16 million), higher incentive management fees ($13 million), and lower equity in losses ($5 million) partially offset these items.Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA, a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These 34Table of Contentsdifferences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects: •Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments for 2011 (""Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments"") as if the spin-off occurred on the first day of 2011. The Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments of $260 million reflected in net income for 2011 totaled $300 million pre-tax and are primarily comprised of the following pre-tax items: (1) the addition of $217 million to remove the losses of our former Timeshare segment; (2) the addition of a $60 million payment by MVW to us of estimated license fees; (3) the addition of $34 million to remove unallocated spin-off transaction costs; (4) the addition of $10 million of estimated interest income; (5) the subtraction of $14 million of estimated interest expense; and (6) the subtraction of $7 million of other expenses not previously allocated to our former Timeshare segment; and• Adjustments for Other Charges for 2011. These adjustments of $17 million to net income for 2011 totaled $28 million pre-tax and consist of the following pre-tax items: (1) an $18 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities; and (2) a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both for one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy. We discuss the other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities in greater detail in the preceding ""Gains (Losses) and Other Income"" caption.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA that excludes these items is also a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and in particular Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting EBITDA's and Adjusted EBITDA's usefulness as comparative measures. We provide Adjusted EBITDA for illustrative and informational purposes only and Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily indicative of, and we do not purport that it represents, what our operating results would have been had the spin-off occurred on the first day of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the 2011 timeshare spin-off.35Table of ContentsWe show our 2012 and 2011 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations and reconcile those measures with Net Income in the following tables: ($ in millions)As Reported 2012 Net Income$571 Interest expense137 Tax provision278 Depreciation and amortization145 Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third-party owners(16) Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures11 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures20 EBITDA$1,146 ($ in millions)As Reported 2011 Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments Other Charges 2011 Adjusted EBITDANet Income$198 $260 $17 Interest expense164 (29) — Tax provision158 40 11 Depreciation and amortization168 (28) — Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third-party owners(15) — — Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures18 — — Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures30 — — EBITDA$721 $243 $28 $992 36Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsWe are a diversified lodging company with operations in four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. See Footnote No. 15, “Business Segments,” to our Financial Statements for further information on our segments, including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment and other information about each segment, including revenues, net income (loss), equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees, assets, and capital expenditures. In addition to our four current segments, on November 21, 2011 we spun off our former timeshare operations and timeshare development business, which had until that time been our Timeshare segment, as a new independent company, MVW. See Footnote No. 15, “Business Segments,” to our Financial Statements for historical financial results of our former Timeshare segment and Footnote No. 16, ""Spin-off"" to our Financial Statements for more information on the spin-off. Also, see the ""CONSOLIDATED RESULTS"" caption earlier in this report for more information, including tables, on the impact of the spin-off.37Table of ContentsAt year-end 2012, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties by segment: Total Lodging and Timeshare Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. TotalNorth American Full-Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts320 14 334 126,113 5,244 131,357Marriott Conference Centers10 — 10 2,915 — 2,915JW Marriott22 1 23 12,649 221 12,870Renaissance Hotels77 2 79 28,248 790 29,038Renaissance ClubSport2 — 2 349 — 349Gaylord Hotels5 — 5 8,098 — 8,098Autograph Collection24 — 24 6,609 — 6,609 460 17 477 184,981 6,255 191,236North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard817 21 838 114,948 3,734 118,682Fairfield Inn & Suites678 11 689 61,477 1,234 62,711SpringHill Suites297 2 299 34,844 299 35,143Residence Inn602 19 621 72,642 2,808 75,450TownePlace Suites208 2 210 20,803 278 21,081 2,602 55 2,657 304,714 8,353 313,067International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts— 155 155 — 44,852 44,852JW Marriott— 36 36 — 12,923 12,923Renaissance Hotels— 74 74 — 23,902 23,902Autograph Collection— 8 8 — 1,056 1,056Courtyard— 91 91 — 17,871 17,871Fairfield Inn & Suites— 2 2 — 334 334Residence Inn— 4 4 — 421 421Marriott Executive Apartments— 25 25 — 4,066 4,066 — 395 395 — 105,425 105,425Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz-Carlton38 42 80 11,357 12,410 23,767Bulgari Hotels & Resorts— 3 3 — 202 202EDITION— 1 1 — 78 78The Ritz-Carlton-Residential(2)30 5 35 3,598 329 3,927The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments— 4 4 — 579 579 68 55 123 14,955 13,598 28,553Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Autograph Collection— 5 5 — 348 348AC Hotels by Marriott— 79 79 — 8,736 8,736 — 84 84 — 9,084 9,084 Timeshare (3)50 15 65 10,706 2,323 13,029 Total3,180 621 3,801 515,356 145,038 660,394 (1) North American includes properties located in the United States and Canada.

These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. During 2012, we also added three residential properties (89 units). No residential properties or units exited the system. Total segment financial results increased by $408 million to $1,173 million in 2012 from $765 million in 2011, and total segment revenues decreased by $671 million to $11,526 million in 2012, a 6 percent decrease from revenues of $12,197 million in 2011. The $408 million increase in segment results reflected a $212 million favorable variance from the spin-off (which included $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2011) and a net $196 million increase in segment results across our lodging business. The $671 million decrease in total segment revenues reflected a $1,443 million decrease due to the impact of the spin-off that was partially offset by a net $772 million increase across our lodging business.The year-over-year net increase in segment revenues across our lodging business of $772 million resulted from a $757 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $44 million increase in franchise fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, and a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $101 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue. The $196 million year-over-year increase in segment results across our lodging business reflected a $44 million increase in franchise fees, $39 million of higher gains and other income, a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, a $19 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, an $18 million increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses. For more detailed information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2011, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2012 increased by 120 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 9.0 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and lower energy costs. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 140 basis points compared to 2011. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 9.9 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 90 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 7.3 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity.2011 Compared to 2010We added 206 properties (30,856 rooms) and 30 properties (6,262 rooms) exited our system in 2011. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. During that time, we also added four residential properties (753 units) and no residential properties exited the system. These property additions include 80 hotels (8,371 rooms) which are operated or franchised as part of our unconsolidated joint venture with AC Hoteles, S.A. See Footnote No. 7, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for more information about AC Hotels by Marriott.Total segment financial results decreased by $218 million (22 percent) to $765 million in 2011 from $983 million in 2010, and total segment revenues increased by $586 million to $12,197 million in 2011, a 5 percent increase from revenues of $11,611 million in 2010.The year-over-year increase in revenues included a $604 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. Total segment financial results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, a $40 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $24 million decrease in gains and other income, and a $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were: a $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,104 million in 2011 from $1,003 million in 2010, a $37 million increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of higher incentive management fees to $195 million in 2011 from $182 million in 2010, $13 million of lower joint venture equity losses, and a $12 million decrease in interest expense. For more detailed information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income.”39Table of ContentsThe $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. In 2011, 29 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 27 percent in 2010. In addition, in 2011, 67 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 65 percent in 2010.See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2010, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2011 increased by 60 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated HP-PAR increased by 7.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, and the impact of tight cost controls in 2011 at properties in our system, partially offset by higher property-level compensation. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 70 basis points compared to 2010 and HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 8.1 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 6.7 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and continued tight property-level cost controls, partially offset by higher property-level compensation and the effects of RevPAR declines in the Middle East.Lodging Development We added 122 properties, totaling 27,059 rooms, across our brands in 2012 and 42 properties (8,883 rooms) left the system, not including residential products or ExecuStay. We also added three residential properties (89 units) and no residential properties left the system. Highlights of the year included:•Converting 30 properties (5,553 rooms), or 20 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands, including seven properties joining our Autograph Collection brand. Twenty-one of the properties converted were located in the United States;•Thirty percent of our gross room additions were from the acquisition of the Gaylord brand and hotel management company. At year-end 2012, as a result of the acquisition, we managed five hotels (8,098 rooms) as well as other attractions including a showboat, golf course, and saloon;•Adding approximately 30 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; and•Adding 70 properties (8,470 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands.We currently have nearly 130,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30,000 to 35,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2013.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.40Table of ContentsStatistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. We report financial results for all properties on a period-end basis, but report statistics for properties located outside the United States and Canada on a month-end basis.Reporting periods and currency. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics we use throughout this report are for the following 52 week periods: for 2012, December 31, 2011 through December 28, 2012; for 2011, January 1, 2011 through December 30, 2011; and for 2010, January 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010; except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton and Autograph Collection brand properties and properties located outside of the United States where statistics are for the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparison to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. 41Table of Contents Comparable Company-OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2012 Change vs.2011 2012 Change vs.2011 Marriott Hotels & Resorts Occupancy72.7% 1.8 %pts. 70.1% 1.8%pts.

Eight properties (3,569 rooms) left the system.In 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 6.4 percent to $109.93, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.8 percent to $156.30.The $56 million increase in segment results, compared to 2011, primarily reflected $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $15 million of higher incentive management fees, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $2 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, unit growth. The $15 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and margins. The $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $14 million termination fee for one property in 2012 and $3 million of net stronger owned and leased property results, primarily driven by two properties that left the system and had losses in the prior year, partially offset by $7 million of termination fees for two properties in 2011. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $2 million and primarily reflected the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for the property for which we earned the $14 million termination fee and $2 million of miscellaneous cost increases, partially offset by favorable variances from the following 2011 items: a $5 million performance cure payment we made for one property, a $2 million guarantee accrual for one property, and the write-off of contract acquisition costs totaling $2 million for two properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $5,325 million in 2012, compared to $4,862 million in 2011.2011 Compared to 2010In 2011, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment we added ten properties (4,178 rooms) and seven properties (1,925 rooms) left the system.In 2011, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 5.2 percent to $102.10, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.3 percentage points to 68.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.3 percent to $149.36.The $34 million increase in segment results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $26 million of higher management and franchise fees and $16 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.Higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and unit growth, including properties added to the Autograph Collection.The $16 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to $7 million of net stronger results driven by higher RevPAR and property-level margins, $7 million of termination fees for two properties, and a $3 million favorable variance from prior year losses for a leased property that we now operate under a management agreement.48Table of ContentsThe $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected the following 2011 items: a $5 million performance cure payment for one property, a $2 million increase in the guarantee reserve for one property, and a $2 million write-off of contract acquisition costs for two properties. The increase was partially offset by a favorable variance from a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge that we recorded in 2010 because we expected that a management agreement for one property would be terminated early in 2011 as a result of a change in property ownership.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,862 million in 2011, compared to $4,587 million in 2010.North American Limited-Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and before we sold this business in April 2012 included Marriott ExecuStay.

The majority of the properties that left the system were older Fairfield Inn properties. In addition, in April 2012, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay corporate housing business, which we historically had not included in our rooms count. The revenues, results of operations, assets, and liabilities of our ExecuStay business were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented. In 2012, we also completed the sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service Lodging segment joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale), which did not result in any rooms leaving the system. In 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 6.3 percent to $79.07, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.3 percentage points to 71.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.4 percent to $111.12.The $90 million increase in segment results, compared to 2011, primarily reflected $43 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $41 million of higher gains and other income, $4 million of decreased joint venture equity losses, and $2 million of higher incentive management fees. Higher gains and other income reflected a $41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture. See the ""Gains (Losses) and Other Income"" caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest. Higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR due to increased demand, some of which is attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations, and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth and our recognition of $7 million of deferred base management fees in 2012 in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture. The $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture which had losses in the prior year. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,842 million in 2012, compared to $1,687 million in 2011.2011 Compared to 2010In 2011, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment we added 68 properties (8,379 rooms) and 13 properties (1,432 rooms) left the system. The majority of the properties that left the system were older Residence Inn and Fairfield Inn properties.In 2011, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 7.0 percent to $74.29, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.6 percentage points to 70.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.0 percent to $106.02.49Table of ContentsThe $84 million increase in segment results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $50 million of higher franchise and base management fees, $12 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $12 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $11 million of decreased joint venture equity losses.Higher franchise and base management fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR and new unit growth, as well as the favorable effect of property renovations.The $12 million increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of stronger results for owned and leased properties driven by higher RevPAR and property-level margins, $3 million of higher corporate housing revenue, net of expenses, and $2 million of higher termination fees.The $12 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $14 million long-lived asset impairment charge in 2010, partially offset by $2 million of other cost increases. The $11 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected $5 million of increased earnings in 2011 for two joint ventures principally reflecting stronger property-level performance and a $5 million impairment charge recorded in 2010 for another joint venture.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,687 million in 2011, compared to $1,548 million in 2010.International Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Autograph Collection, Courtyard, AC Hotels by Marriott, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the United States and Canada.

Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in Thailand, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico, while Europe experienced more modest RevPAR increases. Demand remained particularly weak in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and markets in Europe more dependent on regional travel.The $17 million increase in segment results in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflected a $16 million increase in incentive management fees and $2 million of decreased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by a $1 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. Aggregate base management and franchise fees as well as general, administrative, and other expenses remained unchanged compared to 2011.The $16 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income associated with better RevPAR and margins ($10 million), new unit growth net of terminations ($3 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with a property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million). Aggregate base management and franchise fees were unchanged and reflected $5 million of lower base management fees due to the spin-off, offset by $5 million of higher base management and franchise fees across our lodging business. The decrease in base management fees due to the spin-off reflected fees that the International segment no longer receives from the timeshare business following the spin-off. The $5 million increase in base management and franchise fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($8 million), new unit growth net of terminations ($5 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and contract revisions for certain properties ($3 million).The $2 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased earnings at two joint ventures. 50Table of ContentsThe $1 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $8 million of lower termination fees in 2012, partially offset by net stronger results principally at a leased property in London in 2012 which had increased demand. General, administrative, and other expenses remained unchanged and primarily reflected $6 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, almost entirely offset by $3 million of lower accounts receivable reserves, and a $2 million guarantee accrual reversal in 2012 for one property where we were released of the guarantee. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International Lodging segment properties totaled $682 million in 2012, compared to $621 million in 2011.2011 Compared to 2010In 2011, across our International Lodging segment we added 121 properties (16,355 rooms) and eight properties (2,428 rooms) left the system, largely due to quality issues. The properties added include 80 AC Hotels by Marriott properties (8,371 rooms) that are operated or franchised as part of our new unconsolidated joint ventures.In 2011, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 6.4 percent to $114.03, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.1 percentage points to 70.8 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.7 percent to $161.01. Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in South America, India, China, Thailand, and France, while Egypt experienced RevPAR declines.The $10 million increase in segment results in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily reflected an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million increase in incentive management fees, $3 million of lower joint venture equity losses and $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $15 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of lower gains and other income.The $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected new unit growth, strong RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange rates. The $8 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth, favorable foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue at several properties, partially offset by lower property-level revenue at properties in the Middle East. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected $7 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally and a $5 million increase in a guarantee reserve for one property with projected cash flow shortfalls.The $5 million decrease in gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a net gain associated with the sale of two properties and one joint venture in 2010.The $3 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected decreased losses at one joint venture.The $1 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of decreased rent expense and $2 million of stronger results at one property, partially offset by $5 million of lower income related to the conversion of two properties from owned to managed.

The $21 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both recognized in 2011 and both for one property whose owner filed for bankruptcy, as well as $8 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012 for three properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released.The $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $9 million increase associated with our leased property in Japan (which experienced very low demand in 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami and received a $2 million business interruption payment in 2012 from a utility company). The $4 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth. The $3 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased losses of $8 million, principally for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012, partially offset by $5 million of decreased losses after the impairment, as a result of decreased joint venture costs. The $3 million decrease in gains and other income primarily reflected the impairment of a cost method joint venture investment.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,428 million in 2012, compared to $1,350 million in 2011.2011 Compared to 2010In 2011, across our Luxury Lodging segment we added seven properties (1,862 rooms) and two properties (477 rooms) left the system.

Timeshare contract sales decreased in 2011 primarily as a result of the spin-off of the timeshare business resulting in fewer periods of Timeshare segment activity reflected in the 2011 fiscal year, as compared to a full fiscal year in 2010, as well as difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions in 2010 and the start-up impact of the shift from the sale of weeks-based to points-based products in the 2010 third quarter. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $19 million decrease in cancellation allowances that we recorded in 2010 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue, previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to contract cancellations before closing.The $113 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,438 million from $1,551 million primarily reflected a $133 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $4 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $24 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance before the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue which primarily reflected the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates.Segment results decreased by $343 million to segment losses of $217 million in 2011 from segment income of $126 million in 2010, and primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges, $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $17 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of lower base management fees, partially offset by $22 million of lower general, administrative, and other expense, $12 million of lower interest expense, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses.The $40 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in the prior year and, to a lesser extent the impact of the spin-off in 2011 as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin-off as well as lower notes receivable balances. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin-off. Gains and other income decreased by $17 million and primarily reflected the sale of one property for a gain in 2010 and smaller gains on sales of property in 2011. Base management fees decreased by $4 million, primarily due to the spin-off. General, administrative, and other expense decreased by $22 million primarily due to a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the disposition of a golf course and related assets as well as the impact of the spin-off. For more information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010, see Footnote No. 6, “Property and Equipment,” to our Financial Statements.Joint venture equity losses decreased by $8 million and primarily reflected lower losses from a residential and fractional project joint venture for which the former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their portion of the losses since their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010.The $12 million decrease in interest expense was a result of the transfer of the outstanding debt obligations associated with securitized notes receivable to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off, as well as lower outstanding debt obligations and lower interest rates.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock (“Stock Appreciation Right Program”); (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that equal the market price of our common stock on the date of grant.During 2012, we granted 3.2 million RSUs, 1.0 million Employee SARs, 0.3 million stock options, and 27,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No. 3, “Share-Based Compensation,” to our Financial Statements for more information.54Table of ContentsNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Financial Statements for information on our adoption of new accounting standards in 2012 and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.55Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOur Credit Facility provides for $1.750 billion of aggregate effective borrowings. The facility supports general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. The term of the facility expires on June 23, 2016. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2012, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.321 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $1.233 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $88 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $1.750 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $501 million of outstanding commercial paper, $15 million of outstanding Credit Facility borrowings, and $1 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs through commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from OperationsCash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2012 2011 2010Cash from operations$989 $1,089 $1,151Depreciation expense93 127 138Amortization expense52 41 40 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2012 and 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2011. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.56Table of ContentsOur ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years2012 2011 2010 2009 20084.6x 2.3x 2.9x * 3.1x * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million.Timeshare Cash FlowsWhile our former Timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments. We show the net operating activity from our former Timeshare segment before the spin-off (which did not include income from our former Timeshare segment) in the following table. New Timeshare segment mortgages totaled $214 million in 2011 and $256 million in 2010, and collections totaled $273 million in 2011 (which included collections on securitized notes of $187 million) and $347 million in 2010 (which included collections on securitized notes of $230 million).($ in millions)2011 2010Timeshare segment development less than cost of sales$97 $15Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages)59 91Financially reportable sales less than closed sales3 58Other cash inflows12 52Net cash inflows from former Timeshare segment activity$171 $216For more information on our timeshare note securitizations, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, see Footnote No. 10, “Asset Securitizations,” to our Financial Statements. We expect that our 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business will result in our realization through 2014 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. We realized $152 million of cash tax benefits in 2012 and $76 million in 2011.We expect to realize approximately $140 million in 2013. For more information on the spin-off, please see Footnote No. 16, ""Spin-off,"" to our Financial Statements.Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $437 million in 2012, $183 million in 2011, and $307 million in 2010. These included expenditures for the development and construction of new hotels, acquisitions of hotel properties, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. These numbers do not reflect former Timeshare segment development expenditures, which we included in “Cash from Operations” before the spin-off, as noted in that section. Capital expenditures in 2012 increased by $254 million compared to 2011. Capital expenditures primarily reflected acquisition of land and a building, as well as renovations of buildings associated with plans to develop three EDITION hotels. Over time, we anticipate selling these properties subject to our retaining long-term management agreements. We also purchased land for an EDITION hotel, which we anticipate will be developed by a third party. Contract acquisition costs in 2012 increased by $179 million compared to 2011, primarily due to the $192 million acquisition of the Gaylord hotel management company. Separately, we classified the $18 million acquisition of the Gaylord brand name in 2012 as ""Other investing activities."" Capital expenditures in 2011 decreased by $124 million compared to 2010, primarily due to the purchase of two hotels in 2010. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions,"" to our Financial Statements for more information on these acquisitions. We expect 2013 investment spending will total approximately $600 million to $800 million, including approximately $100 million for maintenance capital spending. Investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments.57Table of ContentsOver time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $65 million in 2012, $20 million in 2011, and $114 million in 2010. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions,"" to our Financial Statements for more information on dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections and sales, net of loan advances, amounted to $138 million in 2012 and $84 million in 2011. At year-end 2012, we had a $15 million long-term senior loan and $227 million of mezzanine and other loans ($165 million long-term and $62 million short-term) outstanding, compared with no senior loans and $382 million of mezzanine and other loans ($298 million long-term and $84 million short-term) outstanding at year-end 2011. In 2012, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $140 million, primarily reflecting collection of a $69 million note receivable for a recoverable guarantee that we previously funded and $77 million of collections on two MVW notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spin-off. See the “Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans” caption in Footnote No. 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.""Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $15 million in 2012, $83 million in 2011, and $29 million in 2010 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt increased by $764 million in 2012, to $2,935 million at year-end 2012 from $2,171 million at year-end 2011, and reflected our 2012 issuance of $594 million (book value) of Series K Senior Notes, our 2012 issuance of $349 million (book value) of Series L Senior Notes, a $170 million increase in commercial paper, and $15 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, partially offset by the $348 million (book value) retirement, at maturity, of our Series F Senior Notes and decreases of $16 million in other debt (which includes capital leases). See Footnote No. 11, ""Long-Term Debt"" for additional information on the debt issuances. Debt decreased by $658 million in 2011, to $2,171 million at year-end 2011 from $2,829 million at year-end 2010, and reflected a $1,016 million decrease in nonrecourse debt for previously securitized notes which we transferred to MVW as part of the spin-off, partially offset by a $331 million increase in commercial paper and increases of $27 million in other debt (which includes capital leases). On February 15, 2013 (after year-end 2012), we made a $411 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series J Notes.Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2012, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 3.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.7 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2012.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases. We purchased 31.2 million shares of our common stock in 2012 at an average price of $37.15 per share, purchased 43.4 million shares in 2011 at an average price of $32.79 per share, and purchased 1.5 million shares in 2010 at an average price of $39.02 per share. As of year-end 2012, 9.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. On February 15, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors increased, by 25 million shares, the authorization to repurchase our common stock. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. 58Table of ContentsDividends. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on February 10, 2012 and a cash dividend of $0.13 per share on each of May 4, August 9, and November 8, 2012, and February 15, 2013.Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2012: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period($ in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsDebt (1)$3,397 $511 $508 $1,222 $1,156Capital lease obligations (1)54 3 46 2 3Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse978 113 219 181 465Nonrecourse272 13 29 26 204Operating leases where we are secondarily liable17 11 6 — —Purchase obligations35 32 3 — —Other long-term liabilities51 — 7 4 40Total contractual obligations$4,804 $683 $818 $1,435 $1,868 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2012 of $29 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. We anticipate resolving an international issue related to financing activity during the next 12 months related to an unrecognized tax balance of $5 million. Although the resolution of this issue could have a significant impact on our unrecognized tax balance, we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our financial statements. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” to our Financial Statements for more information.In addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels that we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year-end 2012:Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal guarantees where we are the primary obligor$224 $15 $60 $63 $86Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable239 59 83 43 54Total guarantee commitments$463 $74 $143 $106 $140In conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner.59Table of ContentsWe also had the following investment commitments outstanding at year-end 2012:Investment Commitments Amount of Investment Commitments ExpectedFunding by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal investment commitments$107 $28 $79 $— $—For further information on our investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments and Letters of Credit” caption within Footnote No. 14, “Contingencies,” to our Financial Statements.At year-end 2012, we also had $68 million of letters of credit outstanding ($67 million outside the Credit Facility and $1 million under our Credit Facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2012 totaled $120 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally vary from 10 to 49 percent. For other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 19, “Related Party Transactions,” to our Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on:Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures;Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies;60Table of ContentsIncome Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; andLoan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans, including information on how we measure impairment on these types of loans.OTHER MATTERSInflationInflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2012, our investments had a fair value of $56 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year-end 2012, our Balance Sheet included a $2 million asset for currency exchange derivatives. Please see Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Financial Statements for more information on derivative instruments.61Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2012 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$54 $43 $60 $— $— $44 $201 $199Average interest rate 3.99% Floating-rate notes receivable$8 $12 $4 $1 $— $16 $41 $34Average interest rate 1.04% Liabilities-Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(406) $(6) $(316) $(296) $(300) $(1,045) $(2,369) $(2,153)Average interest rate 4.78% Floating-rate debt$— $— $— $(516) $— $— $(516) $(516)Average interest rate 0.38% 62Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:19.833799
1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverview We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 72 countries and territories under numerous brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2013, of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide, we operated 42 percent under management agreements; our franchisees operated 55 percent under franchise agreements; and we owned or leased only two percent. The remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties. We group our operations into four business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, and Luxury.We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (""above-property""). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in the system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. In 2013, we successfully launched Mobile Check-In at 350 Marriott Hotels both in North America and select international locations.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. 25Table of ContentsPerformance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (""RevPAR""), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which both correlate with RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.References to year-end 2013 RevPAR statistics, including occupancy and average daily rate, throughout this report reflect the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. References to RevPAR statistics, including occupancy and average daily rate, have not been modified to a calendar basis for year-end 2012 compared to year-end 2011. Accordingly, these statistics reflect the 52-week period ended December 28, 2012 compared to the 52-week period ended December 30, 2011, with the exception of The Ritz-Carlton and Autograph Collection brand properties and properties located outside of the United States where statistics are for the twelve months ended for each year presented, consistent with historic presentation. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and have not, in either the current or previous periods presented, (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Comparable properties represented the following percentage of our properties for the years ended 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively: (1) 89%, 93%, and 94% of North American properties; (2) 75%, 78%, and 79% of International properties; and (3) 87%, 91%, and 92% of total properties.We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Results Conditions for our business continued to improve in 2013, reflecting generally low supply growth in the United States (""U.S.""), global improving economic climate in many markets around the world, improved pricing in most markets, and a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system. Demand was particularly strong at luxury properties, followed by full-service properties, and limited-service properties. Comparable worldwide systemwide average daily rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 increased 3.4 percent on a constant dollar basis to $143.33, RevPAR increased 4.6 percent to $102.46, and occupancy increased 0.9 percentage points to 71.5 percent, compared to the same period a year ago. Continuing economic uncertainty in the U.S. and U.S. government sequestration had a dampening effect on short-term group customer demand through the 2013 first half. Short-term group customer demand improved in the 2013 second half, benefiting from better attendance at group functions. Group bookings in the 2013 second half for future short-term group business also improved. Government and government-related demand was constrained due to government spending restrictions and the U.S. federal government shutdown in October, particularly in Washington, D.C. and the surrounding areas. Transient demand was particularly strong in the western U.S., which allowed us to continue eliminating discounts, shifting business into higher rated price categories, and raising room rates. In the northeast U.S., weak group demand in the region in the first half of 2013, new supply in the city of New York, and weak government and government-related business in Washington, D.C., further impacted by the government shutdown, constrained RevPAR improvement. Leisure destinations in the U.S. had strong demand. The properties in our system serve both transient and group customers. Business transient and leisure transient demand in the U.S. was strong in 2013. For group business, two-thirds is typically booked before the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. Also, during an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. During the recent U.S. economic recession, organizers of large group meetings 26Table of Contentsscheduled smaller and fewer meetings to take place in 2013 than was previously typical. As the U.S. economy recovered, we replaced this lower level of large advance-purchase groups with smaller, last-minute group bookings and transient business. Last-minute group demand weakened during the first half of 2013, largely driven by weak corporate business and soft government demand at many properties, but corporate demand improved in the 2013 second half. U.S. government group demand weakened further as the year progressed, significantly impacted by the government shutdown in the 2013 fourth quarter. Short-term group demand shortfalls in the 2013 first half were largely mitigated by strong transient demand leading to strong occupancy rates. At the same time, as transient guests typically spend less on food and beverage than group customers, property-level food and beverage revenues increased year-over-year more slowly than room revenue. In addition, spending on food and beverage in 2013 was constrained by the somewhat uncertain economic climate and government spending restrictions in the U.S. As of year-end 2013, our group revenue booking pace for company-operated Marriott Hotels brand properties in North America is up over 4 percent for stays in 2014, compared to year-end 2012 booking pace for stays in 2013, reflecting improved group demand and greater pricing power.Outside of North America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Northern United Kingdom had strong demand in 2013 while Western Europe experienced moderate RevPAR growth. London RevPAR declined in the first three quarters of 2013, reflecting tough comparisons to last year's summer Olympic Games, but improved in the 2013 fourth quarter. Demand in France weakened as the year progressed. Demand remained weak in European markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply and weak economies constrained RevPAR growth in a few markets. In the Middle East, demand was strong in the United Arab Emirates, but weakened further in Egypt (particularly in the second half of 2013), Jordan, and Qatar. Demand in the Asia Pacific region continued to moderate, as our hotels in China experienced weaker government-related travel, moderating economic growth, and new supply in several markets. Thailand and Indonesia had higher demand and strong RevPAR growth in 2013.We monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. We also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2013, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements.CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2013, 2012, and 2011 (which included the results of the former Timeshare segment before the spin-off). In late 2011, we completed the spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business. Accordingly, we no longer have a Timeshare segment and instead earn license fees that we do not allocate to any of our segments and include in ""other unallocated corporate."" See Footnote No. 15, ""Spin-off"" for additional information. Revenues 2013 Compared to 2012Revenues increased by $970 million (8 percent) to $12,784 million in 2013 from $11,814 million in 2012 as a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($886 million), higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), and higher incentive management fees ($24 million, comprised of a $27 million increase for North America and a $3 million decrease outside of North America), partially offset by lower owned, leased, and other revenue ($39 million). We estimate that the $970 million increase in revenues included $8 million of combined base management fee, franchise fee, and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $10,291 million in 2013 from $9,405 million in 2012, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system. 27Table of ContentsThe $40 million increase in total base management fees, to $621 million in 2013 from $581 million in 2012, mainly reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($18 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($18 million), primarily driven by Gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the additional four days of activity (approximately $3 million). The $59 million increase in total franchise fees, to $666 million in 2013 from $607 million in 2012, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($22 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($23 million), increased relicensing fees primarily for certain North American Limited-Service properties ($8 million), and the additional four days of activity (approximately $5 million). The $24 million increase in incentive management fees from $232 million in 2012 to $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher property-level income at managed hotels ($33 million), particularly full-service hotels in North America, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items: recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million) and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million).The $39 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $950 million in 2013 from $989 million in 2012, primarily reflected $35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and $28 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue. Lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer International segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in London, as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $118 million in 2013 and $106 million in 2012.2012 Compared to 2011Revenues decreased by $503 million (4 percent) to $11,814 million in 2012 from $12,317 million in 2011. As detailed later in this report in the table under the caption ""Former Timeshare Segment - 2012 Compared to 2011,"" the spin-off contributed to a net $1,282 million decrease in revenues. This decrease was partially offset by a $779 million increase in revenues in our lodging business. The $779 million increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($757 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million, comprised of an $18 million increase for North America and a $19 million increase outside of North America), and higher base management fees ($35 million), partially offset by lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($94 million, which includes a $70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section). The $562 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $9,405 million in 2012 from $8,843 million in 2011, reflected a $757 million increase (allocated across our lodging business) resulting from higher property-level demand and growth across our system, partially offset by a net $195 million decline in timeshare-related cost reimbursements due to the spin-off. The $21 million decrease in total base management fees, to $581 million in 2012 from $602 million in 2011, primarily reflected a decline of $56 million in former Timeshare segment ($51 million) and International segment ($5 million) base management fees due to the spin-off, partially offset by a net increase of $35 million across our lodging business. The $35 million net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($24 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($9 million), as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of $7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a North American-Limited Service joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and the unfavorable impact of $3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions. The $101 million increase in total franchise fees, to $607 million in 2012 from $506 million in 2011, primarily reflected an increase of $57 million in license fees from MVW and an increase of $44 million across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger RevPAR ($27 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($13 million). The $37 million increase in incentive management fees from $195 million in 2011 to $232 million in 2012 primarily reflected higher net property-level income ($30 million), new unit growth, net of terminations ($6 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million).The $94 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $989 million in 2012 from $1,083 million in 2011, primarily reflected $70 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay® corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter, $29 million of lower owned and leased revenue, and $3 million of lower 28Table of Contentstermination fees, partially offset by $7 million of higher branding fees and $3 million of higher other revenue. The $29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected: (1) $34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our International segment, primarily driven by three hotels that left the system ($18 million), weaker demand at three other hotels ($6 million), two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties ($5 million), and unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million); and (2) $23 million of lower revenue at a North American Full-Service segment property that converted from leased to managed at year-end 2011; partially offset by (3) $14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in London due to strong demand, in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games; and (4) $10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in Japan. The property in Japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $106 million in 2012 and $99 million in 2011.Operating Income2013 Compared to 2012Operating income increased by $48 million to $988 million in 2013 from $940 million in 2012. The $48 million increase in operating income reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $6 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by an $81 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses. Approximately $7 million of the net increase in operating income was due to the additional four days of activity in 2013. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2012 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $6 million (4 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue, partially offset by $17 million of lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses. Lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was primarily due to $7 million in costs related to three International segment leases we terminated, $5 million in lower results at one leased property in London, $7 million in pre-opening expenses for the London and Miami EDITION hotels, and a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company for our leased property in Japan, partially offset by $4 million in net favorable results at several leased properties.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $81 million (13 percent) to $726 million in 2013 from $645 million in 2012. The $81 million increase largely reflected the following 2013 items: (1) $32 million increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets, higher costs for hotel development, and higher costs for branding and service initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally; (2) $26 million of higher compensation and other overhead expenses including increases in hotel development staffing and bonus compensation; (3) $18 million of impairment and accelerated amortization expense for deferred contract acquisition costs primarily for properties that left our system or which had cash flow shortfalls; (4) a $5 million performance cure payment for an International segment property; (5) $4 million of higher amortization expense year over year for deferred contract acquisition costs related to the 2012 Gaylord brand and hotel management company acquisition; and (6) a $4 million increase in legal expenses, primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2012. These increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs in 2012 for a property that exited our system. The $81 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses included $27 million that we did not allocate to any of our segments, and $54 million that we allocated as follows: $18 million to our International segment, $19 million to our Luxury segment, $15 million to our North American Full-Service segment, and $2 million to our North American Limited-Service segment. 2012 Compared to 2011Operating income increased by $414 million to $940 million in 2012 from $526 million in 2011. The $414 million increase in operating income reflected a net $265 million favorable variance due to the spin-off (which included $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2011. See Footnote No. 15, ""Spin-off"" for additional information on these charges.), as detailed in the table under the caption ""Former Timeshare Segment - 2012 Compared to 2011,"" and a $149 million increase across our lodging business. This $149 million increase across our lodging business reflected a $44 million increase in franchise fees, a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, $25 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and an $8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees across our lodging business compared to 2011 in the preceding “Revenues” section. 29Table of ContentsThe $25 million (18 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $19 million of net stronger results, particularly at one leased property in Japan ($9 million) and one leased property in London ($8 million), $7 million of higher branding fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue, partially offset by $3 million of lower termination fees. Our leased property in London benefited from strong demand and higher property-level margins in 2012 in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games, while our leased property in Japan experienced strong demand in 2012, benefiting from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $107 million (14 percent) to $645 million in 2012 from $752 million in 2011. The $107 million decrease reflected a decline of $99 million due to the spin-off (consisting of $63 million of former Timeshare segment general, administrative, and other expenses and $36 million of other expenses not previously allocated to the former Timeshare segment, including $34 million of Timeshare spin-off costs and $2 million of other expenses), and a decline of $8 million across our lodging business. The $8 million decrease across our lodging business was primarily a result of: (1) favorable variances from the following 2011 items: (a) a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both for one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; (b) a $5 million performance cure payment for a North American Full-Service property; and (c) $8 million for a guarantee accrual for one North American Full-Service property and the write-off of contract acquisition costs for several other properties; and (2) $11 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012, primarily associated with four properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released; (3) a favorable litigation settlement, partially offset by higher legal expenses, netting to a favorable $3 million; and (4) $2 million in decreased expenses due to favorable foreign exchange rates. These favorable items were partially offset by: (1) the following unfavorable 2012 items: (a) $20 million of increased compensation and other overhead expenses; and (b) the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisitions costs for a North American Full-Service segment property (for which we earned a termination fee that we recorded in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue); and (2) the unfavorable variance for a $5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows. See ""BUSINESS SEGMENTS: North American Full-Service Lodging"" for more information on the termination fee and the related accelerated amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs recorded in 2012. The $8 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses across our lodging business consisted of a $21 million decrease allocated to our Luxury segment, partially offset by an $11 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments and a $2 million increase allocated to our North American Full-Service segment. Gains (Losses) and Other IncomeWe show our gains (losses) and other income for 2013, 2012, and 2011 in the following table: ($ in millions)2013 2012 2011Gains on sales of real estate and other$2 $27 $11Gain on sale of joint venture and other investments9 21 —Income from cost method joint ventures— 2 —Impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities— (8) (18) $11 $42 $(7)2013 Compared to 2012 Gains and other income decreased by $31 million (74 percent) to $11 million in 2013 compared to $42 million in 2012. This decrease in gains and other income principally reflected an unfavorable variance from the $41 million gain we recognized in 2012 on the sale of the equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture which we discuss in the following ""2012 Compared to 2011"" discussion, and a $2 million impairment loss we recognized in 2013 as a result of measuring certain assets at fair value less the costs we incurred to sell those assets. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisition and Dispositions"" for more information on the reclassification of these assets to held for sale. The decrease in gains and other income was partially offset by a gain of $8 million we recognized in 2013 on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company and a favorable variance from an other-than-temporary $7 million impairment we recorded in 2012 which we discuss in the following ""2012 Compared to 2011"" discussion. 30Table of Contents2012 Compared to 2011In 2012, we recognized a total gain of $41 million on the sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) which consisted of: (1) a $21 million gain on the sale of this interest reflected in the ""Gain on sale of joint venture and other investments"" caption in the preceding table; and (2) recognition of the $20 million remaining gain we deferred in 2005 due to contingencies in the original transaction documents for the sale of land to one of the joint ventures, reflected in the ""Gains on sales of real estate and other"" caption in the preceding table. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" for more information on the sale of this equity interest.The ""Impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities"" line in the preceding table reflects the other-than-temporary impairment in 2012 of two cost method joint venture investments and the other-than-temporary impairment in 2011 of marketable equity securities. For more information on the $7 million impairment of one of the cost method joint venture investments in 2012, see Footnote No. 4, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” For more information on the impairment of marketable equity securities in 2011, see Footnote No. 4, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” of the 2012 Form 10-K.Interest Expense2013 Compared to 2012Interest expense decreased by $17 million (12 percent) to $120 million in 2013 compared to $137 million in 2012. This decrease in interest expense principally reflected a net $13 million decrease due to net Senior Note retirements and new Senior Note issuances at lower interest rates; and $3 million of increased capitalized interest primarily related to developing two EDITION hotels, partially offset by completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter.2012 Compared to 2011Interest expense decreased by $27 million (16 percent) to $137 million in 2012 compared to $164 million in 2011. This decrease reflected a $29 million decrease due to the spin-off, partially offset by a $2 million increase for our lodging business. The $29 million decrease in interest expense due to the spin-off consisted of interest expense in 2011 that was allocated to the former Timeshare segment ($43 million), partially offset by interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for costs that were a component of ""Timeshare-direct"" expenses before the spin-off ($8 million) and the unfavorable variance to 2011 for capitalized interest expense for construction projects for our former Timeshare segment ($6 million). For the $8 million of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing spin-off obligations, we also recorded $8 million of ""Interest income"" in 2012 for the associated notes receivable. The $2 million increase in interest expense for our lodging business was primarily for the Series K Notes and the Series L Notes we issued in 2012 ($23 million) as well as increased interest expense for our Marriott Rewards program and our commercial paper program, reflecting higher average balances and interest rates ($2 million), partially offset by increased capitalized interest expense principally for lodging construction projects ($15 million) and the absence of interest expense for the Series F Senior Notes following our repayment of those notes in 2012 ($9 million). See the ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES"" caption later in this report for more information on our credit facility. Interest Income and Income Tax 2013 Compared to 2012Interest income increased by $6 million (35 percent) to $23 million in 2013 compared to $17 million in 2012, primarily reflecting $5 million earned on the $65 million mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest we acquired in the 2013 second quarter. See Footnote No. 4, ""Fair Value of Financial Instruments"" for more information on the acquisition.Our tax provision decreased by $7 million (3 percent) to $271 million in 2013 from $278 million in 2012. The decrease resulted from a lower effective tax rate (30.2 percent in 2013 compared to 32.7 percent in 2012), favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments in 2013, favorable variance from a reserve recorded for an international tax issue in 2012, a favorable state tax adjustment in 2013, and higher income before income taxes in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. with lower tax rates, partially offset by higher income tax expense in the U.S.2012 Compared to 2011Interest income increased by $3 million (21 percent) to $17 million in 2012 compared to $14 million in 2011, primarily reflecting $9 million of increased interest income for two notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spin-off, partially offset by a $6 million decrease primarily from the repayment of certain loans. For $8 million of the $9 million increase 31Table of Contentsin interest income in 2012 for notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spin-off, we also recorded $8 million of ""Interest expense"" in 2012 for ongoing obligations for those notes. Our tax provision increased by $120 million (76 percent) to $278 million in 2012 from $158 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the absence of timeshare pre-tax losses in 2012 due to the spin-off and the effect of higher pre-tax income from our lodging business, as well as a lower percentage of lodging pre-tax income in 2012 from jurisdictions outside the U.S. with lower tax rates. These increases in the provision were partially offset by a favorable variance from $34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets transferred to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off. Equity in Losses2013 Compared to 2012 Equity in losses of $5 million in 2013 improved by $8 million from equity in losses of $13 million in 2012. The change primarily reflected a favorable variance from the following 2012 items: (1) $8 million in losses at a Luxury segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties; and (2) a $2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another Luxury segment joint venture. These favorable variances were partially offset by a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate joint venture (not allocated to one of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we did not expect to recover the investment.2012 Compared to 2011Equity in losses of $13 million in 2012 was unchanged from equity in losses of $13 million in 2011, and reflected a $4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business, entirely offset by a $4 million unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spin-off. The $4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business primarily reflected $3 million of increased earnings at two International segment joint ventures, $3 million of decreased losses at two other joint ventures, and a $3 million favorable variance from the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) which had losses in the prior year, partially offset by $3 million of increased losses at a Luxury segment joint venture, and a $2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another Luxury segment joint venture. The $3 million of increased losses at a Luxury segment joint venture reflected increased losses of $8 million primarily from the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012, partially offset by $5 million of decreased losses in 2012, after the impairment, as a result of decreased joint venture costs. The $4 million unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spin-off reflected the $4 million reversal in 2011 of the funding liability associated with Timeshare-strategy impairment charges we originally recorded in 2009. See Footnote No. 18, ""Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges"" of our 2011 Form 10-K for additional information on this reversal. Net Income2013 Compared to 2012Net income increased by $55 million to $626 million in 2013 from $571 million in 2012, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.28 per share (16 percent) to $2.00 per share from $1.72 per share in 2012. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” or as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the $55 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), higher incentive management fees ($24 million), lower interest expense ($17 million), lower equity in losses ($8 million), lower income taxes ($7 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($6 million), and higher interest income ($6 million). These increases were partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million) and lower gains and other income ($31 million).2012 Compared to 2011Net income increased by $373 million to $571 million in 2012 from $198 million in 2011, and diluted earnings per share increased by $1.17 per share (213 percent) to $1.72 per share from $0.55 per share in 2011. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” or as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the $373 million increase in net income was due to the impact of the spin-off ($296 million), as well as the following increases across our lodging business: higher gains and other income ($52 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million), higher base management fees ($35 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($25 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($8 million), and lower 32Table of Contentsequity in losses ($4 million). These increases were partially offset by higher income taxes ($120 million) as well as the following decreases across our lodging business: lower interest income ($6 million) and higher interest expense ($2 million).Former Timeshare Segment - 2012 Compared to 2011The following tables facilitate the comparison of 2012 to 2011 by detailing the components of our former Timeshare segment revenues and results for 2011, as well as certain items that we did not allocate to our Timeshare segment for 2011 while also showing the components of revenue, interest income and interest expense we received from MVW for 2012.

We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We, therefore, exclude depreciation and amortization expense. Effective with this report, we have also modified our EBITDA calculation to exclude depreciation and amortization expense that we classify in the ""Owned, leased, and corporate housing-direct expenses"" and ""General, administrative, and other expenses"" captions of our Income Statements; as well as the depreciation expense that third party owners reimburse to us that we classify in the ""Reimbursed costs"" caption of our Income Statements. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects: (1) an adjustment to exclude the $41 million pre-tax gain on the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture discussed earlier in the ""Gains and Other Income"" caption; and (2) beginning with this report, an adjustment to exclude share-based compensation expense for all years presented. Because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted, we excluded share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA that excludes these items is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and in particular Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting EBITDA's and Adjusted EBITDA's usefulness as comparative measures. We show our 2013 and 2012 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile those measures with Net Income in the following tables: 34Table of Contents($ in millions)2013Net Income$626Interest expense120Tax provision271Depreciation and amortization127Depreciation classified in Reimbursed costs48Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures4Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures13EBITDA$1,209Share-based compensation (including share-based compensation reimbursed by third-party owners)116Adjusted EBITDA$1,325 ($ in millions)2012Net Income$571Interest expense137Tax provision278Depreciation and amortization102Depreciation classified in Reimbursed costs45Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures11Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures20EBITDA$1,164Share-based compensation (including share-based compensation reimbursed by third-party owners)94Less: Gain on Courtyard JV sale, pre-tax(41)Adjusted EBITDA$1,217 35Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENTSWe are a diversified lodging company with operations in four business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, and Luxury. See Footnote No. 14, “Business Segments,” for further information. In addition to our four current segments, on November 21, 2011 we spun off our former timeshare operations and timeshare development business, which had until that time been our Timeshare segment, as a new independent company, MVW. See Footnote No. 14, “Business Segments,” for historical financial results of our former Timeshare segment and Footnote No. 15, ""Spin-off"" for more information. 36Table of ContentsAt year-end 2013, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties by segment: Total Lodging and Timeshare Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. TotalNorth American Full-Service Segment (1) Marriott Hotels 312 15 327 123,296 5,355 128,651Marriott Conference Centers10 — 10 2,915 — 2,915JW Marriott22 1 23 12,649 221 12,870Renaissance Hotels74 2 76 26,840 790 27,630Renaissance ClubSport2 — 2 349 — 349Gaylord Hotels5 — 5 8,098 — 8,098Autograph Collection32 — 32 8,410 — 8,410 457 18 475 182,557 6,366 188,923North American Limited-Service Segment (1) Courtyard836 21 857 117,693 3,835 121,528Fairfield Inn & Suites691 14 705 62,921 1,562 64,483SpringHill Suites306 2 308 35,888 299 36,187Residence Inn629 20 649 76,056 2,928 78,984TownePlace Suites222 2 224 22,039 278 22,317 2,684 59 2,743 314,597 8,902 323,499International Segment (1) Marriott Hotels— 159 159 — 45,858 45,858JW Marriott— 40 40 — 14,607 14,607Renaissance Hotels— 75 75 — 23,921 23,921Autograph Collection— 19 19 — 2,705 2,705Courtyard— 96 96 — 19,021 19,021Fairfield Inn & Suites— 3 3 — 482 482Residence Inn— 4 4 — 421 421Marriott Executive Apartments— 27 27 — 4,295 4,295 — 423 423 — 111,310 111,310Luxury Segment The Ritz-Carlton37 47 84 11,040 13,950 24,990Bulgari Hotels & Resorts— 3 3 — 202 202EDITION— 2 2 — 251 251The Ritz-Carlton-Residential(2)30 10 40 3,598 630 4,228The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments— 4 4 — 579 579 67 66 133 14,638 15,612 30,250Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Autograph Collection— 5 5 — 348 348AC Hotels by Marriott— 75 75 — 8,491 8,491 — 80 80 — 8,839 8,839 Timeshare (3)47 15 62 10,506 2,296 12,802 Total3,255 661 3,916 522,298 153,325 675,623 (1) North American includes properties located in the United States and Canada.

These figures do not include residential units. During 2013, we also added five residential properties (301 units) and no residential properties or units exited the system. Total segment financial results increased by $24 million to $1,197 million in 2013 from $1,173 million in 2012, and total segment revenues increased by $992 million to $12,518 million in 2013, a 9 percent increase from revenues of $11,526 million in 2012.The year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $992 million was a result of a $923 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, and a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue. The year-over-year increase of $24 million in segment results reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses, partially offset by a $54 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, $44 million of lower gains and other income, and a $9 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses. For more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2013, 39 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 33 percent in 2012. In addition, in 2013, 58 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 65 percent in 2012. In North America, 22 percent of managed properties paid incentive management fees to us in 2013, compared to 15 percent in 2012. Further, in North America, 20 North American Limited-Service segment properties, 19 North American Full-Service segment properties, and two Luxury segment properties earned a combined $8 million in incentive management fees in 2013, but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2012. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2012, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2013 increased by 90 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 6.2 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and lower energy costs. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 130 basis points compared to 2012. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 8.3 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 3.4 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity. Note that 2013 had four additional days of activity. 2012 Compared to 2011We added 122 properties (27,059 rooms) and 42 properties (8,883 rooms) exited our system in 2012. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. During 2012, we added three residential properties (89 units), and no residential properties or units exited the system. Total segment financial results increased by $408 million to $1,173 million in 2012 from $765 million in 2011, and total segment revenues decreased by $671 million to $11,526 million in 2012, a 6 percent decrease from revenues of $12,197 million in 2011. The $408 million increase in segment results reflected a $212 million favorable variance from the spin-off (which included $324 million of Timeshare strategy-impairment charges in 2011) and a net $196 million increase in segment results across our lodging business. The $671 million decrease in total segment revenues reflected a $1,443 million decrease due to the impact of the spin-off that was partially offset by a net $772 million increase across our lodging business.The year-over-year net increase in segment revenues across our lodging business of $772 million resulted from a $757 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income, a $44 million increase in franchise fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, and a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $101 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue. The $196 million year-over-year increase in segment results across our lodging business reflected a $44 million increase in franchise fees, $39 million of higher gains and other income, a $37 million increase in incentive management fees, a $35 million increase in base management fees, a $19 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, an $18 million increase in owned, 38Table of Contentsleased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses. For more detailed information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2012, 33 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 29 percent in 2011. In addition, in 2012, 65 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 67 percent in 2011. In North America, 15 percent of managed properties paid incentive management fees to us in 2012, compared to 13 percent in 2011. Further, in North America, 14 North American Full-Service segment properties, seven North American Limited-Service segment properties, and two Luxury segment properties earned a combined $13 million in incentive management fees in 2012, but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2011.See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2011, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2012 increased by 120 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 9.0 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and lower energy costs. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 140 basis points compared to 2011. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 9.9 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 90 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 7.3 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity.Development We added 161 properties, totaling 25,420 rooms, across our brands in 2013 and 51 properties (10,299 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added five residential properties (301 units) and no residential properties left the system. Highlights of the year included:•Converting 36 properties (6,266 rooms), or 24 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands, including eight properties joining our Autograph Collection brand in the United States. Twenty-three of the properties converted were located in the United States;•Adding approximately 41 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; and•Adding 108 properties (12,927 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands.We currently have over 195,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, as well as nearly 30,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. We expect the number of our hotel rooms (gross) to increase approximately six percent in 2014.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. 39Table of ContentsStatistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and our Luxury segment.

Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged compared to 2012. Higher base management and franchise fees stemmed from both higher RevPAR due to increased demand and unit growth, including the Gaylord brand properties we began managing in 2012, and also reflected fees for the additional four days of activity. The increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and margins. General, administrative, and other expenses reflected the following 2013 items: the $8 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs primarily related to two properties that left the system and one property that converted to a franchised property, $4 million of higher amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the Gaylord brand and hotel management company acquisition, and $9 million in other net miscellaneous cost increases. These increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the 2012 accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that exited our system and for which we earned a $14 million termination fee.Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged, primarily driven by our recognition in 2012 of a $14 million termination fee for one property, and our recognition in 2013 of $7 million in termination fees for five properties and $4 million of stronger results at two leased properties.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $5,896 million in 2013, compared to $5,325 million in 2012.2012 Compared to 2011In 2012, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 18 properties (11,444 rooms), including five properties from the Gaylord acquisition (8,098 rooms). Eight properties (3,569 rooms) left the system.In 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 6.4 percent to $109.93, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.8 percent to $156.30.The $56 million increase in segment results, compared to 2011, primarily reflected $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $15 million of higher incentive management fees, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $2 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.Higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, unit growth. The $15 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and margins.The $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $14 million termination fee for one property in 2012 and $3 million of net stronger owned and leased property results, primarily driven by 47Table of Contentstwo properties that left the system and had losses in the prior year, partially offset by $7 million of termination fees for two properties in 2011. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $2 million and primarily reflected the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for the property for which we earned the $14 million termination fee and $2 million of miscellaneous cost increases, partially offset by favorable variances from the following 2011 items: a $5 million performance cure payment we made for one property, a $2 million guarantee accrual for one property, and the write-off of contract acquisition costs totaling $2 million for two properties.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $5,325 million in 2012, compared to $4,862 million in 2011.North American Limited-Service includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and included Marriott ExecuStay until we sold that business in the 2012 second quarter.

The majority of the properties that left the system were Courtyard and Fairfield Inn & Suites properties. In the 2012 second quarter, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay corporate housing business. The revenues, results of operations, assets, and liabilities of our ExecuStay business were not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 4.4 percent to $82.52, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.7 percentage points to 71.8 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.4 percent to $115.00.The $6 million increase in segment results, compared to 2012, primarily reflected $45 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $4 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $43 million of lower gains and other income. Higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher RevPAR due to increased demand, some of which was attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations, and higher relicensing fees, as well as the additional four days of activity, partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of $7 million of deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture. The increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins. Lower gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a $41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture in 2012. See the ""Gains (Losses) and Other Income"" caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,957 million in 2013, compared to $1,842 million in 2012.2012 Compared to 2011In 2012, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 70 properties (8,470 rooms) and 16 properties (2,033 rooms) left the system. The majority of the properties that left the system were older Fairfield Inn properties. In the 2012 second quarter, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay corporate housing business, as discussed in the preceding ""2013 Compared to 2012"" caption. In 2012, we also completed the sale of an equity interest in a North American Limited-Service segment joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale), which did not result in any rooms leaving the system. 48Table of ContentsIn 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 6.3 percent to $79.07, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.3 percentage points to 71.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.4 percent to $111.12.The $90 million increase in segment results, compared to 2011, primarily reflected $43 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $41 million of higher gains and other income, $4 million of decreased joint venture equity losses, and $2 million of higher incentive management fees. Higher gains and other income reflected a $41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture.Higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR due to increased demand, some of which is attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations, and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth and our recognition of $7 million of deferred base management fees in 2012 in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture. The $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture which had losses in the prior year. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,842 million in 2012, compared to $1,687 million in 2011.International includes Marriott Hotels, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Autograph Collection, Courtyard, AC Hotels by Marriott, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the United States and Canada.

See ""Business and Overview"" for a discussion of results in the various International segment regions.The $32 million decrease in segment results in 2013, compared to 2012, predominantly reflected $18 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $11 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $7 million of lower incentive management fees, and $4 million of decreased joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher base management and franchise fees. The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected $14 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, $7 million of higher accounts receivable reserves primarily related to two properties, and a $5 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by a favorable variance from a $5 million guarantee accrual for one property in 2012. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected $7 million in costs related to three International segment leases we terminated, $5 million in weaker results at one leased property in London, and $5 million in weaker results at a leased property due to an asset write-off and the impact of renovations, partially offset by $5 million of higher termination fees principally associated with one property. Lower joint venture equity earnings were primarily driven by a renovation at a hotel in one joint venture and lower earnings at two other joint ventures. The increase in base management and franchise fees largely reflected new unit growth and higher RevPAR due to increased demand. The decrease in incentive management fees was primarily driven by a $3 million unfavorable impact from a contract revision for a property, a $3 million unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of previously deferred fees in 49Table of Contentsconjunction with a property's change in ownership, and a $3 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact. These were partially offset by $2 million in net new unit growth. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International segment properties totaled $905 million in 2013, compared to $682 million in 2012.2012 Compared to 2011In 2012, across our International segment we added 29 properties (6,418 rooms) and 18 properties (3,281 rooms) left the system, largely due to quality issues.In 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 5.0 percent to $111.45, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.9 percentage points to 71.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.2 percent to $156.47. Comparable company-operated RevPAR improved significantly in Thailand, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico, while Europe experienced more modest RevPAR increases. Demand remained particularly weak in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and markets in Europe more dependent on regional travel.The $17 million increase in segment results in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflected a $16 million increase in incentive management fees and $2 million of decreased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by a $1 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. Aggregate base management and franchise fees as well as general, administrative, and other expenses remained unchanged compared to 2011.The $16 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income associated with better RevPAR and margins ($10 million), new unit growth net of terminations ($3 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with a property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million). Aggregate base management and franchise fees were unchanged and reflected $5 million of lower base management fees due to the spin-off, offset by $5 million of higher base management and franchise fees across our lodging business. The decrease in base management fees due to the spin-off reflected fees that the International segment no longer receives from the timeshare business following the spin-off. The $5 million increase in base management and franchise fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($8 million), new unit growth net of terminations ($5 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and contract revisions for certain properties ($3 million).The $2 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased earnings at two joint ventures. The $1 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $8 million of lower termination fees in 2012, partially offset by net stronger results principally at a leased property in London in 2012 which had increased demand. General, administrative, and other expenses remained unchanged and primarily reflected $6 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, almost entirely offset by $3 million of lower accounts receivable reserves, and a $2 million guarantee accrual reversal in 2012 for one property where we were released of the guarantee. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International segment properties totaled $682 million in 2012, compared to $621 million in 2011.Luxury includes The Ritz-Carlton, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, and EDITION worldwide.

Higher base management fees stemmed from a favorable variance from $3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties with contract revisions, increased RevPAR due to increased demand, and new unit growth. The decrease in joint venture equity losses reflected a favorable variance from $8 million in losses in 2012 at a Luxury segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties. The increase in incentive management fees was primarily driven by higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins. The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of termination fees for two properties, offset by $7 million of pre-opening expenses for the London and Miami EDITION hotels. The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected an unfavorable variance from $8 million in reversals of guarantee accruals in 2012 for three properties and the following 2013 items: (1) a $3 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that left our system; (2) a $2 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property with cash flow shortfalls; (3) $4 million of higher expenses to support our growth; and (4) $2 million of other net miscellaneous cost increases. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,442 million in 2013, compared to $1,428 million in 2012.2012 Compared to 2011In 2012, across our Luxury segment we added four properties (499 rooms) and no properties left the system. In 2012, we also added three residential products (89 units). No residential products left the system.In 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide luxury properties increased by 6.0 percent to $220.33, occupancy increased by 1.0 percentage points to 67.0 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.4 percent to $328.68.The $28 million increase in segment results, compared to 2011, reflected a $21 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $4 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by $3 million of increased joint venture equity losses and $3 million of decreased gains and other income. The $21 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both recognized in 2011 and both for one property whose owner filed for bankruptcy, as well as $8 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012 for three properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released.The $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $9 million increase associated with our leased property in Japan (which experienced very low demand in 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami and received a $2 million business interruption payment in 2012 from a utility company). The $4 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth. The $3 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased losses of $8 million, principally for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012, partially offset by $5 million of decreased losses after the impairment, as a result of decreased joint venture costs. The $3 million decrease in gains and other income primarily reflected the impairment of a cost method joint venture investment.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,428 million in 2012, compared to $1,350 million in 2011. 51Table of ContentsSHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock (“Stock Appreciation Right Program”); (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that equal the market price of our common stock on the date of grant.During 2013, we granted 2.5 million RSUs, 0.2 million service and performance RSUs, 0.7 million Employee SARs, and 0.1 million stock options. See Footnote No. 3, “Share-Based Compensation,” for more information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSWe do not expect that accounting standard updates issued to date and that are effective after December 31, 2013, will have a material effect on our Financial Statements. 52Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOn July 18, 2013, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") to extend the facility's expiration to July 18, 2018 and increase the facility size to $2,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings. The material terms of the amended and restated Credit Facility are otherwise unchanged. The facility supports general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For more information on our Credit Facility, see Exhibit 10, “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on July 19, 2013.The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2013, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1,291 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,165 million under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $126 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $2,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $834 million of outstanding commercial paper and $1 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of Senior Notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2013 2012 2011Cash from operations$1,140 $989 $1,089Depreciation expense59 48 87Amortization expense68 54 57 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2013 and 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2012. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. 53Table of ContentsOur ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years2013 2012 2011 2010 20095.1x 4.6x 2.3x 2.9x * * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million.Timeshare Cash FlowsWhile our former Timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments. We show the 2011 net operating activity from our former Timeshare segment before the spin-off (which did not include income from our former Timeshare segment) in the following table. New Timeshare segment mortgages totaled $214 million in 2011 and collections totaled $273 million in 2011 (which included collections on securitized notes of $187 million).($ in millions)2011 Timeshare segment development less than cost of sales$97 Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages)59 Financially reportable sales less than closed sales3 Other cash inflows12 Net cash inflows from former Timeshare segment activity$171 As noted in Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” all tax matters that could affect the Company's cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in the 2013 first quarter, and we expect that the spin-off will result in our realization through 2015 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. We realized $363 million of cash tax benefits through 2013, of which $135 million of those benefits were realized in 2013. We expect to realize approximately $52 million in 2014. For more information on the spin-off, see Footnote No. 15, ""Spin-off.""Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $404 million in 2013, $437 million in 2012, and $183 million in 2011. These included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2013 decreased by $33 million compared to 2012, primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of land and a building we plan to develop into a hotel in our Luxury segment, partially offset by the 2013 acquisition of a managed property in our North American Full-Service segment. Contract acquisition costs in 2013 decreased by $192 million compared to 2012, primarily due to the $192 million acquisition of the Gaylord hotel management company in 2012. Separately, we classified the $18 million acquisition of the Gaylord brand name in 2012 as ""Other investing activities."" Capital expenditures in 2012 increased by $254 million compared to 2011, primarily due to the acquisition of land and a building, renovations of buildings associated with developing three EDITION hotels, and the acquisition of land for an EDITION hotel. Contract acquisitions costs in 2012 increased by $179 million compared to 2011, primarily due to the $192 million acquisition of the Gaylord hotel management company. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions,"" for more information on these acquisitions. We expect 2014 investment spending will total approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including approximately $150 million for maintenance capital spending and approximately $186 million for Protea. Investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. 54Table of ContentsOver time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated no cash proceeds in 2013, $65 million in 2012, and $20 million in 2011. See Footnote No. 7, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions,"" for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $70 million in 2013 and $138 million in 2012. At year-end 2013, we had a $3 million long-term senior loan and $175 million of mezzanine and other loans ($142 million long-term and $36 million short-term) outstanding, compared with a $15 million long-term senior loan and $227 million of mezzanine and other loans ($165 million long-term and $62 million short-term) outstanding at year-end 2012. In 2013, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $64 million, primarily reflecting collections on two MVW notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with the Timeshare spin-off. See the “Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans” caption in Footnote No. 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.""Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $16 million in 2013, $15 million in 2012, and $83 million in 2011 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt increased by $264 million in 2013, to $3,199 million at year-end 2013 from $2,935 million at year-end 2012, and reflected our 2013 third quarter issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series M Senior Notes and a $333 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by the $400 million (book value) retirement, at maturity, of our Series J Senior Notes, $15 million in decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility, and decreases of $2 million in other debt (which includes capital leases). Debt increased by $764 million in 2012, to $2,935 million at year-end 2012 from $2,171 million at year-end 2011, and reflected our 2012 issuance of $594 million (book value) of Series K Senior Notes, our 2012 issuance of $349 million (book value) of Series L Senior Notes, a $170 million increase in commercial paper, and $15 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, partially offset by the $348 million (book value) retirement, at maturity, of our Series F Senior Notes and decreases of $16 million in other debt (which includes capital leases). See Footnote No. 10, ""Long-Term Debt"" for additional information on the debt issuances. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2013, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 3.5 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.1 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2013.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases. We purchased 20.0 million shares of our common stock in 2013 at an average price of $41.46 per share, purchased 31.2 million shares in 2012 at an average price of $37.15 per share, and purchased 43.4 million shares in 2011 at an average price of $32.79 per share. As of year-end 2013, 14.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. On February 14, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors increased, by 25 million shares, the authorization to repurchase our common stock. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share on February 15, 2013 and a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on each of May 10, August 8, and November 7, 2013, and February 14, 2014. 55Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2013: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period($ in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsDebt (1)$3,638 $112 $796 $1,247 $1,483Capital lease obligations (1)53 47 2 2 2Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse890 120 218 162 390Nonrecourse264 14 30 27 193Operating leases where we are secondarily liable4 4 — — —Purchase obligations152 107 45 — —Other long-term liabilities48 — 4 4 40Total contractual obligations$5,049 $404 $1,095 $1,442 $2,108 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2013 of $34 million.

Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2013 totaled $122 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. We also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally vary from 10 to 49 percent. Undistributed earnings attributable to our equity method investments represented approximately $2 million of our consolidated retained earnings at year-end 2013. For other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 18, “Related Party Transactions.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on:Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures;Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies;Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; andLoan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans, including information on how we measure impairment on these types of loans.OTHER MATTERS InflationInflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 57Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2013, our investments had a fair value of $41 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Footnote No. 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information on derivative instruments. 58Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2013 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets-Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$35 $82 $3 $3 $5 $36 $164 $163Average interest rate 4.27% Floating-rate notes receivable$1 $3 $1 $— $— $9 $14 $18Average interest rate 0.33% Liabilities-Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(6) $(319) $(297) $(300) $(9) $(1,384) $(2,315) $(2,432)Average interest rate 4.56% Floating-rate debt$— $— $— $— $(834) $— $(834) $(834)Average interest rate 0.43% 59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:20.230110

Also, for periods prior to 2009, we reclassified our provision for loan losses associated with our lodging operations to the “General, administrative, and other” caption of our Income Statements to conform to our presentation for periods beginning in 2009. This reclassification only affected operating income.(3) We adopted certain provisions of Accounting Standards Certification Topic 978 (previously Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions”), in 2006, which we reported in our Income Statements as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.(4) The following businesses became discontinued operations in the year we announced that we would sell or exit them: senior living services (2002), distribution services (2002), and synthetic fuel (2007).(5) We issued stock dividends in the third and fourth quarters of 2009, and a stock split in the form of a stock dividend on June 9, 2006. We have adjusted all per share data retroactively to reflect those stock dividends.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverview We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 79 countries and territories under numerous brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2014, of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide, we operated 41 percent under management agreements; our franchisees operated 56 percent under franchise agreements; and we owned or leased only two percent. The remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties. We group our operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International.We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in the system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.References to year-end 2014 RevPAR statistics throughout this report, including occupancy and ADR, reflect the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. 24Table of ContentsWe define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the current period and have not, in either the current or previous periods presented, (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated: (1) 87% of North American properties in 2014, 89% in 2013, and 93% in 2012; (2) 57% of International properties (71% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, 75% in 2013, and 78% in 2012; and (3) 82% of total properties (85% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, 87% in 2013, and 91% in 2012.We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Business Trends Our 2014 results reflected a favorable economic climate and demand for our brands in many markets around the world, reflecting generally low supply growth in the U.S. and Europe, improved pricing in most North American markets, and a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2014 increased 6.6 percent to $110.09, average daily rates increased 3.7 percent on a constant dollar basis to $150.23, and occupancy increased 2.0 percentage points to 73.3 percent, compared to 2013. The properties in our system serve transient and group customers, which drive both business and leisure demand. In 2014, three-quarters of property group room revenue was contracted before 2014 and one-quarter was contracted in 2014. As group demand has improved, meeting planners have been booking such meetings earlier to ensure available space.Strong U.S. group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2014. Transient demand continued to be strong in the western U.S. during 2014, and was stronger beginning in the third quarter in the eastern U.S. when compared to the first half of the year, as we eliminated discounts, shifted business into higher rated price categories, and raised room rates. In New York City, new lodging supply continued to constrain rate growth, while in Washington D.C., demand strengthened in the second half of the year due to increased city-wide events and a favorable comparison to the 2013 government sequestration and shutdown. In 2014, bookings for future group business in the U.S. improved. As of year-end 2014, the group revenue pace for stays in 2015 for company-operated full service hotels (Marriott, JW Marriott, Renaissance, The Ritz-Carlton, and Gaylord brands) in North America was up about 5 percent, compared to the 2013 year-end group revenue booking pace for stays in 2014. The higher pace reflected improved group demand and greater pricing power.The Europe region experienced increased demand throughout 2014, most predominately in the United Kingdom and Central Europe primarily due to increased business travel and special events, whereas results in France reflected the impact of a weaker economy. Eastern Europe was impacted by lower demand, constrained by continued economic deterioration due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. In the Asia Pacific region, 2014 demand continued to increase, led by growth from corporate and other transient business in Japan, Indonesia, India, and Singapore. Demand increased in Greater China in the first three quarters of 2014 but was also constrained by supply growth in certain Southern China markets and government austerity in Beijing. In the fourth quarter, demand moderated in Greater China due to political disruption in Hong Kong. Demand in Malaysia was weak in 2014 due to slower leisure travel from Greater China. Thailand demand was weak due to political instability through most of 2014 but increased in the fourth quarter. Demand for our hotels in our Middle East and Africa regions remained strong throughout 2014. In particular, demand in Egypt improved due to improved political stability. Demand in the United Arab Emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in travelers from Russia in the second half of the year, while Kuwait experienced weakness due to reduced government spending. In the Caribbean and Latin America, strong demand throughout the region in 2014 was driven by increased leisure travel to our Caribbean and Mexican resorts, constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in Panama. We monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. We also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2014, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. For our company- 25Table of Contentsoperated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2014, 2013, and 2012.Revenues 2014 Compared to 2013Revenues increased by $1,012 million (8 percent) to $13,796 million in 2014 from $12,784 million in 2013 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue ($764 million), higher franchise fees ($79 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue ($72 million), higher base management fees ($51 million), and higher incentive management fees ($46 million). We estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $11,055 million in 2014 from $10,291 million in 2013, reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across the system. The $51 million increase in total base management fees, to $672 million in 2014 from $621 million in 2013, largely reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million). The $79 million increase in total franchise fees, to $745 million in 2014 from $666 million in 2013, reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across the system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million). The $46 million increase in incentive management fees to $302 million in 2014 from $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher net house profit at our North American and International managed hotels in addition to unit growth in International markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher North American Full-Service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million). The $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $1,022 million in 2014 from $950 million in 2013 predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various Protea Hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. Higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from Protea Hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased properties primarily from the International segment, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five International segment properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013.2013 Compared to 2012Revenues increased by $970 million (8 percent) to $12,784 million in 2013 from $11,814 million in 2012 as a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($886 million), higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), and higher incentive management fees ($24 million, comprised of a $27 million increase for North America and a $3 million decrease outside of North America), partially offset by lower owned, leased, and other revenue ($39 million). We estimate that the $970 million increase in revenues included $8 million of combined base management fee, franchise fee, and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $10,291 million in 2013 from $9,405 million in 2012, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system. 26Table of ContentsThe $40 million increase in total base management fees, to $621 million in 2013 from $581 million in 2012, mainly reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($18 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($18 million), primarily driven by Gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the additional four days of activity (approximately $3 million). The $59 million increase in total franchise fees, to $666 million in 2013 from $607 million in 2012, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($22 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($23 million), increased relicensing fees primarily for certain North American Limited-Service properties ($8 million), and the additional four days of activity (approximately $5 million). The $24 million increase in incentive management fees from $232 million in 2012 to $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher property-level income at managed hotels ($33 million), particularly full-service hotels in North America, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items: recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million) and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million).The $39 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $950 million in 2013 from $989 million in 2012, primarily reflected $35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and $28 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue. Lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer International segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in London, as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $118 million in 2013 and $106 million in 2012.Operating Income2014 Compared to 2013Operating income increased by $171 million to $1,159 million in 2014 from $988 million in 2013. The $171 million increase in operating income reflected a $79 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, and $26 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $21 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expense, and a $10 million increase in general, administrative, and other expense. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2013 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $26 million (12 percent) increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $23 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses, $9 million in higher branding fees, $4 million from various programs at Protea Hotels, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million in higher termination fees in 2013. Higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses of $23 million primarily reflects $14 million in net favorable results at several leased properties, $10 million of revenue, net of direct expenses for a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and $7 million of revenue, net of direct expenses for new Protea Hotel leases, partially offset by $6 million attributable to International segment properties that converted to managed or franchised.Depreciation, amortization and other expense increased by $21 million (17 percent) to $148 million in 2014 from $127 million in 2013. The increase reflected the $25 million net impairment charge on the EDITION hotels discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” $5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations, $5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from Protea Hotels, and $3 million in higher depreciation related to a North American Full-Service property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, partially offset by $13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and $5 million of 2013 depreciation for two International properties that converted to managed contracts.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $10 million (2 percent) to $659 million in 2014 from $649 million in 2013. The increase largely reflected $9 million from the addition of Protea Hotels and related transition costs, $7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and $6 million of increased guarantee funding, partially offset by $8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013, and a $5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an International segment property. 27Table of Contents2013 Compared to 2012Operating income increased by $48 million to $988 million in 2013 from $940 million in 2012. The $48 million increase in operating income reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $17 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $67 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses and a $25 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expenses. Approximately $7 million of the net increase in operating income was due to the additional four days of activity in 2013. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2012 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $17 million (8 percent) increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue, partially offset by $6 million of lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses. Lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was due to $7 million in costs related to three International segment leases we terminated, $5 million in lower results at one leased property in London, $7 million in pre-opening expenses for the London and Miami Beach EDITION hotels, and a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company for our leased property in Japan, partially offset by $16 million in net favorable results at several leased properties.Depreciation, amortization, and other expenses increased by $25 million (25 percent) to $127 million in 2013 from $102 million in 2012. The $25 million increase largely reflected $18 million of impairment and accelerated amortization expense for deferred contract acquisition costs primarily for properties that left our system or which had cash flow shortfalls, $5 million in higher depreciation at two leased International properties due to an asset write-off and the impact of renovations, $4 million of higher amortization expense year over year for deferred contract acquisition costs related to our 2012 acquisition of the Gaylord brand and hotel management company, $2 million in higher depreciation for two newly acquired properties, and $2 million in higher depreciation for an International property following a conversion to franchised. These increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs in 2012 for a property that exited our system.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $67 million (12 percent) to $649 million in 2013 from $582 million in 2012. The $67 million increase reflected $32 million in higher other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets, higher costs for hotel development, and higher costs for branding and service initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, $26 million of higher compensation and other overhead expenses including increases in hotel development staffing and bonus compensation, $5 million performance cure payment for an International segment property, and a $4 million increase in legal expenses, primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2012. Gains and Other IncomeWe present our gains and other income for 2014, 2013, and 2012 in the following table: ($ in millions)2014 2013 2012Gains on sales of real estate and other$4 $2 $27Gain on sale of joint venture and other investments— 9 21Income from cost method investments4 — 2Impairment of cost method investments and equity securities— — (8) $8 $11 $422014 Compared to 2013Gains and other income decreased by $3 million (27 percent) to $8 million in 2014 compared to $11 million in 2013. This decrease in gains and other income reflected a gain of $8 million on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company in the 2013 second quarter, partially offset by $4 million in net distribution from cost method investments (not allocated to any of our segments) in 2014. See Footnote No. 14, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for additional information on the 2013 sale.2013 Compared to 2012 Gains and other income decreased by $31 million (74 percent) to $11 million in 2013 compared to $42 million in 2012. This decrease in gains and other income principally reflected an unfavorable variance from the $41 million gain we recognized in 2012 on the sale of the equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture, and a $2 million impairment loss 28Table of Contentswe recognized in 2013 as a result of measuring certain assets at fair value less the costs we incurred to sell those assets. See Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information on the reclassification of these assets to held for sale. The decrease in gains and other income was partially offset by a gain of $8 million we recognized in 2013 on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company and a favorable variance from an other-than-temporary $7 million impairment we recorded in 2012. Interest Expense2014 Compared to 2013Interest expense decreased by $5 million (4 percent) to $115 million in 2014 compared to $120 million in 2013. This decrease was principally from $8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a true-up, $2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation, $2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our Marriott Rewards program, and a $2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of EDITION hotels in Miami Beach and New York, offset by completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter. This was partially offset by a net $8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings. 2013 Compared to 2012Interest expense decreased by $17 million (12 percent) to $120 million in 2013 compared to $137 million in 2012. This decrease in interest expense principally reflected a net $13 million decrease due to net Senior Note retirements and new Senior Note issuances at lower interest rates; and $3 million of increased capitalized interest primarily related to developing two EDITION hotels, partially offset by completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter.Interest Income 2014 Compared to 2013Interest income increased by $7 million (30 percent) to $30 million in 2014 compared to $23 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to $6 million earned on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an International property in the 2014 second quarter, and $2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter. See Footnote No. 13, “Notes Receivable” for more information on the mezzanine loan.2013 Compared to 2012Interest income increased by $6 million (35 percent) to $23 million in 2013 compared to $17 million in 2012, primarily reflecting $5 million earned on the $65 million mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest we acquired in the 2013 second quarter. See Footnote No. 14, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for more information on the acquisition.Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2014 Compared to 2013Equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014 improved by $11 million from equity in losses of $5 million in 2013. The increase was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our International joint ventures operate, $9 million in higher earnings from three of our International and one of our North American Full-Service joint ventures, and a favorable variance from a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment. This was partially offset by an $11 million litigation reserve associated with another corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments).2013 Compared to 2012 Equity in losses of $5 million in 2013 improved by $8 million from equity in losses of $13 million in 2012. The change primarily reflected a favorable variance from the following 2012 items: (1) $8 million in losses at a North American Full-Service segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties; and (2) a $2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from an International segment joint venture. These favorable variances were partially offset by a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate joint venture (not allocated to one of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we did not expect to recover the investment. 29Table of ContentsProvision for Income Tax2014 Compared to 2013 Our tax provision increased by $64 million (24 percent) to $335 million in 2014 from $271 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction, and non-recurring favorable foreign true-ups in 2013. The increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program ($21 million), the release of an international valuation allowance ($7 million), and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue ($5 million).2013 Compared to 2012Our tax provision decreased by $7 million (3 percent) to $271 million in 2013 from $278 million in 2012. The decrease resulted from a lower effective tax rate (30.2 percent in 2013 compared to 32.7 percent in 2012), favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments in 2013, favorable variance from a reserve recorded for an international tax issue in 2012, a favorable state tax adjustment in 2013, and higher income before income taxes in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. with lower tax rates, partially offset by higher income tax expense in the U.S.Net Income2014 Compared to 2013 Net income increased by $127 million to $753 million in 2014 from $626 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.54 per share (27 percent) to $2.54 per share from $2.00 per share in 2013. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” or as shown in the Income Statement, the $127 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees ($79 million), higher base management fees ($51 million), higher incentive management fees ($46 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($26 million), higher equity in earnings ($11 million), higher interest income ($7 million), and lower interest expense ($5 million). These increases were partially offset by higher income taxes ($64 million), higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense ($21 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($10 million) and lower gains and other income ($3 million).2013 Compared to 2012Net income increased by $55 million to $626 million in 2013 from $571 million in 2012, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.28 per share (16 percent) to $2.00 per share from $1.72 per share in 2012. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues,” or as shown in the Income Statement, the $55 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), higher incentive management fees ($24 million), lower interest expense ($17 million), lower equity in losses ($8 million), lower income taxes ($7 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($6 million), and higher interest income ($6 million). These increases were partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million) and lower gains and other income ($31 million).Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA, a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under “Depreciation, amortization, and other,” as well as depreciation included under “Reimbursed costs” in our Income Statements, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. 30Table of ContentsWe also believe that Adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude (1) pre-tax impairment charges of $25 million in 2014 which we recorded in the “Depreciation, amortization, and other” caption of our Income Statements following an evaluation of our EDITION hotels and residences for recovery and determination that our cost estimates exceeded our total fixed sales price, and (2) share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. We excluded share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA that excludes these items is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and in particular Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.We show our 2014 and 2013 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile those measures with Net Income in the following table: ($ in millions)2014 2013Net Income$753 $626Interest expense115 120Tax provision335 271Depreciation and amortization123 127Depreciation classified in Reimbursed costs51 48Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures3 4Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures10 13EBITDA$1,390 $1,209EDITION impairment charge25 —Share-based compensation (including share-based compensation reimbursed by third-party owners)109 116Adjusted EBITDA$1,524 $1,325 31Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENTSDuring the 2014 first quarter, we modified the information that our President and Chief Executive Officer reviews to be consistent with our continent structure. This structure aligns our business around geographic regions and is designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to accelerate our worldwide growth. As a result of modifying our reporting information, we revised our operating segments to eliminate our former Luxury segment, which we allocated between our existing North American Full-Service operating segment, and the following four new operating segments: Asia Pacific, Caribbean and Latin America, Europe, and Middle East and Africa. Although our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments meet the applicable accounting criteria to be reportable business segments, the four new operating segments do not meet the criteria to be reportable and we therefore combined them into an “all other” category, which we refer to as “International.” We have revised our business segment information for earlier periods. See Footnote No. 16, “Business Segments,” to our Financial Statements for further information on our segment changes and other information about each segment, including revenues and a reconciliation of segment results to net income. 32Table of ContentsProperties by Segment At year-end 2014, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties by segment: Properties Rooms U.S. Non-U.S. Total U.S. Non-U.S. TotalNorth American Full-Service Segment (1) Marriott Hotels 314 15 329 124,686 5,355 130,041Marriott Conference Centers10 — 10 2,915 — 2,915JW Marriott23 1 24 12,974 221 13,195Renaissance Hotels76 3 79 27,239 1,003 28,242Renaissance ClubSport2 — 2 349 — 349Gaylord Hotels5 — 5 8,098 — 8,098Autograph Collection Hotels44 1 45 10,082 233 10,315The Ritz-Carlton39 1 40 11,424 267 11,691The Ritz-Carlton Residences (2)30 2 32 3,598 214 3,812EDITION1 — 1 295 — 295EDITION Residences (2)1 — 1 25 — 25 545 23 568 201,685 7,293 208,978North American Limited-Service Segment (1) Courtyard861 23 884 120,894 4,096 124,990Fairfield Inn & Suites704 14 718 64,362 1,607 65,969SpringHill Suites314 2 316 36,968 299 37,267AC Hotels by Marriott (3)1 — 1 220 — 220Residence Inn648 20 668 78,518 2,928 81,446TownePlace Suites240 4 244 23,973 518 24,491 2,768 63 2,831 324,935 9,448 334,383International Segment (1) Marriott Hotels— 170 170 — 49,180 49,180JW Marriott— 45 45 — 16,672 16,672Renaissance Hotels— 78 78 — 24,365 24,365Autograph Collection Hotels (3)— 30 30 — 7,195 7,195Protea Hotels— 112 112 — 10,107 10,107Courtyard— 104 104 — 20,810 20,810Fairfield Inn & Suites— 3 3 — 482 482Residence Inn— 7 7 — 717 717AC Hotels by Marriott (3)— 76 76 — 9,311 9,311Moxy Hotels— 1 1 — 162 162Marriott Executive Apartments— 27 27 — 4,261 4,261The Ritz-Carlton— 47 47 — 13,823 13,823Bulgari Hotels & Resorts— 3 3 — 202 202Bulgari Residences (2)— 1 1 — 5 5EDITION— 2 2 — 251 251The Ritz-Carlton Residences (2)— 8 8 — 416 416The Ritz-Carlton Serviced Apartments— 4 4 — 579 579 — 718 718 — 158,538 158,538 Timeshare (4)45 13 58 10,605 2,261 12,866 Total3,358 817 4,175 537,225 177,540 714,765 (1) North American includes properties located in the United States and Canada.

We consider total segment revenues and total segment profits (as defined in Footnote No. 16, “Business Segments”) to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors.2014 Compared to 2013We added 311 properties (46,050 rooms) and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) exited our system in 2014. These figures do not include residential units. During 2014, we also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties or units exited the system. Total segment revenues increased by $1,022 million to $13,540 million in 2014, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $12,518 million in 2013, and total segment profits increased by $196 million to $1,393 million in 2014 from $1,197 million in 2013.The year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $1,022 million was a result of a $787 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $58 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, a $51 million increase in base management fees, and a $46 million increase in incentive management fees. The year-over-year increase of $196 million in segment profits reflected an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, $19 million of lower joint venture equity losses, a $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by a $16 million increase in general, administrative and other expense. For more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2014, 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 38 percent in 2013. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2014 represented 36 percent of properties in North America and 73 percent outside of North America, compared to 21 percent in North America and 70 percent outside of North America in 2013. In addition, in 2014, 56 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of North America versus 58 percent in 2013. Further, we earned $24 million in incentive management fees in 2014 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2013.Compared to 2013, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2014 increased by 120 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 9.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 150 basis points compared to 2013. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 11.4 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 6.6 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity. Note that 2014 had three fewer days of activity when compared to 2013. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.2013 Compared to 2012We added 161 properties (25,420 rooms) and 51 properties (10,299 rooms) exited our system in 2013. These figures do not include residential units. During 2013, we also added five residential properties (301 units) and no residential properties or units exited the system. Total segment revenues increased by $992 million to $12,518 million in 2013, a 9 percent increase from revenues of $11,526 million in 2012, and total segment profits increased by $32 million to $1,197 million in 2013 from $1,165 million in 2012.The year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $992 million was a result of a $923 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, and a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue. The year-over-year increase of $32 million in segment profits reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses, partially offset by a $46 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, $44 million of lower gains and other income, and a $9 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses. For more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2013, 38 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 33 percent in 2012. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2013 represented 21 percent of properties in North America and 70 percent 34Table of Contentsoutside of North America, compared to 15 percent in North America and 70 percent outside of North America in 2012. In addition, in 2013, 58 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 65 percent in 2012. Further, we earned $14 million in incentive management fees in 2013 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2012.Compared to 2012, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2013 increased by 90 basis points and HP-PAR increased by 6.2 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and lower energy costs. Note that 2013 had four additional days of activity when compared to 2012. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Development We added 311 properties, totaling 46,050 rooms, across our brands in 2014, and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties left the system. Highlights of the year included: •Converting 32 properties (8,885 rooms), or 19 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands;•Adding approximately 60 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; and•Adding 120 properties (13,928 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands.We have nearly 240,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline as of year-end 2014, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, as well as nearly 30,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. We expect the number of our hotel rooms (gross) to increase approximately 7 percent in 2015.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.StatisticsThe following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, and for our International segment by region.

($ in millions) Annual Change 2014 2013 2012 Change 2014/2013 Change 2013/2012Segment revenues$8,323 $7,978 $7,276 4% 10%Segment profits$524 $490 $442 7% 11%2014 Compared to 2013 In 2014, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 23 properties (5,093 rooms) and no properties (zero rooms) left the system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 6.4% to $132.44, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.5% percentage points to 72.8%, and average daily rates increased by 4.1% to $182.00.The $34 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, was driven by $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher incentive management fees, and $5 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $11 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $8 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Higher base management and franchise fees were due to stronger RevPAR as a result of increased demand and unit growth, partially offset by $7 million from terminated units. The increase in incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels, partially offset by $5 million in deferred fees recognized in 2013.The decrease in depreciation, amortization, and other expense primarily reflected $11 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013, partially offset by $3 million of higher depreciation for a property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and $2 million in higher accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2014.The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of lower termination fees, $6 million of lower branding fees, and $6 million of pre-opening costs, partially offset by $10 million in revenue, net of direct expenses, for a property we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter.The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was primarily due to a $4 million increase in guarantee funding and $3 million of other property expenses.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $7,465 million in 2014, compared to $7,190 million in 2013.2013 Compared to 2012In 2013, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 13 properties (2,977 rooms) and 15 properties (5,473 rooms) left the system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 5.7 percent to $123.89, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.0 percentage points to 71.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.3 percent to $173.37.The $48 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2012, was driven by $39 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $23 million of higher incentive management fees, $10 million of lower joint venture losses and $3 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses and $11 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense. Higher base management and franchise fees stemmed from both higher RevPAR due to increased demand and unit growth, including the Gaylord brand properties we began managing in 2012, a favorable variance from $2 million of fee reversals in 2012 for a property with a contract revision, and also reflected fees for the additional four days of activity. The increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and margins. 40Table of ContentsHigher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was primarily driven by our recognition in 2013 of $7 million in termination fees for five properties, $6 million of stronger earnings at two leased and one owned property, and $5 million of higher branding fees and other revenue, partially offset by our recognition in 2012 of a $14 million termination fee for one property and $2 million in pre-opening expenses for The Miami Beach EDITION in 2013.The increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expense resulted from an $11 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs primarily related to three properties that left the system and one property that converted to a franchised property, $5 million of higher amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the Gaylord brand and hotel management company and depreciation from the acquisition of a property, partially offset by a favorable variance from the 2012 accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that exited our system and for which we earned the $14 million termination fee mentioned in the preceding paragraph.General, administrative, and other expenses reflected an unfavorable variance from $9 million in other net miscellaneous cost increases and $8 million in reversals of guarantee accruals in 2012 for three properties.The decrease in joint venture equity losses reflected a favorable variance from $8 million in losses in 2012 at a North American Full-Service segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $7,190 million in 2013, compared to $6,563 million in 2012.North American Limited-Service includes AC Hotels by Marriott, Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, and TownePlace Suites located in the United States and Canada.

The majority of the properties that left the system were Fairfield Inn & Suites and Residence Inn properties. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 7.5 percent to $89.11, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.3 percentage points to 74.0 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.2 percent to $120.36.The $95 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, primarily reflected $80 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $7 million of higher incentive management fees. Higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher RevPAR for comparable properties and unit growth, and included $15 million of higher deferred management fees and $10 million of higher relicensing fees. Increased incentive management fees resulted from net house profit growth at managed hotels.The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflected $5 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties and $4 million of higher termination fees.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $2,217 million in 2014, compared to $1,939 million in 2013.2013 Compared to 2012In 2013, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 108 properties (12,927 rooms) and 22 properties (2,427 rooms) left the system. The majority of the properties that left the system were Courtyard and Fairfield Inn & Suites properties. In the 2012 second quarter, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay corporate housing business. The revenues, 41Table of Contentsresults of operations, assets, and liabilities of our ExecuStay business were not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 4.4 percent to $82.52, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.7 percentage points to 71.8 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.4 percent to $115.00.The $7 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2012, primarily reflected $45 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $4 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $43 million of lower gains and other income. Higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher RevPAR due to increased demand, some of which was attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations, and higher relicensing fees, as well as the additional four days of activity, partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of $7 million of deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture. The increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins. Lower gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a $41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture in 2012. See the “Gains and Other Income” caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,939 million in 2013, compared to $1,832 million in 2012.International includes properties, regardless of brand, that are located outside the United States and Canada.

See “Business and Overview” for a discussion of results in the various International segment regions.The $67 million increase in segment profits in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily consisted of $22 million in higher incentive management fees, $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher equity in earnings, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $6 million higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher RevPAR, partially offset by the impact of $3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $4 million from terminated units. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates.The increase of equity in earnings was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our International joint ventures operate and $7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures.The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $10 million from Protea Hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter, $5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated, $5 million of pre-opening costs in 2013, $4 million from new units, and $4 million of favorable operating profits, partially offset by an unfavorable variance of $12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013, and $6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised. 42Table of ContentsThe increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was primarily due to $5 million related to the Protea Hotels acquisition and $5 million in higher compensation, partially offset by a $5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International segment properties totaled $1,305 million in 2014, compared to $1,071 million in 2013.2013 Compared to 2012In 2013, across our International segment we added 45 properties (9,817 rooms) and 11 properties (2,199 rooms) left the system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 3.4 percent to $126.72, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.3 percentage points to 70.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.4 percent to $179.28. The $23 million decrease in segment profits in 2013, compared to 2012, predominantly reflected $17 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $9 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense, $5 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $3 million of lower incentive management fees, and $3 million of increased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher base management and franchise fees.The increase in base management and franchise fees largely reflected new unit growth and higher RevPAR due to increased demand. The decrease in incentive management fees was primarily driven by a $3 million unfavorable impact from a contract revision for a property, a $2 million unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with a property's change in ownership, and a $3 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact. These were partially offset by higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins and net new unit growth.The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $7 million in costs related to three International segment leases we terminated, $5 million in weaker earnings at one leased property in London, and $5 million of pre-opening expenses for The London EDITION, partially offset by $12 million of higher termination fees principally associated with three properties. Higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense resulted primarily from $4 million of assets written off at two properties and $3 million due to new unit growth and renovations at two properties. The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected $14 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, $7 million of higher accounts receivable reserves primarily related to two properties, and a $5 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by a favorable variance from a $5 million guarantee accrual for one property in 2012. Higher joint venture equity losses were primarily driven by a renovation at a hotel in one joint venture and lower earnings at two other joint ventures. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International segment properties totaled $1,071 million in 2013, compared to $882 million in 2012.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. During 2014, we granted 1.9 million RSUs, 0.3 million service and performance RSUs, 0.3 million Employee SARs, and 0.1 million stock options. See Footnote No. 5, “Share-Based Compensation,” for more information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote No. 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Financial Statements for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. 43Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOn July 18, 2013, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to extend the facility's expiration to July 18, 2018 and increase the facility size to $2,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings. The material terms of the amended and restated Credit Facility otherwise did not change. The facility supports general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate), plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For more information on our Credit Facility, see Exhibit 10, “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on July 19, 2013.The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels, or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, will remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill our other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2014, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1,032 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $928 million under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $104 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $2,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $1,072 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility). We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from Operations Cash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2014 2013 2012Cash from operations$1,224 $1,140 $989Non-cash items (1)328 316 420(1) Includes depreciation, amortization, impairments, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes. 44Table of ContentsOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.6 to 1.0 at year-end 2014 and 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2013. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in Exhibit 12 to this 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows: Fiscal Years2014 2013 2012 2011 20106.2x 5.1x 4.6x 2.3x 2.9xSpin-off Cash Tax BenefitsTax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013, and we expect that the spin-off will result in our realization through 2015 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. We realized $447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately $33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015. Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $411 million in 2014, $296 million in 2013, and $437 million in 2012. These included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2014 increased by $115 million compared to 2013, primarily related to developing two EDITION hotels and our 2014 acquisition of a property in our International Segment, partially offset by the completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter (see Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information). Capital expenditures in 2013 decreased by $141 million compared to 2012, primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of land and a building that we used to develop an EDITION hotel. We expect 2015 investment spending will total approximately $600 million to $800 million, including approximately $125 million for maintenance capital spending and approximately $135 million (C$168 million) for the expected acquisition of Delta Hotels. Investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions, construction, and renovations), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments.Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $435 million cash proceeds in 2014 and $65 million in 2012. See Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan advances, net of loan collections, amounted to $69 million in 2014 compared to net collections of $70 million in 2013. At year-end 2014, we had a $3 million senior loan and $239 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $24 million current) outstanding, compared with a $3 million senior loan and $175 million of mezzanine and other loans ($142 million noncurrent and $36 million current) outstanding at year-end 2013. In 2014, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $64 million, primarily reflecting the issuance of the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) described in Footnote No. 13, “Notes Receivable,” partially offset by $31 million of collections on MVW notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our Timeshare spin-off. 45Table of ContentsEquity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $6 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013, and $15 million in 2012 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt increased by $582 million in 2014, to $3,781 million at year-end 2014 from $3,199 million at year-end 2013, and reflected our 2014 fourth quarter issuance of $394 million (book value) of Series N Notes and a $238 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by a $53 million reduction in other debt. Debt increased by $264 million in 2013, to $3,199 million at year-end 2013 from $2,935 million at year-end 2012, and reflected our 2013 third quarter issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series M Notes and a $333 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by the $400 million (book value) retirement, at maturity, of our Series J Notes, $15 million in decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility, and a $2 million reduction in other debt. See Footnote No. 10, “Long-Term Debt” for additional information on the debt issuances. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2014, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 3.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2014.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases. We purchased 24.2 million shares of our common stock in 2014 at an average price of $62.09 per share, 20.0 million shares in 2013 at an average price of $41.46 per share, and 31.2 million shares in 2012 at an average price of $37.15 per share. At year-end 2014, 15.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. On February 12, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors increased, by 25 million shares, the authorization to repurchase our common stock. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared and paid the following quarterly cash dividends in 2014: (1) $0.17 per share declared February 14 and paid March 28 to shareholders of record as of February 28; (2) $0.20 per share declared May 9 and paid June 27 to shareholders of record as of May 23; (3) $0.20 per share declared August 7 and paid September 26 to shareholders of record as of August 21; and (4) $0.20 per share declared November 7 and paid December 26 to shareholders of record on November 20. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share on February 12, 2015, payable on March 27, 2015 to shareholders of record on February 27, 2015.Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at year-end 2014: Payments Due by Period($ in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsDebt (1)$4,248 $442 $755 $1,796 $1,255Capital lease obligations (1)8 1 2 2 3Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse844 115 206 157 366Nonrecourse233 14 29 28 162Operating leases where we are secondarily liable2 2 — — —Purchase obligations 186 66 80 40 —Other noncurrent liabilities43 1 3 2 37Total contractual obligations$5,564 $641 $1,075 $2,025 $1,823 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2014 of $10 million.

Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.Guarantee Commitments The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments at year-end 2014: Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal guarantees where we are the primary obligor$149 $5 $24 $90 $30Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable127 26 49 39 13Total guarantee commitments$276 $31 $73 $129 $43In conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner.Investment Commitments We also had the following investment commitments outstanding at year-end 2014: Amount of Investment Commitments ExpectedFunding by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsTotal investment commitments$68 $61 $7 $— $—For further information on our investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments” caption in Footnote No. 7, “Commitments and Contingencies.”Letters of CreditAt year-end 2014, we also had $87 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the Credit Facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2014 totaled $153 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. We also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. Undistributed earnings attributable to our equity method investments represented approximately $3 million of our consolidated retained earnings at year-end 2014. For other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 17, “Related Party Transactions.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available at the time the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our 47Table of Contentsassumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.See Footnote No. 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Rewards Programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;Loan Loss Reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; andIncome Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2014, our investments had a fair value of $121 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

All fiscal years presented before 2013 included 52 weeks, except for 2008 which included 53 weeks.(2) Balances do not reflect the impact of discontinued operations. Also, for periods prior to 2009, we reclassified our provision for loan losses associated with our lodging operations to the “General, administrative, and other” caption of our Income Statements to conform to our presentation for periods beginning in 2009. This reclassification only affected operating income.(3) We adopted certain provisions of Accounting Standards Certification Topic 978 (previously Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions”), in 2006, which we reported in our Income Statements as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.(4) The following businesses became discontinued operations in the year we announced that we would sell or exit them: synthetic fuel (2007).(5) We issued stock dividends in the third and fourth quarters of 2009, and a stock split in the form of a stock dividend on June 9, 2006. We have adjusted all per share data retroactively to reflect those stock dividends. (6) Represents fee revenue from the United States (but not Hawaii before 2011) and Canada.(7) Represents fee revenue outside of North America, as defined in footnote (6) above.(8) Effective year-end 2014, we adopted ASU No. 2015-03, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs, and ASU No. 2015-17, which changes the classification of deferred taxes. Prior periods have not been adjusted for these new accounting standards. 23Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverview We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 87 countries and territories under 19 brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We group our operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International.We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. 24Table of ContentsPending Combination with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.On November 15, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to combine with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”). The Merger Agreement provides for the Company to combine with Starwood in a series of transactions after which Starwood will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Starwood Combination”). If these transactions are completed, shareholders of Starwood will receive 0.920 shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and $2.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Starwood common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that they own immediately before these transactions. We expect that the combination will close in mid-2016, after customary conditions are satisfied, including shareholder approvals, required antitrust approvals, and the completion of Starwood’s previously announced spin-off of its vacation ownership business, or another spin-off, split-off, analogous disposition, or sale of its vacation ownership business.Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.References to year-end 2015 RevPAR statistics throughout this report, including occupancy and ADR, reflect the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2014 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated: (1) 86% of North American properties (87% excluding Delta Hotels and Resorts) in 2015, 87% in 2014, and 89% in 2013; (2) 57% of International properties (68% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2015, 57% (71% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, and 75% in 2013; and (3) 82% of total properties (85% excluding Protea Hotels and Delta Hotels and Resorts) in 2015, 82% of total properties (85% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, and 87% in 2013.We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Business TrendsOur 2015 results reflected a favorable economic climate and demand for our brands in many markets around the world, reflecting generally low supply growth in the U.S. and Europe, moderate GDP growth in North America, improved pricing in most North American markets, and a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2015 increased 5.2 percent to $112.25, average daily rates increased 4.1 percent on a constant dollar basis to $152.30, and occupancy increased 0.8 percentage points to 73.7 percent, compared to 2014. Generally strong U.S. group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2015, allowing us to eliminate discounts, shift business into higher rated price categories, and raise room rates. The growth was partially constrained by new select-service lodging supply and moderating GDP growth late in the year. In 2015, bookings for future group business in the U.S. improved. New group business booked in 2015 for any period in the future increased 9 percent year over year. The 2016 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels (Marriott, JW Marriott, Renaissance, The Ritz-Carlton, and Gaylord brands) in North America was up more than 6 percent as of year-end 2015, compared to the 2015 group booking pace measured as of year-end 2014. In North America, RevPAR from transient 25Table of Contentsguests increased 5 percent in 2015 reflecting strong demand from professional services, technology, and defense firms moderated somewhat by weaker demand from manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and energy companies. The Europe region experienced higher demand in 2015 across most countries, primarily due to increased group and transient business driven by special events and the weak currency, partially constrained by weaker demand in France, particularly late in the year. Results improved in Russia due to increased domestic travel. In the Asia Pacific region, demand increased led by growth from corporate and other transient business in Japan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The growth was partially offset by weaker results in South Korea. RevPAR in Greater China moderated in 2015 due to the impact of supply growth in certain Southern China markets, continued austerity in Beijing, and lower inbound travel to Hong Kong, while demand in Shanghai remained strong. Middle East demand was weaker in 2015, reflecting the region’s instability and lower oil prices, partially offset by strong government and group demand in Saudi Arabia. Demand in the United Arab Emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in travelers from Russia. In Africa, results were favorable in 2015. In the Caribbean and Latin America, strong performance in the region in 2015 was driven by greater demand in Mexico and increased leisure travel to our Caribbean and Mexican resorts for most of the year, constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in Panama and weaker economies in Brazil and Puerto Rico. We monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. Our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2015, which allowed our hotels to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited ADR. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2015, 2014, and 2013.Revenues2015 Compared to 2014 ($ in millions)December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Increase (decrease) from prior year Percentage change from prior yearBase management fees $698 $672 $26 4 %Franchise fees853 745 108 14 %Incentive management fees 319 302 17 6 % 1,870 1,719 151 9 %Owned, leased, and other revenue 986 1,022 (36) (4)%Cost reimbursements 11,630 11,055 575 5 % $14,486 $13,796 $690 5 % The $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger RevPAR ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million).The $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher RevPAR and house profit margins primarily at company-managed North American properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. Higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the Delta Hotels and Resorts acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation. The $36 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue reflected $44 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we 26Table of Contentsacquired as part of our acquisition of Protea Hotels in the 2014 second quarter. Lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from Protea Hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from The Miami Beach EDITION hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions.”Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our rewards programs, reservations, and marketing programs. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. Since the end of 2014, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system.2014 Compared to 2013($ in millions)December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Increase from prior year Percentage change from prior yearBase management fees $672 $621 $51 8%Franchise fees745 666 79 12%Incentive management fees 302 256 46 18% 1,719 1,543 176 11%Owned, leased, and other revenue 1,022 950 72 8%Cost reimbursements 11,055 10,291 764 7% $13,796 $12,784 $1,012 8%The $51 million increase in total base management fees, largely reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across our system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million). The $79 million increase in total franchise fees, reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across our system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million). The $46 million increase in incentive management fees largely reflected higher net house profit at our North American and International managed hotels in addition to unit growth in International markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher North American Full-Service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million). We estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million.The $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various Protea Hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. Higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from Protea Hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased International properties, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five International properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013.The $764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across our system. 27Table of ContentsOperating Income2015 Compared to 2014Operating income increased by $191 million to $1,350 million in 2015 from $1,159 million in 2014. The $191 million increase in operating income reflected a $108 million increase in franchise fees, a $26 million increase in base management fees, a $25 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, a $17 million increase in incentive management fees, a $9 million decrease in depreciation, amortization, and other expense, and $6 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2014 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $6 million (2 percent) increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $4 million in higher branding fees. Owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was unchanged as stronger results at several of our International properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, were offset by $10 million of weaker performance due to renovations.Depreciation, amortization and other expense decreased by $9 million (6 percent) to $139 million in 2015 from $148 million in 2014. The decrease reflected a $25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the EDITION hotels, partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of $6 million for The Miami Beach EDITION residences and $6 million for The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION, which are both discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” and a $4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $25 million (4 percent) to $634 million in 2015 from $659 million in 2014. The decrease largely reflected a $28 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with litigation resolutions, $24 million of development costs that we deferred in 2015 related to our growing franchise pipeline, and $5 million in lower foreign exchange losses compared to the 2014 devaluation of assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars, partially offset by $20 million of higher costs incurred to grow our brands globally, $5 million of transaction costs related to the Starwood Combination, and $5 million from the Delta Hotels and Resorts acquisition.2014 Compared to 2013Operating income increased by $171 million to $1,159 million in 2014 from $988 million in 2013. The $171 million increase in operating income reflected a $79 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, and $26 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $21 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expense, and a $10 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. We discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2013 in the preceding “Revenues” section.The $26 million (12 percent) increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $23 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses, $9 million in higher branding fees, $4 million from various programs at Protea Hotels, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million in higher termination fees in 2013. Higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses of $23 million primarily reflects $14 million in net favorable results at several leased properties, $10 million of revenue, net of direct expenses for a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and $7 million of revenue, net of direct expenses for new Protea Hotel leases, partially offset by $6 million attributable to International properties that converted to managed or franchised.Depreciation, amortization and other expense increased by $21 million (17 percent) to $148 million in 2014 from $127 million in 2013. The increase reflected the $25 million net impairment charge on the EDITION hotels discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” $5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations, $5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from Protea Hotels, and $3 million in higher depreciation related to a North American Full-Service property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, partially offset by $13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and $5 million of 2013 depreciation for two International properties that converted to managed contracts.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $10 million (2 percent) to $659 million in 2014 from $649 million in 2013. The increase largely reflected $9 million from the addition of Protea Hotels and related transition costs, $7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the devaluation of assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars, and $6 million of increased guarantee funding, partially offset by $8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013, and a $5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an International property. 28Table of ContentsGains and Other Income, Net2015 Compared to 2014Gains and other income, net increased by $19 million (238 percent) to $27 million in 2015 compared to $8 million in 2014. The increase primarily reflects the $41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest, discussed in Footnote No. 14, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” The increase was partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an International property and a $4 million expected disposal loss for a North American Limited-Service segment plot of land, both discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions.” 2014 Compared to 2013Gains and other income, net decreased by $3 million (27 percent) to $8 million in 2014 compared to $11 million in 2013. This decrease in gains and other income, net reflected a gain of $8 million on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company in the 2013 second quarter, partially offset by $4 million in net distribution from cost method investments (not allocated to any of our segments) in 2014.Interest Expense 2015 Compared to 2014Interest expense increased by $52 million (45 percent) to $167 million in 2015 compared to $115 million in 2014. The increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of The Miami Beach EDITION in the 2014 fourth quarter and The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION in the 2015 second quarter ($25 million), interest on the Series O Notes and Series P Notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the Series N Notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter ($17 million), and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion true-up ($7 million).2014 Compared to 2013Interest expense decreased by $5 million (4 percent) to $115 million in 2014 compared to $120 million in 2013. This decrease was principally from $8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a true-up, $2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation, $2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our Marriott Rewards program, and a $2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of EDITION hotels in Miami Beach and New York, offset by completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter. This was partially offset by a net $8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings. Interest Income 2015 Compared to 2014Interest income decreased by $1 million (3 percent) to $29 million in 2015 compared to $30 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter ($5 million), partially offset by higher interest income on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an International property in the 2014 second quarter ($5 million). 2014 Compared to 2013Interest income increased by $7 million (30 percent) to $30 million in 2014 compared to $23 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to $6 million earned on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an International property in the 2014 second quarter, and $2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter. See Footnote No. 13, “Notes Receivable” for more information on the mezzanine loan.Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2015 Compared to 2014Equity in earnings of $16 million in 2015 increased by $10 million from equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014. The increase reflects a $22 million year-over-year impact from the reversal in 2015 of an $11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an International investee’s liabilities. The increase was partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge relating to an 29Table of ContentsInternational joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our International investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate. 2014 Compared to 2013Equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014 improved by $11 million from equity in losses of $5 million in 2013. The increase was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our International joint ventures operate, $9 million in higher earnings from three of our International and one of our North American Full-Service joint ventures, and a favorable variance from a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment. This was partially offset by an $11 million litigation reserve associated with another equity investment discussed above (not allocated to any of our segments).Provision for Income Tax 2015 Compared to 2014 Our tax provision increased by $61 million (18 percent) to $396 million in 2015 from $335 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a U.S. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program, the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance, and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue. The increase was partially offset by a favorable IRS settlement relating to share-based compensation ($12 million), a tax benefit from an International property disposition ($7 million), and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction ($5 million).2014 Compared to 2013Our tax provision increased by $64 million (24 percent) to $335 million in 2014 from $271 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction, and non-recurring favorable foreign true-ups in 2013. The increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program ($21 million), the release of an international valuation allowance ($7 million), and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue ($5 million).Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude (1) the pre-tax EDITION impairment charges of $12 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014, which we recorded in the “Depreciation, amortization, and other” caption of our Income Statements following an evaluation of our EDITION hotels and residences for recovery; (2) the $15 million pre-tax loss on dispositions of real estate, which we recorded in the “Gains and other income, net” caption of our Income Statements in 2015; (3) the $41 million pre-tax gain triggered by a mandatory redemption feature of a preferred equity investment in 2015; and (4) share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies, and because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the lodging industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings, and accordingly interest expense’s impact on earnings varies significantly among companies. Similarly, tax positions will vary among companies as a result of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under “Depreciation, amortization, and other,” as well as depreciation included under “Reimbursed costs” in our Income Statements, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We also exclude share-based compensation expense to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, 30Table of Contentsother companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.We present our 2015 and 2014 Adjusted EBITDA calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile this measure with Net Income in the following table:($ in millions)2015 2014Net Income$859 $753Interest expense167 115Tax provision396 335Depreciation and amortization127 123Depreciation classified in Reimbursed costs58 51Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures2 3Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures10 10EBITDA$1,619 $1,390EDITION impairment charge12 25Loss on dispositions of real estate15 —Gain on redemption of preferred equity ownership interest(41) —Share-based compensation (including share-based compensation reimbursed by third-party owners)113 109Adjusted EBITDA$1,718 $1,524BUSINESS SEGMENTSWe are a diversified global lodging company with operations in three reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International.

MVW reports its property and room counts on a fiscal year basis for the MVW fiscal year ended January 1, 2016. 32Table of ContentsThe following discussion reflects all three of our reportable segments. We consider total segment revenues and total segment profits (as defined in Footnote No. 16, “Business Segments”) to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors.2015 Compared to 2014We added 300 properties (51,547 rooms) and 51 properties (6,328 rooms) exited our system in 2015. Total segment revenues increased by $678 million to $14,218 million in 2015, a five percent increase from revenues of $13,540 million in 2014, and total segment profits increased by $111 million to $1,504 million in 2015, an eight percent increase from $1,393 million in 2014.The year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $678 million was a result of a $572 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $109 million increase in franchise fees, a $26 million increase in base management fees, and a $17 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $46 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue. The year-over-year increase of $111 million in segment profits reflected a $109 million increase in franchise fees, a $26 million increase in base management fees, and a $17 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in gains and other income, net, a $12 million decrease in equity in earnings, a $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses. For more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2015, 68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 represented 63 percent of properties in North America and 74 percent outside of North America, compared to 36 percent in North America and 73 percent outside of North America in 2014. The percentage of North American properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 due to a few large North American Limited-Service portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014. In addition, in 2015, 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of North America versus 56 percent in 2014. Compared to 2014, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2015 increased by 80 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 7.5 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 80 basis points compared to 2014. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 7.8 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 6.9 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.2014 Compared to 2013We added 311 properties (46,050 rooms) and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) exited our system in 2014. These figures do not include residential units. During 2014, we also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties or units exited our system. Total segment revenues increased by $1,022 million to $13,540 million in 2014, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $12,518 million in 2013, and total segment profits increased by $196 million to $1,393 million in 2014 from $1,197 million in 2013.The year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $1,022 million was a result of a $787 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $58 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, a $51 million increase in base management fees, and a $46 million increase in incentive management fees. The year-over-year increase of $196 million in segment profits reflected an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, $19 million of lower joint venture equity losses, a $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by a $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. For more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with “Revenues.”In 2014, 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 38 percent in 2013. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2014 represented 36 percent of properties in North America and 73 percent 33Table of Contentsoutside of North America, compared to 21 percent in North America and 70 percent outside of North America in 2013. In addition, in 2014, 56 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of North America versus 58 percent in 2013. Further, we earned $24 million in incentive management fees in 2014 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2013.Compared to 2013, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2014 increased by 120 basis points and HP-PAR increased by 9.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. These same factors contributed to North American company-operated house profit margins increasing by 150 basis points compared to 2013. HP-PAR at those same properties increased by 11.4 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 6.6 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and improved productivity. Note that 2014 had three fewer days of activity when compared to 2013. See “Statistics” below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company-operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Development In 2015, we added 300 properties with 51,547 rooms across our brands, including 9,590 rooms from the acquisition of Delta Hotels and Resorts, and 51 properties (6,328 rooms) left our system. No residential properties entered or left our system. Highlights of the year included: •Converting 39 properties (7,301 rooms), or 14 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands;•Adding approximately 32 percent of all the new rooms outside North America; and•Adding 173 properties (19,712 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands.We have over 270,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline as of year-end 2015, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, as well as nearly 27,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. We expect the number of our open hotel rooms (gross) to increase approximately 8 percent in 2016. This development pipeline and expected hotel room growth information does not include rooms that will join our system through the Starwood Combination.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, and for our International properties by region.

Base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger RevPAR driven by rate and unit growth, partially offset by $5 million of contract modifications and terminations. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels. 38Table of ContentsLower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $8 million of weaker performance at a North American Full-Service property under renovation.General, administrative, and other expenses were higher due to $5 million from the Delta Hotels and Resorts acquisition and $2 million in higher reserves for guarantee funding, partially offset by $3 million of other property expenses incurred in 2014.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $7,911 million in 2015, compared to $7,465 million in 2014.2014 Compared to 2013In 2014, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 23 properties (5,093 rooms) and no properties (zero rooms) left our system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 6.4 percent to $132.44, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.5 percentage points to 72.8 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.1 percent to $182.00.The $34 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, was driven by $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher incentive management fees, and $5 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $11 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $8 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.Base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger RevPAR as a result of increased demand and unit growth, partially offset by $7 million from terminated units. The increase in incentive management fees was primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels, partially offset by $5 million in deferred fees recognized in 2013.The decrease in depreciation, amortization, and other expense primarily reflected $11 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013, partially offset by $3 million of higher depreciation for a property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and $2 million in higher accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2014.The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of lower termination fees, $6 million of lower branding fees, and $6 million of pre-opening costs, partially offset by $10 million in revenue, net of direct expenses, for a property we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter.General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to a $4 million increase in guarantee funding and $3 million of other property expenses.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $7,465 million in 2014, compared to $7,190 million in 2013.North American Limited-Service includes AC Hotels by Marriott, Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, and TownePlace Suites located in the United States and Canada.($ in millions) Annual Change 2015 2014 2013 Change 2015/2014 Change 2014/2013Segment revenues$3,193 $2,962 $2,583 8% 15%Segment profits$651 $574 $479 13% 20%2015 Compared to 2014 In 2015, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 173 properties (19,712 rooms) and 26 properties (2,820 rooms) left our system. The majority of the properties that left our system were Fairfield Inn & Suites and Residence Inn properties. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 5.6 percent to $94.99, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.5 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.9 percent to $127.65.The $77 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, reflected $73 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $13 million of higher incentive management fees, $2 million of lower general, administrative, and other 39Table of Contentsexpenses, and $1 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $5 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of lower equity in earnings.Base management and franchise fees were higher due to unit growth and stronger room rates, including $19 million of higher franchise licensing and application fees, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in previously deferred fees and $3 million of contract terminations. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees.Lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $3 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties.Gains and other income, net were lower due to a $4 million expected disposal loss on a plot of land. See Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Lower equity in earnings was driven by the redemption of our investment in an entity that owns two hotels.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $2,366 million in 2015, compared to $2,217 million in 2014.2014 Compared to 2013In 2014, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 120 properties (13,928 rooms) and 32 properties (3,030 rooms) left our system. The majority of the properties that left our system were Fairfield Inn & Suites and Residence Inn properties. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 7.5 percent to $89.11, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.3 percentage points to 74.0 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.2 percent to $120.36.The $95 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, primarily reflected $80 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $7 million of higher incentive management fees. Higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher RevPAR for comparable properties and unit growth, and included $15 million of higher deferred management fees and $10 million of higher relicensing fees. Increased incentive management fees resulted from net house profit growth at managed hotels.The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflected $5 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties and $4 million of higher termination fees.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $2,217 million in 2014, compared to $1,939 million in 2013.International includes properties, regardless of brand, that are located outside the United States and Canada.($ in millions) Annual Change 2015 2014 2013 Change 2015/2014 Change 2014/2013Segment revenues$2,200 $2,255 $1,957 (2)% 15%Segment profits$292 $295 $228 (1)% 29%2015 Compared to 2014 In 2015, across our International regions we added 70 properties (16,490 rooms) and 20 properties (2,110 rooms) left our system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 5.1 percent to $124.13, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.1 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.1 percent to $171.20. See “Business and Overview” for a discussion of trends in the various International regions. 40Table of ContentsThe $3 million decrease in segment profits in 2015, compared to 2014, consisted of $12 million of lower gains and other income, net, $9 million of lower equity in earnings, $6 million of lower incentive management fees, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $18 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense. Base management and franchise fees increased due to stronger RevPAR, driven by both occupancy and rate, and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $16 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Lower incentive management fees reflected $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth. Higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected favorable operating results at several of our properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, and $7 million of increased termination fees, partially offset by $4 million in lower branding fees, and $2 million from a property that converted to managed.Lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense was driven by amortization true-ups and lower depreciation from an International property sold in 2015, partially offset by $5 million of higher depreciation at several of our leased properties.General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher costs for branding and service initiatives to grow our brands globally.Lower gains and other income, net primarily reflected an $11 million loss on the sale of an International property discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions.”Lower equity in earnings reflected an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our International investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate, and a $6 million impairment charge relating to an International joint venture, partially offset by a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an International investee’s liabilities.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International properties totaled $1,282 million in 2015, compared to $1,305 million in 2014.2014 Compared to 2013In 2014, across our International regions we added 170 properties (26,737 rooms) and 16 properties (3,130 rooms) left our system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 5.1 percent to $133.37, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.0 percentage points to 71.9 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.1 percent to $185.39. See “Business and Overview” for a discussion of results in the various International regions.The $67 million increase in segment profits in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily consisted of $22 million in higher incentive management fees, $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher equity in earnings, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $6 million higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher RevPAR, partially offset by the impact of $3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $4 million from terminated units. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates.The increase of equity in earnings was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our International joint ventures operate and $7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures.The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $10 million from Protea Hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter, $5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated, $5 million of pre-opening costs in 2013, $4 million from new units, and $4 million of favorable operating profits, partially offset by an unfavorable variance of $12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013, and $6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised. 41Table of ContentsThe increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was primarily due to $5 million related to the Protea Hotels acquisition and $5 million in higher compensation, partially offset by a $5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International properties totaled $1,305 million in 2014, compared to $1,071 million in 2013.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We also issue performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) to named executive officers and some of their direct reports under the Stock and Cash Incentive Plan. During 2015, we granted 1.3 million RSUs, 0.1 million PSUs, and 0.3 million SARs. See Footnote No. 5, “Share-Based Compensation,” for more information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote No. 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Financial Statements for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOur multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) provides for $2,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. In addition, we may use borrowings under the Credit Facility, or commercial paper supported by the Credit Facility, to finance all or part of the cash component of the consideration to Starwood shareholders in connection with the Starwood Combination and certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the combination. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. The term of the Credit Facility expires on July 18, 2018. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2015, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1,158 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,062 million under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $96 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $2,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $938 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility). We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed 42Table of Contentscredit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from OperationsCash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2015 2014 2013Cash from operations$1,430 $1,224 $1,140Non-cash items (1)395 328 316(1) Includes depreciation, amortization, impairments, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2015 and 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2014. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in Exhibit 12 to this 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows:Fiscal Years2015 2014 2013 2012 20116.4x 6.2x 5.1x 4.6x 2.3xSpin-off Cash Tax BenefitsTax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013. As we expected, the spin-off resulted in our realization through 2015 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. We realized $447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately $33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015. Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $305 million in 2015, $411 million in 2014, and $296 million in 2013. These included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2015 decreased by $106 million compared to 2014, primarily related to the 2014 development of two EDITION hotels, partially offset by 2015 renovations at a North American Full-Service property and investments in our reservations system. Capital expenditures in 2014 increased by $115 million compared to 2013, primarily related to developing two EDITION hotels and our 2014 acquisition of an International property, partially offset by the completion of The London EDITION in the 2013 fourth quarter.We expect 2016 investment spending will total approximately $450 million to $550 million, including approximately $100 million for maintenance capital spending. Investment spending also includes other capital expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, acquisitions, and equity and other investments. See our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for information on investment spending for 2015. Our anticipated investment spending does not include additional investments we may make in connection with the Starwood Combination, which we expect will close in mid-2016, after customary conditions are satisfied, including shareholder approvals, required antitrust approvals, and the completion of Starwood’s previously announced spin-off of its vacation ownership business, or another spin-off, split-off, analogous disposition, or sale of its vacation ownership business. See Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for more information about the Starwood Combination. 43Table of ContentsOver time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $673 million cash proceeds in 2015 and $435 million in 2014. See Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $26 million in 2015 compared to net advances of $69 million in 2014. At year-end 2015, we had a $3 million senior loan (current) and $218 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $3 million current) outstanding, compared with a $3 million senior loan (current) and $239 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $24 million current) outstanding at year-end 2014. In 2015, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $21 million, primarily reflecting $86 million of collections on MVW notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our Timeshare spin-off, partially offset by the issuance of the $58 million mezzanine loan (net of a $6 million discount) described in Footnote No. 13, “Notes Receivable.” Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $7 million in 2015, $6 million in 2014, and $16 million in 2013 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt increased by $336 million in 2015, to $4,107 million at year-end 2015 from $3,771 million at year-end 2014, and reflected $790 million ($800 million face amount) in Series O and P Notes issuances, partially offset by $314 million from the redemption of Series G Notes and a $134 million decrease in commercial paper borrowings. See Footnote No. 10, “Long-Term Debt” for additional information on the debt issuances. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2015, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 2.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2015.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases.

We also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.Other Related PartiesWe provide management services for and receive fees from properties owned by JWM Family Enterprises, L.P., which is beneficially owned and controlled by J.W. Marriott, Jr., Deborah Marriott Harrison, and other members of the Marriott family.For more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 17, “Related Party Transactions.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available at the time the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.See Footnote No. 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Rewards Programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;Loan Loss Reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; andIncome Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt. 46Table of ContentsWe are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year-end 2015, our investments had a fair value of $37 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Footnote No. 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information on derivative instruments.The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2015 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period ($ in millions)2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$2 $2 $19 $1 $2 $39 $65 $65Average interest rate 2.09% Floating-rate notes receivable$4 $1 $41 $4 $— $106 $156 $151Average interest rate 5.73% Liabilities - Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(299) $(301) $(9) $(605) $(357) $(1,593) $(3,164) $(2,943)Average interest rate 3.68% Floating-rate debt$— $— $(938) $— $— $— $(938) $(938)Average interest rate 0.62% 47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:06:17.335770
1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2017,"Item 7. We refer to our business associated with brands that were in our portfolio before the Starwood Combination as “Legacy-Marriott” and to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.” See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Company-Operated PropertiesAt year-end 2016, we operated 1,821 properties (521,552 rooms) under long-term management agreements with property owners, 48 properties (10,933 rooms) under long-term lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”), and 22 properties (9,906 rooms) that we own. In addition, we operated 2Table of Contentsunder long-term management agreements 44 home and condominium communities (5,179 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations.Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount. Many of our Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. A large number of our Operating Agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies. In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.For lodging facilities that we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees who are needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing, and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services, and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs. Franchised, Licensed, and Unconsolidated Joint Venture PropertiesWe have franchising, licensing, and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems. Under our hotel franchising programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. We are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and, in some cases, own hotels. Some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels. We recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “Equity in earnings” caption of our Income Statements. Franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. We also receive royalty fees under license agreements with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (“MVW”), our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011, and Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (“Vistana”), a subsidiary of Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (“ILG”), which acquired Starwood’s vacation timeshare operations before the Merger Date. MVW is the worldwide developer, marketer, and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands. Vistana is the worldwide developer, marketer, seller, and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Westin and Sheraton brands, and under the St. Regis and The Luxury Collection brands for certain existing properties. We receive license fees from both MVW and Vistana consisting of a fixed annual fee, adjusted for inflation, plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes.MVW offers Marriott Rewards® Points and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards® Points, and Vistana offers SPG points, to their owners or potential owners as sales, tour, and financing incentives, in exchange for vacation ownership usage rights, for customer referrals, and to resolve customer service issues. MVW buys these points from our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards programs and Vistana buys these points from our Starwood Preferred Guest program.At year-end 2016, we had 4,006 franchised properties (614,405 rooms), 100 unconsolidated joint venture properties (13,106 rooms), and 83 licensed timeshare, fractional, and related properties (20,702 units).ResidentialWe use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate, typically in conjunction with hotel development, and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others. Third-party owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We have used or licensed our JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Westin, and Autograph Collection Hotels brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales. While the worldwide residential market is very large, we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive. 3Table of ContentsSeasonalityIn general, business at company-operated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable. Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.Relationship with Major CustomerWe operate a number of properties under long-term management agreements that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Host”). In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties operated by us under long-term management agreements. See Footnote 20 “Relationship with Major Customer” for more information.Intellectual PropertyWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services. We believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, caring, service, and value to our customers and the traveling public. Accordingly, we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use.Brand Portfolio We believe that our brand portfolio offers the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties in hospitality, offering two overall styles of hotels -- Classic and Distinctive -- each of which we group into three quality tiers: Luxury, Premium, and Select.

At year-end 2016, we licensed 13 credit card programs in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Japan, which include Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest (“SPG”) credit cards. We earn licensing fees based on card usage, and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands.Loyalty Programs, Sales and Marketing, and Reservation Systems. Our customer loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and SPG (collectively “Loyalty Programs”), have 30 participating brands. MVW, Vistana, and other program partners also participate in one or more of our Loyalty Programs. The Loyalty Programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 49 participating airline programs. We believe that our Loyalty Programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2016, Loyalty Programs members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights. While we continue to run our Loyalty Programs in parallel, we encourage the linking of accounts between the Loyalty Programs, allowing instant elite status match, and enabling the transfer of points between the programs. We continue to enhance our Loyalty Program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. Our loyalty member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts. See the “Loyalty Programs” caption in Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.Marriott.com, Starwoodhotels.com, SPG.com, our international sites, and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2016. Our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience, and enable our guests to easily enroll in our Loyalty Programs and book our exclusive Member Rates. Our Look No Further® Best Rate Guarantee ensures best rate integrity, strengthening consumer confidence in our brand, and gives customers access to the same rates when they book through our various direct channels. We also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of customers through our mobile guest services. In addition to existing mobile services like mobile check-in and check-out, in 2016 we expanded to add mobile service requests, now offered at many hotel brands around the globe, enabling guests to engage in a two-way chat with the hotel before their arrival and throughout their stay. Our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience, and to create a superior and memorable stay experience for our guests powered by digital guest services across our hotel portfolio.At year-end 2016, we operated 24 hotel reservation centers, nine in the United States and Canada and 15 in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own two of the U.S. facilities and either lease the others or share space with an existing Marriott property. While pricing is 8Table of Contentsset by our hotels, our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective. Economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners and franchisees, and enhance our fee revenue.We believe our global sales and revenue management organization is a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people, processes, and systems. Our above-property sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around the customer, reducing duplication of sales efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts. We also utilize innovative sophisticated revenue management systems, many of which are proprietary, which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increase efficiency in analysis and decision making, and produce higher property-level revenue for the hotels in our system. Most of the hotels in our system utilize web-based programs to effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. As we further discuss in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” later in this report, we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation, revenue management, and property management systems, in our Loyalty Programs, and in other aspects of our business. We also make certain technologies available to our guests. Keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position. Furthermore, the integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency.Environmental Responsibility and Sustainable Hotels. Our sustainability strategy supports business growth, conservation of natural resources, and protecting our planet through wide-reaching environmental initiatives. Marriott’s environmental goals are to: (1) reduce energy and water consumption by 20 percent from 2007 to 2020; (2) empower our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels; (3) green our multi-billion dollar supply chain; (4) educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve; and (5) address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation. We recognize our responsibility to reduce waste as well as water and energy consumption in our hotels and corporate offices. Our focus remains on continually integrating greater environmental sustainability throughout our business. In the year ahead, we intend to build upon our progress and launch our next generation of sustainability goals. We were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency, conserve water, and support globally significant projects that reduce deforestation. We use Energy and Environmental Action plans to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals. Working in partnership with the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification, Marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels. Marriott has one of the largest portfolios of LEED-certified buildings in the hospitality industry with 111 certified properties and over 180 more in the development pipeline.Global Design Division. Our Global Design division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts. Similar to third-party contractors, Global Design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties.CompetitionWe encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. According to lodging industry data, there are approximately 1,044 lodging management companies in the United States, including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria.During the last recession, demand for hotel rooms declined significantly, particularly in 2009, and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience. While demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2016, cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse. We would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, in order to help maintain or increase our market share.Affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the U.S. lodging industry, and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests, owners, and franchisees. In 2016, approximately 60 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. In the franchising business, we face a number of competitors that have 9Table of Contentsstrong brands and customer appeal, including Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hyatt, Wyndham, Accor, Choice, Carlson Rezidor, Best Western, La Quinta, and others.Outside the United States, branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers decline, international travel accelerates, and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.Based on lodging industry data, we have more than a 14 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a four percent share of the lodging market outside the United States. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems, and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to customer preference across all of our brands.Properties that we operate, franchise, or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties. Properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion.Employee RelationsAt year-end 2016, we had approximately 226,500 employees, approximately 23,000 of whom were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.Environmental ComplianceThe properties we operate or develop are subject to national, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. Those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our operation and development of properties complies, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future.Internet Address and Company SEC FilingsOur primary Internet address is Marriott.com. On the investor relations portion of our website, Marriott.com/investor, we provide a link to our electronic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports. We make all such filings available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. 10Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors. Forward-Looking StatementsWe make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations, which follow under the headings “Business and Overview,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by, or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or similar expressions.Any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.Risks and UncertaintiesWe are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition. You should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forward-looking statements contained in this report or in other Company communications. Because there is no way to determine in advance whether, or to what extent, any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business, you should give equal weight to each of the following:Our industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for customers. We operate in markets that contain many competitors. Each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains, as well as home and apartment sharing services, in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services, including our loyalty programs and consumer-facing technology platforms and services, from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas, our operating margins could contract, our market share could decrease, and our earnings could decline. Further, new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets.Economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth. Weak economic conditions in some parts of the world, the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions, changes in oil prices and currency values, potential disruptions in the U.S. economy that might result from the new U.S. administration’s policies in such areas as trade, immigration, healthcare, and related issues, political instability in some areas, and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue, could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry. U.S. government travel is also a significant part of our business, and this aspect of our business may continue to suffer due to U.S. federal spending cuts or government hiring freezes and any further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction. As a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty, we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets. Recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue, and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen. Risks Relating to Our Integration of StarwoodThe diversion of resources and management’s attention to the integration of Starwood could adversely affect our day-to-day business. The integration of Starwood places a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results.We may not be able to integrate Starwood successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining Starwood and Marriott may not be realized. We decided to acquire Starwood with the expectation that the Starwood Combination will result in various benefits, including, among other things, operating efficiencies. Achieving those anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we can integrate the business of Starwood in an efficient and effective manner, and we cannot assure you that those benefits will be realized at all or as quickly as we expect. If we do not achieve those benefits, our costs could increase, our expected net income could decrease, and our future business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could suffer. 11Table of ContentsThe integration process could take longer than we anticipate and involve unanticipated costs. Disruptions of each company’s ongoing businesses, processes, and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, and compensation arrangements could adversely affect the combined company. We may also have difficulty addressing differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies, and in harmonizing our different reservations and other systems and business practices. Although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will over time offset the substantial incremental transaction and merger-related costs and charges we incurred in connection with the Starwood Combination, we may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all.Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations. With completion of the Starwood Combination, the size of our business has increased significantly. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate.We may not be able to retain Legacy-Starwood personnel successfully. The success of the Starwood Combination will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key Legacy-Starwood employees. It remains possible that these employees may decide not to remain with us. If key Legacy-Starwood employees who we would like to retain terminate their employment, the loss of institutional knowledge and key business relationships could cause our business to suffer.Risks Relating to Our BusinessOperational RisksPremature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance. Our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee, or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section, which we fail or elect not to cure. In addition, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, including us (or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts”). This means, among other things, that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise, and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future. In addition, some management and franchise agreements may be terminated, or property owners may attempt to terminate such agreements, in connection with the Starwood Combination. If terminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement. A significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.Our lodging operations are subject to global, regional, and national conditions. Because we conduct our business on a global platform, changes in global and regional economies impact our activities. In recent years, decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business. Our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of our operating regions, the resulting unknown pace of business travel, and any future incidents or changes in those regions.The growing significance of our operations outside of the United States, including as a result of the Starwood Combination, makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits, disrupt our business, or damage our reputation. At year-end 2016, we operated or franchised hotels and resorts in 122 countries and territories. With the acquisition of Starwood, the hotels we operate or franchise outside of the United States represented more than 36 percent of the rooms in our system at year-end 2016. We expect that our international operations, and resulting revenues, will continue to grow. As a result, we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the United States, many of which are outside of our control, and which could reduce our revenues or profits, increase our costs, result in significant liabilities or sanctions, otherwise disrupt our business, or damage our reputation. These challenges include: (1) compliance with complex and changing laws, regulations and government policies that may impact our operations, such as foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, and trade restrictions; (2) compliance with U.S. and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad, such as competition laws, currency regulations, and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations; (3) limitations on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax effective manner, or in some cases at all due to foreign exchange restrictions; (4) the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; (5) uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and 12Table of Contentsintellectual property rights under local laws; (6) rapid changes in government policy, political or civil unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, acts of terrorism, or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and (7) currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations.Any failure by our international operations to comply with anti-corruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our growth, harm our reputation, or subject us to broader liability. We are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and anti-corruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations, such as the UK Bribery Act. Anti-corruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons in order to receive or retain business. These laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records. As a result of the Starwood Combination, we now have more properties in countries outside of the U.S., including in many parts of the world where corruption is common, and our compliance with anti-corruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices. The compliance programs, internal controls and policies we and, prior to the Merger Date, Starwood, maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may not prevent our associates, contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations. We are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules. The United States may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business. Depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed, our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected. Any violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, reduce our profits, disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business, damage our reputation, or result in lawsuits being brought against the Company or its officers or directors. In addition, the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations, reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities, or cease operations in certain countries, that would otherwise support growth.In connection with the Starwood Combination, we are currently assessing various regulatory compliance matters at several foreign Legacy-Starwood locations, including compliance with the FCPA. The results of this assessment may give rise to contingencies that could require us to record balance sheet liabilities or accrue expenses, the amounts of which we are not able to currently estimate.Exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results. We earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of U.S. dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the U.S. dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues. We are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our business outside of the U.S. are generally reported in local currency, which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates and the U.S. dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our non-U.S. operations increases. Our efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees may not be successful. In this regard, these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business, do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover, and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk. Some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit. Some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. We may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees, which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows. Our new programs and new branded products may not be successful. We cannot assure you that recently launched, newly acquired, or recently announced brands, such as EDITION, AC Hotels by Marriott in the Americas, Protea Hotels, Moxy Hotels, Delta Hotels, and those we acquired as a result of the Starwood Combination, or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future, will be accepted by hotel owners, potential franchisees, or the traveling public or other customers. We also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products, or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful. In addition, some of our new or newly acquired brands involve or may involve cooperation and/or consultation with one or more third parties, including some shared control over product design and development, sales and marketing, and brand standards. Disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands and/or impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands. 13Table of ContentsRisks relating to natural or man-made disasters, contagious disease, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our revenues. So called “Acts of God,” such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in the Northeastern United States, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and man-made disasters in recent years as well as the potential spread of contagious diseases such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), Zika virus, and Ebola in locations where we own, manage, or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers, could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging. Actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest, or civil strife, such as recent events in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Charlotte, Berlin, Brussels, Paris, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia, the Middle East, and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect. Any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them, both of which could adversely affect our profits.Disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives. Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own very few of our lodging properties. The nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements, which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product, service or systems initiatives, the timing and amount of capital investments, and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs. Such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker. We seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners, but we are not always able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation, and could do so in the future. If any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment, settlement, or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained.Our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations. Events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands. If the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations could be affected.If our brands, goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we had $16.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including $6.5 billion attributable to the Legacy-Starwood brands (based on the preliminary purchase accounting for the Starwood Combination), a significant increase over the $2.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we had as of December 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill acquired in the Starwood Combination could increase over the year following the acquisition if we determine that the value of physical assets acquired is less than, or the amount of liabilities assumed (including under Starwood’s guest loyalty program) is greater than, we preliminarily estimated. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in customers’ perception of and the reputation of the Legacy-Starwood brands, or changes in interest rates, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation. We franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging, timeshare, residential services, and our credit card programs. Under the terms of their agreements with us, our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names. If these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience operational problems, including any data breach involving customer information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer. Although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee, including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances, pursuing any such recourse, remedy, or termination could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance.Damage to, or losses involving, properties that we own, manage, or franchise may not be covered by insurance. We have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed, leased, and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary, and require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain, or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as 14Table of Contentsearthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems, may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for guarantees, debt, or other financial obligations for the property.Development and Financing RisksWhile we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, our hotel owners depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels, and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary. In order to fund new hotel investments, as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels, both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money. The availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors, over which we can exert little control. The difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments. In addition, owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity.Our growth strategy depends upon third-party owners/operators, and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable. Our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners. The terms of our management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.Our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments. Our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised Marriott brands is affected, and may potentially be limited, by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally. These include site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals, and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors, such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements, costs of construction, and anticipated room rate structure.Our development activities expose us to project cost, completion, and resale risks. We develop new hotel and residential properties, both directly and through partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures with third parties. As demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2015 and 2014 in connection with our development and construction of three EDITION hotels and residences, our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks, including that: (1) continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability, or that of third parties with whom we do business, to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties; (2) properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate, potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges; (3) construction delays, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or so called “Acts of God” such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations; and (4) we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion.Our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks. Although we had relatively few owned and leased properties at the end of 2016, we acquired significant numbers of those properties as part of the Starwood Combination, and such properties are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property. Although we intend to sell most of our owned and leased properties over the next two years, equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly, and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all. Moreover, the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties, and the expenses incurred. A variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and/or time-consuming to develop real property or expand, modify, or renovate hotels. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding, or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property. Finally, under eminent domain laws, governments can take real property. Sometimes this taking is for less 15Table of Contentscompensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Despite our asset-light strategy, our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. If our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, including needed capital expenditures, our income will be adversely affected.Development activities that involve our co-investment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs, impair project operations, or increase project completion risks. Partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties which we have entered into or acquired as part of the Starwood Combination generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies, or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. Actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay, increased project costs, or operational difficulties following project completion. Such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments.Investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk. In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, Starwood, and to the lesser extent Marriott, has from time to time invested, and we may continue to invest, as a co-venturer. Such arrangements often have shared control over the operation of the assets. Therefore, such investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-venturer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations. Should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of venture’s liabilities. Also, our venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals, may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, or may make requests contrary to our policies or objectives. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our venture partners and, alternatively, our venture partners could take actions binding on the venture or partnership without our consent. Therefore, actions by a co-venturer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk. We cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful despite these risks.Risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits. In certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate, directly or through noncontrolling interests and/or licensing agreements, in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands, including residences and condominiums under our JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Westin, and Autograph Collection Hotels brand names and trademarks. Such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business, which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity, including the following: (1) weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands; (2) increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay; and (3) residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims, and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant.Some hotel openings in our existing development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. We report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline, including hotels under construction and under signed contracts, as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. The eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and, in particular, the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract, is subject to numerous risks, including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our development pipeline, and in particular hotels not yet under contract, will result in new hotels that enter our system, or that those hotels will open when we anticipate.If we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties, our profits could decline. At times, we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures in connection with entering into or amending management or franchise agreements. From time to time we also provide third-party lenders financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise, generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings. We could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded.If owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties, our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed. The owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced. If those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, the 16Table of Contentslenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt, and repossess the property. Such sales or repossessions could, in some cases, result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Technology, Information Protection, and Privacy RisksA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position. The lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our reservation, revenue management, and property management systems, our Loyalty Programs, and technologies we make available to our guests. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated, and/or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis, and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.An increase in the use of third-party Internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business. Some of our hotel rooms are booked through Internet travel intermediaries such as Expedia.com®, Priceline.com®, Booking.com™, Travelocity.com®, and Orbitz.com®, as well as lesser-known online travel service providers. These intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel, but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings. Although Marriott’s and Starwood’s respective Best Rate Guarantee programs have helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels, intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers, including the purchase, by certain companies, of trademarked online keywords such as “Marriott” from Internet search engines such as Google®, Bing®, Yahoo®, and Baidu® to steer customers toward their websites (a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court). Although Marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries, the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely. Our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services, diverting bookings away from Marriott and Starwood direct online channels, or through their fees increasing the overall cost of Internet bookings for our hotels. In addition, if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries as our contracts with them come up for periodic renewal, our hotels might no longer appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result.We are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of internal and customer data. Our businesses process, use, and transmit large volumes of internal employee and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties, including our owners, franchisees and licensees, as well as our service providers, in areas such as human resources outsourcing, website hosting, and various forms of electronic communications. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee, and company data is critical to our business. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we could make faulty decisions. Our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we, as well as our owners, franchisees, licensees, and service providers, will adequately protect their personal information. The information, security, and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate. Our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners, franchisees, licensees, and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. Cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our, including our owners’, franchisees’, licensees’, or service providers’, information systems and records. Our reliance on computer, Internet-based and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. Breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our owners, franchisees, licensees, or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. In addition, although we carry cyber/privacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other related breaches. Furthermore, in the future such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.Changes in privacy law could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively. We are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information, 17Table of Contentsincluding foreign data protection laws, various U.S. federal and state laws, and credit card industry security standards and other applicable information privacy and security standards. Compliance with changes in applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing, online advertising, and postal mailings. Any further restrictions in laws such as the CANSPAM Act, and various U.S. state laws, or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, online advertising, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products. We also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials. If access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired.Any disruption in the functioning of our reservation system, such as in connection with our integration of Starwood, could adversely affect our performance and results. We manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online, through our mobile app, or through our telephone call centers, or through intermediaries like travel agents, Internet travel websites, and other distribution channels. The cost, speed, accuracy and efficiency of our reservation system are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands. Our business may suffer if we fail to maintain, upgrade, or prevent disruption to our reservation system. In addition, the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation system could increase in connection with the system integration that we anticipate undertaking as part of our integration of Starwood. Disruptions in or changes to our reservation system could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data.Other RisksChanges in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs. We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, and policies in jurisdictions around the world, including those for financial reporting, taxes, healthcare, and the environment. Changes to these laws, regulations, or policies, including those associated with health care, tax or financial reforms, could reduce our profits. We also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures, and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions, costs, or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits. In particular, governments may revise tax laws, regulations, or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. For example, most U.S. company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the United States is generally taxed at local rates, which are often much lower than U.S. tax rates. If changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced. If such increases resulted from our status as a U.S. company, those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.If we cannot attract and retain talented associates, our business could suffer. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop, and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses. Any shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs, which could reduce our profits.Delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our Board of Directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts. Under the Delaware business combination statute, a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without Board of Director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, among other things, require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our Board of Directors could, without shareholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a shareholder rights plan.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 20Table of ContentsItem 4.

All fiscal years presented before 2013 included 52 weeks, except for 2008 which included 53 weeks.(2) Balances do not reflect the impact of discontinued operations. Also, for periods before 2009, we reclassified our provision for loan losses associated with our lodging operations to the “General, administrative, and other” caption of our Income Statements to conform to our presentation for periods beginning in 2009. This reclassification only affected operating income.(3) The following businesses became discontinued operations in the year we announced that we would sell or exit them: synthetic fuel (2007).(4) We issued stock dividends in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and have adjusted all per share data retroactively to reflect those stock dividends. (5) Represents fee revenue from the United States (but not Hawaii before 2011) and Canada.(6) Represents fee revenue outside of North America, as defined in footnote (5) above.(7) In 2015, we adopted ASU No. 2015-03, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs, and ASU No. 2015-17, which changes the classification of deferred taxes. Years before 2014 have not been adjusted for these new accounting standards. 23Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverviewWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 122 countries and territories under 30 brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We group our operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International.We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. In most markets, base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. In the Middle East and Asia, incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves.Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Loyalty Programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. 24Table of ContentsAcquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts WorldwideOn the Merger Date, we completed the Starwood Combination. Our Income Statements reflect a net loss of $39 million for Starwood’s results of operations for the period from September 23, 2016 to December 31, 2016, including merger-related costs and charges, net of tax, of $194 million. The combination of our brands creates a more comprehensive portfolio, enhances our global market distribution, and provides opportunities for cost efficiencies. Our combined company now operates or franchises over 6,000 properties with nearly 1.2 million rooms. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.Our RevPAR statistics for 2016, and for 2016 compared to 2015, include Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for both full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Starwood Combination. Therefore, our RevPAR statistics include Legacy-Starwood properties for periods during which fees from the Legacy-Starwood properties are not included in our Income Statements. We provide these RevPAR statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. Our RevPAR statistics for 2015, and for 2015 compared to 2014, are for Legacy-Marriott comparable properties only, as Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands at any time during that two-year period. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the Starwood Combination, that were open and operating under one of our Legacy-Marriott or Legacy-Starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2015 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. For 2016 compared to 2015, we had 3,698 comparable North American properties (including 483 Legacy-Starwood properties) and 965 comparable International properties (including 506 Legacy-Starwood properties). For 2015 compared to 2014, we had 3,077 comparable North American properties and 367 comparable International properties.We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Business Trends Our 2016 results reflected a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system, favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world, and slow but steady economic growth. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2016 increased 1.8 percent to $113.50, ADR increased 1.0 percent on a constant dollar basis to $156.53, and occupancy increased 0.6 percentage points to 72.5 percent, compared to 2015.In North America, 2016 lodging demand for our brands reflected increased transient business, driven by higher retail and government travel, but weaker premium-priced corporate transient demand. Group business was higher in most of 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply, weak demand from the oil and gas industries, the impact of the strong dollar on international travel to U.S. gateway markets, and moderate GDP growth. The 2017 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels in North America was up more than two percent as of year-end 2016, compared to the 2016 group pace measured as of year-end 2015. 25Table of ContentsOur Europe region experienced higher demand in 2016 across most countries, led by Spain, Portugal and Russia, partially constrained by weaker demand in France, Belgium, and Turkey following terrorism events in those countries. In our Asia Pacific region in 2016, RevPAR growth was strong in India and Thailand, while RevPAR growth in China was constrained in Hong Kong and certain southern and tertiary China markets. Middle East demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability, oversupply in Dubai and Qatar, and lower oil prices. In South Africa, results were favorable in 2016, reflecting strong local demand and higher international tourism attracted by the weak South African Rand. In the Caribbean and Latin America, growth from strong demand in Mexico and the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was offset by concerns relating to the Zika Virus in the Caribbean and weak economic conditions in most markets in South America.We monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. Our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.Compared to 2015, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2016 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 2.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls primarily at our Legacy-Marriott properties. North American company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 4.4 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 20 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 0.7 percent compared to 2015. System Growth and PipelineIn 2016, we added 348 properties with 55,321 rooms, in addition to the 1,342 properties and 381,440 rooms gained with the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date. Approximately 40 percent of the added rooms are located outside North America, and 18 percent are conversions from competitor brands. Of the rooms gained with the Starwood Combination, approximately 50 percent are located outside North America. In 2016, 34 properties (5,691 rooms) exited our system. At the end of 2016, including rooms under Legacy-Starwood brands, we had more than 420,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, and nearly 34,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. More than half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside North America.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. 26Table of ContentsBrand StatisticsThe following brand statistics for 2016, and for 2016 compared to 2015, include Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for both full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Starwood Combination. The statistics for 2015, and for 2015 compared to 2014, are for Legacy-Marriott comparable properties only, as Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands at any time during that two-year period.2016 Compared to 2015. The following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR for comparable properties under our Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood brands in North America and in our International regions.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated revenues, operating income, and non-operating income for 2016, 2015, and 2014. In accordance with GAAP, we include the business that we acquired in the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date through year-end 2016.Revenues2016 Compared to 2015. The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.

In North America, 65 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in 2016 compared to 63 percent in 2015. Outside North America, 74 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in both 2016 and 2015, representing 48 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2016 from Legacy-Marriott managed properties compared to 51 percent of our total fees in 2015. The $25 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected $38 million of higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees, partially offset by $13 million of lower owned and leased revenue. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected lower revenues from properties that converted to managed ($60 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), partially offset by improved sales from several properties following renovations ($29 million), stronger sales at other existing properties across our segments ($28 million), and favorable results at two new owned properties ($9 million).Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our Loyalty Programs, reservations, and marketing programs. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $568 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected the impact of higher property occupancies, unit growth across our system, and growth in the Marriott Rewards program membership and activity.2015 Compared to 2014. The following discussion presents our analysis of our revenues for 2015 compared to 2014. ($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage change 2015 vs. 2014Base management fees $698 $672 $26 4 %Franchise fees853 745 108 14 %Incentive management fees 319 302 17 6 % 1,870 1,719 151 Owned, leased, and other revenue 986 1,022 (36) (4)%Cost reimbursements 11,630 11,055 575 5 % $14,486 $13,796 $690 The $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger RevPAR ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million).The $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher RevPAR and house profit margins primarily at company-managed North American properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. Higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the Delta Hotels acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation. In 2015, 68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 represented 63 percent of properties in North America and 74 percent outside of North America, compared to 36 percent in North America and 73 percent outside of North America in 2014. The 31Table of Contentspercentage of North American properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 primarily due to a few large North American Limited-Service portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014. In addition, in 2015, 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of North America versus 56 percent in 2014. The $36 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue reflected $44 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Protea Hotels in the 2014 second quarter. Lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from Protea Hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from The Miami Beach EDITION hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions.”The $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. In 2015, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system.Operating Income2016 Compared to 2015. Operating income increased by $18 million to $1,368 million in 2016 from $1,350 million in 2015. The increase in operating income reflected a $349 million increase in fee revenue, which we discuss in the preceding “Revenues” section, a $386 million increase in merger-related costs and charges which we discuss in Footnote 4 “Merger-Related Costs and Charges,” as well as the following changes. The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.($ in millions)2016 2015 Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change due to Starwood Change Excluding Starwood ImpactOwned, leased, and other revenue$1,307 $986 $321 $296 $25 3 %Owned, leased, and other - direct expense900 733 167 207 (40) (5)% 407 253 154 89 65 26 %Depreciation, amortization, and other168 139 29 43 (14) (10)%General, administrative, and other704 634 70 79 (9) (1)%Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations increased by $65 million. The increase was largely attributable to $39 million in higher branding fees and $25 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses. The $25 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $17 million of net stronger performance at several properties following renovations, $15 million overall favorable results across our segments, and $4 million of lower pre-opening costs, partially offset by $10 million of lower profits from properties that converted from owned to managed. Depreciation, amortization, and other expense for Legacy-Marriott operations decreased by $14 million. The decrease primarily reflected a favorable variance to the 2015 impairment charges on the EDITION hotels ($12 million) and corporate equipment ($4 million).General, administrative, and other expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations decreased by $9 million. The decrease primarily reflected $15 million in lower reserves for guarantee funding, and $9 million in lower foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher administrative costs to grow our brands globally, $4 million of higher bad debt reserves, and $3 million net unfavorable impact to our legal expenses associated with 2015 litigation resolutions. 32Table of Contents2015 Compared to 2014. Operating income increased by $191 million to $1,350 million in 2015 from $1,159 million in 2014. The increase in operating income reflected a $151 million increase in fee revenue, which we discuss in the preceding “Revenues” section, as well as the following changes. ($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage change 2015 vs. 2014Owned, leased, and other revenue$986 $1,022 $(36) (4)%Owned, leased, and other - direct expense733 775 (42) (5)% 253 247 6 2 %Depreciation, amortization, and other139 148 (9) (6)%General, administrative, and other634 659 (25) (4)%The $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $4 million in higher branding fees. Owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was unchanged as stronger results at several of our International properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, were offset by $10 million of weaker performance due to renovations.The $9 million decrease in depreciation, amortization, and other expense reflected a $25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the EDITION hotels, partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of $6 million for The Miami Beach EDITION residences and $6 million for The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION and a $4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment.The $25 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses largely reflected a $28 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with litigation resolutions, $24 million of development costs that we deferred in 2015 related to our growing franchise pipeline, and $5 million in lower foreign exchange losses compared to the 2014 devaluation of assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars, partially offset by $20 million of higher costs incurred to grow our brands globally, $5 million of transaction costs related to the Starwood Combination, and $5 million from the Delta Hotels acquisition.Non-Operating Income (Expense) and Income Taxes 2016 Compared to 2015. The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.($ in millions)2016 2015 Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change due to Starwood Change Excluding Starwood ImpactGains and other income, net$5 $27 $(22) $1 $(23) (85)%Interest expense(234) (167) 67 15 52 31 %Interest income35 29 6 2 4 14 %Equity in earnings10 16 (6) 5 (11) (69)%Provision for income taxes(404) (396) 8 4 4 1 %Gains and other income, net for Legacy-Marriott operations decreased by $23 million primarily due to the net gain that we recorded in the prior year, which consisted of a $41 million gain on the redemption of a preferred equity ownership interest, partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an International property and a $4 million disposal loss for a North American Limited-Service segment plot of land.Interest expense for Legacy-Marriott operations, including interest expense on debt incurred for the Starwood Combination, increased by $52 million. The increase was primarily due to a net increase in Senior Notes interest expense ($18 million) from the issuances of Series Q through W Notes in 2016 and Series O and P Notes in 2015, partially offset by the maturities of Series H Notes in 2016 and Series G Notes in 2015. The remaining increase is primarily due to the amortization of costs for a bridge term loan facility commitment that we obtained in the 2016 first quarter ($13 million), net lower capitalized interest primarily as a result of the completion of The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION in 2015 ($9 million), and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings ($7 million). Interest income for Legacy-Marriott operations increased by $4 million primarily due to higher interest income on a loan that we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a North American Limited-Service property in the 2015 fourth quarter ($8 million), partially offset by lower interest income on two repaid loans ($6 million).Equity in earnings for Legacy-Marriott operations decreased by $11 million primarily reflecting a net unfavorable variance to three adjustments recorded in 2015, which consisted of a reversal of a litigation reserve ($11 million) and a 33Table of Contentsreduction of an International investee’s liabilities ($5 million), partially offset by an impairment charge on an International joint venture ($6 million).Provision for income taxes for Legacy-Marriott operations increased by $4 million primarily due to tax rate changes in several jurisdictions ($12 million), higher earnings from foreign operations ($6 million), and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 U.S. and foreign true-ups ($5 million), partially offset by lower U.S. earnings due to merger-related expenses ($11 million) and the release of a valuation allowance ($8 million).2015 Compared to 2014. The following discussion presents our analysis of our revenues for 2015 compared to 2014. ($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage change 2015 vs. 2014Gains and other income, net$27 $8 $19 238 %Interest expense(167) (115) 52 45 %Interest income29 30 (1) (3)%Equity in earnings16 6 10 167 %Provision for income taxes(396) (335) 61 18 %Gains and other income, net increased by $19 million. The increase primarily reflects the $41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest. The increase was partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an International property and a $4 million expected disposal loss for a North American Limited-Service segment plot of land.Interest expense increased by $52 million. The increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of The Miami Beach EDITION in the 2014 fourth quarter and The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION in the 2015 second quarter ($25 million), interest on the Series O Notes and Series P Notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the Series N Notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter ($17 million), and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion true-up ($7 million).Interest income decreased by $1 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter ($5 million), partially offset by higher interest income on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an International property in the 2014 second quarter ($5 million). Equity in earnings increased by $10 million. The increase reflects a $22 million year-over-year impact from the reversal in 2015 of an $11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an International investee’s liabilities. The increase was partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge relating to an International joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our International investments following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate. Our provision for income taxes increased by $61 million. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a U.S. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program, the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance, and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue. The increase was partially offset by a favorable IRS settlement relating to share-based compensation ($12 million), a tax benefit from an International property disposition ($7 million), and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction ($5 million).BUSINESS SEGMENTSWe are a diversified global lodging company with operations in three reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International.

The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.

Higher base management and franchise fees for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily due to $30 million of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. Increased incentive management fees for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels.Higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations primarily reflected $21 million of higher branding fees, $10 million of favorable operating results at several properties, and $6 million of lower pre-opening costs.Lower general, administrative, and other expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily due to $6 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding and $5 million of lower administrative costs.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Legacy-Marriott North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $8,161 million in 2016, compared to $7,911 million in 2015.2015 Compared to 2014 ($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014Segment revenues$8,825 $8,323 $502 6%Segment profits$561 $524 $37 7%In 2015, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 57 properties (15,345 rooms), including 37 properties (9,590 rooms) from the Delta Hotels acquisition, and five properties (1,398 rooms) left our system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Full-Service properties increased by 4.6 percent to $136.95, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.6 percentage points to 73.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.8 percent to $187.40.The $37 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, was driven by $44 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $10 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense. Base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger RevPAR driven by rate and unit growth, partially offset by $5 million of contract modifications and terminations. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels.Lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $8 million of weaker performance at a North American Full-Service property under renovation. 37Table of ContentsGeneral, administrative, and other expenses were higher due to $5 million from the Delta Hotels acquisition and $2 million in higher reserves for guarantee funding, partially offset by $3 million of other property expenses incurred in 2014.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $7,911 million in 2015, compared to $7,465 million in 2014.North American Limited-Service 2016 Compared to 2015 In 2016, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 451 properties (60,637 rooms), including 226 properties (34,294 rooms) from the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date, and 8 properties (880 rooms) left our system.The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.($ in millions)2016 2015 Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change due to Starwood Change Excluding Starwood ImpactSegment revenues$3,561 $3,193 $368 $58 $310 10%Segment profits$698 $651 $47 $9 $38 6%The $38 million increase in segment profits for Legacy-Marriott operations, compared to 2015, reflected $14 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $5 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $4 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $3 million of higher gains and other income, net, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense.Base management and franchise fees for Legacy-Marriott operations were higher primarily reflecting $50 million from new units and stronger RevPAR, partially offset by $24 million of lower relicensing fees and an $11 million decrease in deferred fee recognition. Increased incentive management fees for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily driven by $10 million of higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios. Higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected higher net earnings at several leased and owned properties.Lower general, administrative, and other expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily due to $7 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding.Higher gains and other income, net for Legacy-Marriott operations primarily reflected a favorable variance to the $4 million prior year disposal loss for a North American Limited-Service segment plot of land.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Legacy-Marriott North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $2,646 million in 2016, compared to $2,366 million in 2015.2015 Compared to 2014($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014Segment revenues$3,193 $2,962 $231 8%Segment profits$651 $574 $77 13%In 2015, across our North American Limited-Service segment we added 173 properties (19,712 rooms) and 26 properties (2,820 rooms) left our system. The majority of the properties that left our system were Fairfield Inn & Suites and Residence Inn properties. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, RevPAR for comparable systemwide North American Limited-Service properties increased by 5.6 percent to $94.99, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.5 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.9 percent to $127.65.The $77 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, reflected $73 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $13 million of higher incentive management fees, $2 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $1 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $5 million of lower owned, 38Table of Contentsleased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of lower equity in earnings.Base management and franchise fees were higher due to unit growth and stronger room rates, including $19 million of higher franchise licensing and application fees, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in previously deferred fees and $3 million of contract terminations. Increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners’ priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees.Lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $3 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties.Gains and other income, net were lower due to a $4 million expected disposal loss on a plot of land. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Lower equity in earnings was driven by the redemption of our investment in an entity that owns two hotels.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $2,366 million in 2015, compared to $2,217 million in 2014.International2016 Compared to 2015 In 2016, across our International regions we added 789 properties (213,683 rooms), including 696 properties (191,841 rooms) from the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date, and 23 properties (4,082 rooms) left our system.The table below presents the impact of the Starwood Combination starting from the Merger Date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our Legacy-Marriott brands discussed following the table.($ in millions)2016 2015 Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change due to Starwood Change Excluding Starwood ImpactSegment revenues$2,636 $2,200 $436 $399 $37 2%Segment profits$407 $292 $115 $111 $4 1%The $4 million increase in segment profits for Legacy-Marriott operations, compared to 2015, consisted of $12 million of higher gains and other income, net, $7 million of higher incentive management fees, $1 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $1 million of higher equity in earnings, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense.Higher base management and franchise fees for Legacy-Marriott operations were due to $19 million of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $17 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The increase in incentive management fees for Legacy-Marriott operations was primarily due to an $8 million increase in deferred fee recognition and $5 million from new managed properties, partially offset by the impact of $7 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations largely reflected $13 million net stronger performance at several properties following renovations, partially offset by $9 million from a property that converted from owned to managed. Higher general, administrative, and other expenses for Legacy-Marriott operations were primarily due to a $12 million increase in administrative costs to grow our brands globally and a $5 million increase in property expenses.Higher gains and other income, net for Legacy-Marriott operations was primarily due to an $11 million prior year disposal loss for an International property.Higher equity in earnings for Legacy-Marriott operations primarily reflected a net unfavorable variance to two adjustments recorded in 2015, which consisted of a reduction of an International investee’s liabilities ($5 million) and an impairment charge on an International joint venture ($6 million).Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our Legacy-Marriott International properties totaled $1,344 million in 2016, compared to $1,282 million in 2015. 39Table of Contents2015 Compared to 2014($ in millions)2015 2014 Change 2015 vs. 2014Segment revenues$2,200 $2,255 $(55) (2)%Segment profits$292 $295 $(3) (1)%In 2015, across our International regions we added 70 properties (16,490 rooms) and 20 properties (2,110 rooms) left our system.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, RevPAR for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 5.1 percent to $124.13, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.1 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.1 percent to $171.20.The $3 million decrease in segment profits in 2015, compared to 2014, consisted of $12 million of lower gains and other income, net, $9 million of lower equity in earnings, $6 million of lower incentive management fees, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $18 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense. Base management and franchise fees increased due to stronger RevPAR, driven by both occupancy and rate, and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $16 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Lower incentive management fees reflected $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth. Higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected favorable operating results at several of our properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, and $7 million of increased termination fees, partially offset by $4 million in lower branding fees and $2 million from a property that converted to managed.Lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense was driven by amortization true-ups and lower depreciation from an International property sold in 2015, partially offset by $5 million of higher depreciation at several of our leased properties.General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher costs for branding and service initiatives to grow our brands globally.Lower gains and other income, net primarily reflected an $11 million loss on the sale of an International property discussed in Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions.”Lower equity in earnings reflected an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our International investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate, and a $6 million impairment charge relating to an International joint venture, partially offset by a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an International investee’s liabilities.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our International properties totaled $1,282 million in 2015, compared to $1,305 million in 2014.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONWe award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We also issue performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) to named executive officers and some of their direct reports under their Stock Plan. See Footnote 6 “Share-Based Compensation” for more information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. 40Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesIn the 2016 second quarter, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility and increase the aggregate amount of available borrowings to up to $4,000 million, up to $2,500 million of which was initially available, with the full $4,000 million becoming available to us with the closing of the Starwood Combination. The availability of the Credit Facility supports our commercial paper program and general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. In addition, we used borrowings under the Credit Facility, all of which we later repaid, to finance part of the cash component of the consideration we paid to Starwood shareholders and certain fees and expenses we incurred in connection with the Starwood Combination. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. The term of the facility expires on June 10, 2021. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), giving pro forma effect for certain material acquisitions, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. In connection with the Starwood Combination, we exercised our option to temporarily increase the maximum permitted leverage under the Credit Facility to 4.5 to 1 for the 2016 third and fourth quarters and the 2017 first quarter. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, expect to continue to do so once the temporary increase in permitted leverage ends, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2016, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2,545 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,687 million under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $858 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $4,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $2,313 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility). We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of Senior Notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly. 41Table of ContentsCash from OperationsCash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2016 2015 2014Cash from operations$1,582 $1,430 $1,224Non-cash items (1)456 395 328(1) Includes depreciation, amortization, impairments, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2016 and 0.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2015. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in Exhibit 12 to this 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows:Fiscal Years2016 2015 2014 2013 20125.1x 6.4x 6.2x 5.1x 4.6xInvesting Activities Cash FlowsAcquisition of a Business, Net of Cash Acquired. Cash outflows of $2,412 million in 2016 reflect cash consideration to Starwood shareholders, net of cash acquired in the Starwood Combination. Cash outflows of $137 million in 2015 primarily reflect the acquisition of Delta Hotels. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $199 million in 2016, $305 million in 2015, and $411 million in 2014. These included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2016 decreased by $106 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower spending for our EDITION hotels. Capital expenditures in 2015 decreased by $106 million compared to 2014, primarily related to the 2014 development of two EDITION hotels, partially offset by 2015 renovations at a North American Full-Service property and investments in our reservations system.We expect 2017 investment spending will total approximately $500 million to $700 million, including approximately $175 million for maintenance capital spending. Consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, acquisitions, and equity and other investments. Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. In the Starwood Combination, we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels, which we have sold or may seek to sell. We also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include new construction, loans, and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $218 million cash proceeds in 2016 and $673 million in 2015. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $35 million in 2016 compared to net collections of $26 million in 2015. At year-end 2016, we had $248 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans ($245 million noncurrent and $3 million current) outstanding, compared to $221 million ($215 million noncurrent and $6 million current) outstanding at year-end 2015. Our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $27 million, primarily due to $65 million in loans acquired in the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date and loan advances of $32 million, partially offset by loan collections of $67 million. 42Table of ContentsEquity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $14 million in 2016, $7 million in 2015, and $6 million in 2014 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt increased by $4,399 million in 2016, to $8,506 million at year-end 2016 from $4,107 million at year-end 2015, and primarily reflected $1,875 million from the Starwood Combination (much of which was subsequently canceled in exchange for our Series S through W Notes), $1,485 million ($1,500 million face amount) in Series Q and R Notes issuances, and $1,373 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $289 million in Series H Notes that matured in the 2016 second quarter and $24 million of repurchased Starwood senior notes in the 2016 fourth quarter. See Footnote 11 “Long-Term Debt” for additional information on the debt issuances.Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2016, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 2.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.9 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2016.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases. We purchased 8 million shares of our common stock in 2016 at an average price of $71.55 per share, 25.7 million shares in 2015 at an average price of $75.48 per share, and 24.2 million shares in 2014 at an average price of $62.09 per share. At year-end 2016, 31.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared and paid the following quarterly cash dividends in 2016: (1) $0.25 per share declared on February 11, 2016 and paid March 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on February 25, 2016; (2) $0.30 per share declared on May 6, 2016 and paid June 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 20, 2016; (3) $0.30 per share declared on September 13, 2016 and paid September 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 23, 2016; and (4) $0.30 per share declared November 10, 2016 and paid December 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2016. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share on February 10, 2017, payable on March 31, 2017 to shareholders of record on February 24, 2017.Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at year-end 2016: Payments Due by Period($ in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsDebt (1)$9,591 $516 $1,611 $3,791 $3,673Capital lease obligations (1)256 13 26 26 191Operating leases where we are the primary obligor1,742 183 325 251 983Purchase obligations 470 186 242 42 —Other noncurrent liabilities99 5 8 8 78Total contractual obligations$12,158 $903 $2,212 $4,118 $4,925 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2016 of $400 million, including interest and net of deferred tax assets. See Footnote 7 “Income Taxes” for additional information.In addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 43Table of ContentsOther CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our guarantee, investment, and loan commitments at year-end 2016: ($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsGuarantee commitments (expiration by period)$282 $37 $59 $76 $110Investment and loan commitments (expected funding by period)103 87 10 6 —Total other commitments$385 $124 $69 $82 $110In conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner. For further information, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments” caption in Footnote 8 “Commitments and Contingencies.”Letters of CreditAt year-end 2016, we also had $157 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the Credit Facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2016 totaled $149 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSEquity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. We also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.Other Related PartiesWe provide management services for and receive fees from properties owned by JWM Family Enterprises, L.P., which is beneficially owned and controlled by J.W. Marriott, Jr., Deborah Marriott Harrison, and other members of the Marriott family.For more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote 19 “Related Party Transactions.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to those policies.See Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Loyalty Programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs; 44Table of ContentsGoodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;Loan Loss Reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; andBusiness Combinations, including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates, royalty rates, and the amount and timing of future cash flows.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on derivative instruments.The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2016 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period ($ in millions)2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 There-after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$2 $30 $16 $12 $11 $61 $132 $132Average interest rate 3.57% Floating-rate notes receivable$1 $47 $4 $5 $37 $22 $116 $102Average interest rate 3.37% Liabilities - Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(304) $(405) $(844) $(358) $(853) $(3,251) $(6,015) $(5,975)Average interest rate 3.67% Floating-rate debt$— $— $(7) $— $(2,311) $— $(2,318) $(2,318)Average interest rate 1.49% 45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:07:03.151644
1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2018,"Item 7. We refer to our business associated with brands that were in our portfolio before the Starwood Combination as “Legacy-Marriott” and to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.” See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Company-Operated PropertiesAt year-end 2017, we had 1,959 company-operated properties (554,642 rooms), which included properties under long-term management or lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”), properties that we own, and home and condominium communities for which we manage the related owners’ associations.Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and 3Table of Contentsindirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount. Many of our Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. Many of our Operating Agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies. In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.For the lodging facilities we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing, and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services, and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs. Franchised, Licensed, and Unconsolidated Joint Venture PropertiesWe have franchising, licensing, and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems. Under our hotel franchising programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. We are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and, in some cases, own hotels. Some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels. We recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “Equity in earnings” caption of our Income Statements. Franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. We also receive royalty fees under license agreements with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (“MVW”), our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011, and Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (“Vistana”), a subsidiary of Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (“ILG”), which acquired Starwood’s vacation timeshare operations before the Merger Date. MVW is the worldwide developer, marketer, and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands. Vistana is the worldwide developer, marketer, seller, and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Westin and Sheraton brands, and under the St. Regis and The Luxury Collection brands for certain existing properties. We receive license fees from both MVW and Vistana consisting of a fixed annual fee, adjusted for inflation, plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes.At year-end 2017, we had 4,432 franchised and licensed properties (685,365 rooms) and 129 unconsolidated joint venture properties (17,659 rooms).ResidentialWe use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate, often in conjunction with hotel development, and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others. Third-party owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We have used or licensed our JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari, Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, and Autograph Collection brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales. While the worldwide residential market is very large, we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive.SeasonalityIn general, business at company-operated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable. Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.Relationship with Major Customer We operate 84 properties that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Host”) under long-term management agreements. In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties that we operate under long-term management agreements. See Footnote 20 “Relationship with Major Customer” for more information. 4Table of ContentsIntellectual PropertyWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services.

In the 2017 fourth quarter, we reached new multi-year agreements to amend our relationships with JP Morgan Chase and American Express for our U.S.-issued, co-brand credit cards associated with our guest loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest (“SPG”) (which we refer to collectively as our “Loyalty Programs”). At year-end 2017, we also licensed credit card programs in Canada, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Japan. We earn license fees based on card usage, and we believe that our co-brand credit cards have contributed to the success of our Loyalty Programs and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands.Loyalty Programs, Sales and Marketing, and Reservation Systems. Our Loyalty Programs have 29 participating brands. MVW, Vistana, and other program partners also participate in one or more of our Loyalty Programs. The Loyalty Programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 49 participating airline programs. We believe that our Loyalty Programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2017, Loyalty Program members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights. While we continue to run our Loyalty Programs in parallel, we encourage the linking of accounts between the Loyalty Programs, allowing instant elite status match, and enabling the transfer of points between the programs. We continue to enhance our Loyalty Program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing guest base. Our loyalty member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts. See the “Loyalty Programs” caption in Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.Marriott.com, Starwoodhotels.com, SPG.com, our international websites, and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2017. Our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our Loyalty Programs to book our exclusive Member Rates. Our Look No Further® Best Rate Guarantee ensures best rate integrity, strengthening consumer confidence in our brand, and gives guests greater access to the same rates when they book through our various direct channels. We also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of guests through our mobile guest services - check-in, check-out, service requests, mobile key, and more - across our hotel portfolio. In 2017, we introduced mobile check-in to all Legacy-Starwood hotels globally that did not already offer the service, and we greatly expanded the number of hotels across our portfolio that offered mobile key, enabling guests to use their mobile devices as a keycard for room entry and amenity access. We also introduced mobile food ordering at selected properties, enabling guests to order food and beverages on-demand from hotel outlets. Our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience, while elevating the service experience through mobile guest services and generating superior guest satisfaction and more memorable stays at our properties. 8Table of ContentsAt year-end 2017, we operated 23 hotel reservation centers, eight in the U.S. and 15 in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own two of the U.S. facilities and either lease the others or share space with a company-operated property. While pricing is set by our hotels, our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective. Economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners and franchisees, and enhance our fee revenue.We believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people, processes, and systems. Our above-property sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy, reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts. We also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems, many of which are proprietary, which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increasing efficiency and producing higher property-level revenue for hotels in our portfolio. Most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize web-based programs to effectively manage the rate set-up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. As we further discuss in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” later in this report, we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation, revenue management, and property management systems, in our Loyalty Programs, and in other aspects of our business. We also make certain technologies available to our guests. Keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position. Furthermore, the integrity and protection of customer, guest, employee, and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency.Sustainability and Social Impact. Guided by our 2025 Sustainability and Social Impact Goals, as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. In 2017, we launched our new Sustainability and Social Impact Platform, Serve 360: Doing Good In Every Direction. The platform is built around four focus areas: Nurture Our World; Empower Through Opportunity; Sustainable Operations; and Welcome All and Advance Human Rights. Within each of these areas, we have identified a series of goals that we have embarked upon to show progress through 2025. Examples of these goals include commitments to volunteering, investments in our communities, reduction of our environmental impact, and human rights training. Global Design Division. Our Global Design division provides design, development, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts. Like third-party contractors, Global Design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties.Competition We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. According to lodging industry data, there are over 1,100 lodging management companies in the U.S., including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels, operate hotels on behalf of third-party owners, and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria.We also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, search engines such as Google and Bing, and online services including Airbnb and HomeAway that allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms. We compete against lodging operators and other competitors for guests in many areas, including brand recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, security, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points.During the last recession, demand for hotel rooms declined significantly, particularly in 2009, and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience. While demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2017, cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse. We would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain guest loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, to help maintain or increase our market share.Affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the U.S. lodging industry, and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests, owners, and franchisees. In 2017, approximately 71 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. In the franchising business, we face many competitors that have strong 9Table of Contentsbrands and guest appeal, including Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hyatt, Wyndham, Accor, Choice, Carlson Rezidor, Best Western, La Quinta, and others.Outside the U.S., branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers decline, international travel accelerates, and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.Based on lodging industry data, we have an approximately 15 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the U.S. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems, and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands.Properties that we operate, franchise, or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic refurbishment and replacement of furnishings, fixtures, and equipment. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties. Properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion.Employee Relations At year-end 2017, we had approximately 177,000 employees, approximately 23,000 of whom were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.Environmental Compliance The properties we operate or develop are subject to national, regional, state or provincial, and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. Those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our operation and development of properties complies, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future.Internet Address and Company SEC FilingsOur primary Internet address is Marriott.com. On the investor relations portion of our website, Marriott.com/investor, we provide a link to our electronic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports. We make all such filings available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.Item 1A. Risk Factors. Forward-Looking Statements We make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations, which follow under the headings “Business and Overview,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by, or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” or similar expressions.Any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this 10Table of Contentsreport, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether due to new information, future developments, or otherwise.Risks and Uncertainties We are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition. You should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forward-looking statements contained in this report or in other Company communications. Because there is no way to determine in advance whether, or to what extent, any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business, you should give equal weight to each of the following:Our industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for guests. We operate in markets that contain many competitors. Each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains and home and apartment sharing services in national and international venues, and with independent companies in regional markets. Our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services, including our Loyalty Programs and consumer-facing technology platforms and services, from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas, our operating margins could contract, our market share could decrease, and our earnings could decline. Further, new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets.Economic downturns could impact our financial results and growth. Weak economic conditions in one or more parts of the world, changes in oil prices and currency values, potential disruptions in the U.S. economy generally and the travel business in particular that might result from the U.S. administration’s changing policies in such areas as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues, political instability in some areas, and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions could continue, could have a negative impact on the lodging industry. U.S. government travel is also a significant part of our business, and this aspect of our business could suffer due to U.S. federal spending cuts, or government hiring restrictions and any further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction. Because of such uncertainty, we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets. Our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if economic or these other conditions worsen. Risks Relating to Our Integration of StarwoodThe continued diversion of resources and management’s attention to the integration of Starwood could still adversely affect our day-to-day business. While the integration of Starwood is well underway, it places a significant burden on our management and internal resources and will continue to do so for some time. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties we encounter as the integration process continues could adversely affect our financial results.Some of the anticipated benefits of combining Starwood and Marriott may still not be realized. We decided to acquire Starwood with the expectation that the Starwood Combination will result in various benefits, including, among other things, operating efficiencies. Although we have already achieved some of those anticipated benefits, others remain subject to several uncertainties, including whether we can continue to effectively and efficiently integrate the Starwood business and whether, and on what terms, we can reach agreement with the timeshare companies with whom we do business to allow us to move to a single unified reservation system and loyalty platform.Integration could also take longer than we anticipate and involve unexpected costs. Disruptions of each legacy company’s ongoing businesses, processes, and systems could adversely affect the combined company. We also may still encounter difficulties harmonizing our different reservations and other systems and business practices as the integration process continues. Because of these or other factors, we cannot assure you when or that we will be able to fully realize additional benefits from the Starwood Combination in the form of eliminating duplicative costs, or achieving other operating efficiencies, cost savings, or benefits.Risks Relating to Our BusinessOperational RisksPremature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance. Our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee, or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section, which we fail or elect not to cure. Some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, including us (or have 11Table of Contentsinterpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts”). This means, among other things, that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise, and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future. If terminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement. A significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.Our lodging operations are subject to global, regional, and national conditions. Because we conduct our business on a global platform, changes in global and regional economies impact our activities. In recent years, decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures resulting from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business. Our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic and political environment in each of our operating regions, the resulting unknown pace of both business and leisure travel, and any future incidents or changes in those regions.The growing significance of our operations outside of the U.S. makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits, disrupt our business, or damage our reputation. At year-end 2017, approximately 36 percent of the rooms in our system were located outside of the U.S. and its territories. We expect that our international operations, and resulting revenues, will continue to grow. This increasingly exposes us to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the U.S., many of which are outside of our control, and which could reduce our revenues or profits, increase our costs, result in significant liabilities or sanctions, disrupt our business, or damage our reputation. These challenges include: (1) compliance with complex and changing laws, regulations and government policies that may impact our operations, such as foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, and trade restrictions; (2) compliance with U.S. and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad, such as competition laws, cybersecurity and privacy laws, currency regulations, and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations; (3) the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; (4) uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws; (5) rapid changes in government policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and (6) currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations.Any failure by our international operations to comply with anti-corruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our growth, harm our reputation, or subject us to broader liability. We are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and anti-corruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations, such as the UK Bribery Act. Anti-corruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons to receive or retain business. These laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records. Due to the Starwood Combination, we now have more properties in countries outside of the U.S., including in many parts of the world where corruption is common, and our compliance with anti-corruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices. The compliance programs, internal controls and policies we and, prior to the Merger Date, Starwood, maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may not prevent our associates, contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations. We are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules. The U.S. may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business. Depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed, our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected. Any violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, reduce our profits, disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business, damage our reputation, or result in lawsuits being brought against the Company or its officers or directors. In addition, the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations, reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities, or cease operations in certain countries, that would otherwise support growth.In connection with the Starwood Combination, we are currently assessing various regulatory compliance matters at several foreign Legacy-Starwood locations, including compliance with the U.S. FCPA. The results of this assessment may give rise to contingencies that could require us to accrue expenses, the amounts of which we are not able to currently estimate.Exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results. We earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of U.S. dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the U.S. dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues. We are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our non-U.S. business are generally reported in local 12Table of Contentscurrency, which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates and the U.S. dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our non-U.S. operations increases. We enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees, but these efforts may not be successful. These hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business, do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover, and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk. Some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit. Some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. We may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees, which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows. Our new programs and new branded products may not be successful. We cannot assure you that recently launched or newly acquired brands, such as EDITION, AC Hotels by Marriott in the Americas, Protea Hotels, Moxy, Delta Hotels, and those we acquired as a result of the Starwood Combination, our recently announced investments in PlacePass and the joint venture with Alibaba, or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future, will be accepted by hotel owners, potential franchisees, or the traveling public or other guests. We also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products, or that those brands, programs, or products will be successful. In addition, some of our new or newly acquired brands involve or may involve cooperation and/or consultation with one or more third parties, including some shared control over product design and development, sales and marketing, and brand standards. Disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands and/or impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands. Risks relating to natural or man-made disasters, contagious disease, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our revenues. So called “Acts of God,” such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, such as 2017 hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, that caused severe damage in Houston, the Florida Keys, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and many other Caribbean islands, recent earthquakes, and man-made disasters in recent years as well as the potential spread of contagious diseases such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), Zika virus, and Ebola in locations where we own, manage, or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests, could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging. Actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest, or civil strife, such as recent events in Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, London, Manchester, Paris, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia, the Middle East, and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect. Any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them, both of which could adversely affect our profits. If a terrorist event were to involve one or more of our branded properties, demand for our hotels in particular could suffer, which could further hurt our revenues and profits.Disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives. Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own very few of our lodging properties. The nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements, which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product, service or systems initiatives, the timing and amount of capital investments, and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs. Such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker. We seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners, but we cannot always do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation, and could do so in the future. If any such litigation results in an adverse judgment, settlement, or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained.Our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands, and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations. Events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands. Many other factors also can influence our reputation and the value of our brands, including service, food quality and safety, availability and management of scarce natural resources, supply chain management, diversity, human rights, and support for local communities. Reputational value is also based on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands and our hotels, and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social 13Table of Contentsmedia publicity, governmental investigations or penalties, or litigation. Negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, lost sales, disruption of access to our websites and reservation systems, loss of development opportunities, or associate retention and recruiting difficulties. Any decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.If our brands, goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we had $18.0 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands, or changes in interest rates, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation. We franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging, timeshare, residential, and our credit card programs. Under the terms of their agreements with us, our franchisees and licensees interact directly with guests and other third parties under our brand and trade names. If these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience operational problems, including any data breach involving guest information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer. Although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee, including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances, it could be expensive or time consuming for us to pursue such remedies. We also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights.Collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. A significant number of associates at our managed, leased, and owned hotels (approximately 16 percent in the U.S. and approximately 13 percent worldwide) are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If relationships with those associates or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public demonstrations. Collective bargaining agreements representing approximately half of our organized associates in the U.S. are expiring in 2018 and are in the process of being renegotiated. Labor disputes, which are generally more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated, could harm our relationship with our associates, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests. Further, adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. We do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by our third-party property owners and franchisees. Increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.Damage to, or losses involving, properties that we own, manage, or franchise may not be covered by insurance, or the cost of such insurance could increase. Marriott requires comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed, leased, and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary. We require managed hotel owners to procure such coverage or we procure such coverage on their behalf. We also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain, or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, terrorist acts, or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems, may result in high deductibles, low limits, or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high. As a result, we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels, and we expect substantial increases in property insurance costs in 2018 and possibly future years due to the severe and widespread damage caused by the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated 14Table of Contentsfuture revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for guarantees, debt, or other financial obligations for the property.Development and Financing RisksWhile we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, our hotel owners depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels, and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary. Both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments, as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels. The availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors, over which we exert little control. Obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments. In addition, owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity.Our growth strategy depends upon third-party owners/operators, and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable. Our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners. The terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.Our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments. Our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised Marriott brands is affected, and may potentially be limited, by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally. These include site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals, and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors, such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements, costs of construction, and anticipated room rate structure.Our development activities expose us to project cost, completion, and resale risks. We occasionally develop new hotel and residential properties, both directly and through partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures with third parties. As demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2014 and 2015 in connection with our development and construction of three EDITION hotels and residences, our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks, including that: (1) continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability, or that of third parties with whom we do business, to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties; (2) properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate, potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges; (3) construction delays or cost overruns, including those due to a shortage of skilled labor, lender financial defaults, or so called “Acts of God” such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations; and (4) we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion.Our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks. Although we had relatively few owned and leased properties at the end of 2017, we acquired a significant number of those properties as part of the Starwood Combination, and such properties are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property. Although we have sold several of those properties since the Merger Date and we are actively pursuing additional sales, equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly, and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all. Moreover, the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties, and the expenses incurred. A variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and/or time-consuming to develop real property or expand, modify, or renovate hotels. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding, or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property. Finally, under eminent domain laws, governments can take real property, sometimes for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Despite our asset-light strategy, our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. If our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, including needed capital expenditures, our income could be adversely affected. 15Table of ContentsDevelopment activities that involve our co-investment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs, impair project operations, or increase project completion risks. Partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties which we have entered into or acquired as part of the Starwood Combination generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies, or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. Actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay, increased project costs, or operational difficulties following project completion. Such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments.Investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk. In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, Starwood, and to a lesser extent Marriott, has from time to time invested, and we may continue to invest, as a co-venturer. Such arrangements often have shared control over the operation of the assets. Therefore, such investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-venturer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations. Should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of the venture’s liabilities. Also, our venture partner could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals, take action contrary to our instructions, or make requests contrary to our policies or objectives. Further, we may be unable to act without the approval of our venture partners and, alternatively, our venture partners could take actions binding on the venture or partnership without our consent. Therefore, actions by a co-venturer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk. We cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful despite these risks.Risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits. We participate, through licensing agreements or directly or through noncontrolling interests, in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands, including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks. Such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business, which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity, including risks that (1) weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands; (2) increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally, or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay; and (3) residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits, and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant.Some hotel openings in our development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. We report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline, including hotels under construction and under signed contracts, as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under contract. The eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and, in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract, is subject to numerous risks, including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system, or that those hotels will open when we anticipate.If we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties, our profits could decline. At times, we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements. From time to time we also provide third-party lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise, generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings. We could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded.If owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties, our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed. The owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced. If those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, the lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt, and repossess the property. Such sales or repossessions could, in some cases, result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 16Table of ContentsTechnology, Information Protection, and Privacy RisksA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position. The lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our reservation, revenue management, property management, human resources and payroll systems, our Loyalty Programs, and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated, and/or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis, and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.An increase in the use of third-party Internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business. Some of our hotel rooms are booked through Internet travel intermediaries such as Expedia.com®, Priceline.com®, Booking.com™, Travelocity.com®, and Orbitz.com®, as well as lesser-known online travel service providers. These intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel, but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings. Although our Best Rate Guarantee programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels, intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests, including the purchase, by certain companies, of trademarked online keywords such as “Marriott” from Internet search engines such as Google®, Bing®, Yahoo®, and Baidu® to steer guests toward their websites (a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court). Although we have successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries, the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely. Our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services, diverting bookings away from our direct online channels, or through their fees, increase the overall cost of Internet bookings for our hotels. In addition, if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements as our contracts with intermediaries come up for periodic renewal, our hotels might no longer appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result.We are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company employee and guest data. Our businesses process, use, and transmit large volumes of employee and guest data, including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties, including our owners, franchisees and licensees, as well as our service providers, in areas such as human resources outsourcing, website hosting, and various forms of electronic communications. The integrity and protection of that guest, employee, and company data is critical to our business. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we could make faulty decisions. Our guests and employees also have a high expectation that we, as well as our owners, franchisees, licensees, and service providers, will adequately protect their personal information. The information, security, and privacy requirements imposed by laws and governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding, in the U.S., the European Union, Asia, and other jurisdictions where we operate. Our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners, franchisees, licensees, and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and employee and guest expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, “ransomware” or other malware, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our information systems and records and those of our owners, franchisees, licensees, or service providers. Our reliance on computer, Internet-based and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. Breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our owners, franchisees, licensees, or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. In addition, although we carry cyber/privacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks, that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other related breaches. Furthermore, in the future such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.Changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs, increase our exposure to fines and litigation, and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively. We are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information, including in the European Union, Asia, and other jurisdictions. Non-U.S. data privacy and data security laws, various U.S. federal and state laws, credit card industry security standards, and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us. Compliance with changes in applicable data privacy 17Table of Contentslaws and regulations and contractual obligations may increase our operating costs, increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged non-compliance, and adversely affect our reputation.Additionally, we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing, online advertising, and postal mailings. Any further restrictions in laws such as the CANSPAM Act, and various U.S. state laws, or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy, e-privacy, and anti-spam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, online advertising, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products. We also obtain access to potential guests from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships, and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials. If access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new guests and introduce them to our products could be impaired.Any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems, as part of our integration of Starwood or otherwise, could adversely affect our performance and results. We manage global reservation systems that communicate reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online, through our mobile apps, through our telephone call centers, or through intermediaries like travel agents, Internet travel websites, and other distribution channels. The cost, speed, accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands. Our business may suffer if we fail to maintain, upgrade, or prevent disruption to our reservation systems. In addition, the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation systems could increase with the anticipated systems integration that is part of our integration of Starwood. Disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data.Other RisksChanges in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs. We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, and policies in jurisdictions around the world, including those for financial reporting, taxes, healthcare, cybersecurity, privacy, climate change, and the environment. Changes to these laws, regulations, or policies, including those associated with health care, tax or financial reforms, climate change and the environment, could reduce our profits. We also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures, and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions, costs, or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits. In particular, governments may revise tax laws, regulations, or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us, and other modifications could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our operations or could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), which significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the 2017 Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require preparation and analysis of information not previously required or regularly produced. In addition, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in future periods. Accordingly, while we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the 2017 Tax Act in our Financial Statements, further regulatory or GAAP accounting guidance for the 2017 Tax Act, our further analysis on the application of the law, and refinement of our initial estimates and calculations could materially change our current provisional estimates, which could in turn materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.If we cannot attract and retain talented associates, our business could suffer. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop, and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses. A shortage of skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs, which could reduce our profits.Delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our Board of Directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts. Under the Delaware business combination statute, a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without Board of Director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, 18Table of Contentsamong other things, require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our Board of Directors could, without shareholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a shareholder rights plan.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.Item 2.Properties. We describe our company-operated properties in Part I, Item 1. “Business” earlier in this report, and under the “Properties and Rooms” caption in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We believe our owned and leased properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements. Most of our regional offices, reservation centers, and sales offices, as well as our corporate headquarters, are in leased facilities, both domestically and internationally.As of December 31, 2017, we owned or leased the following hotel properties:Properties Location RoomsNorth American Full-Service Owned Hotels The St. Regis, New York New York, NY 238The Westin Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta Atlanta, GA 1,073The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile Chicago, IL 135Le Centre Sheraton Montreal Hotel Montreal, Canada 825Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto International Airport Mississauga, Canada 474Las Vegas Marriott Las Vegas, NV 278Leased Hotels W New York – Times Square New York, NY 509Renaissance New York Times Square Hotel New York, NY 317Anaheim Marriott Anaheim, CA 1,030Kaua’i Marriott Resort Lihue, HI 356 North American Limited-Service Owned Hotels Courtyard Las Vegas Convention Center Las Vegas, NV 149Residence Inn Las Vegas Convention Center Las Vegas, NV 192Leased Hotels Albuquerque Airport Courtyard Albuquerque, NM 150Baltimore BWI Airport Courtyard Linthicum, MD 149Baton Rouge Acadian Centre/LSU Area Courtyard Baton Rouge, LA 149Chicago O'Hare Courtyard Des Plaines, IL 180Des Moines West/Clive Courtyard Clive, IA 108Fort Worth University Drive Courtyard Fort Worth, TX 130Greensboro Courtyard Greensboro, NC 149Indianapolis Airport Courtyard Indianapolis, IN 151Irvine John Wayne Airport/Orange County Courtyard Irvine, CA 153Louisville East Courtyard Louisville, KY 151Mt.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverviewWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties in 127 countries and territories under 30 brand names. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and Asia Pacific. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Caribbean and Latin America operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments.We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. In most markets, base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue, or certain property-level revenue in the case of franchise fees, while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return. In the Middle East and Asia, incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves.Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). Our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Loyalty Programs, multichannel reservation systems, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements.Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Managed properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. 24Table of ContentsPerformance Measures We believe RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.Our RevPAR statistics for 2017, 2016, and 2015, include Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for each of the full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Merger Date. Therefore, our RevPAR statistics include Legacy-Starwood properties for periods during which fees from the Legacy-Starwood properties are not included in our Income Statements. We provide these RevPAR statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the Starwood Combination, that were open and operating under one of our Legacy-Marriott or Legacy-Starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2016 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. For 2017 compared to 2016, we had 3,883 comparable North American properties and 1,030 comparable International properties. For 2016 compared to 2015, we had 3,698 comparable North American properties (including 483 Legacy-Starwood properties) and 965 comparable International properties (including 506 Legacy-Starwood properties).We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Business Trends Our 2017 full-year results reflected a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system, including those from the Starwood Combination, favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world, and slow but steady economic growth. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2017 increased 3.1 percent to $115.02, ADR increased 1.2 percent on a constant dollar basis to $157.12, and occupancy increased 1.4 percentage points to 73.2 percent, compared to 2016.In North America, RevPAR increased in 2017, partially driven by higher demand in Washington, D.C., growth in transient leisure business, and favorable citywide events and group business in the fourth quarter. RevPAR was somewhat enhanced by increased demand in impacted areas following the September hurricanes in Florida and Texas. RevPAR growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply and only moderate GDP growth. In our Asia Pacific segment in 2017, RevPAR growth was strong in Greater China, reflecting improved performance in key markets, as well as in India and Thailand. Our Europe region experienced higher demand in 2017, led by strong transient business in most countries. In our Middle East and Africa region, demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability, political sanctions on Qatar, and lower oil prices, offset by favorable results in South Africa. Growth in the Caribbean and Latin America regions reflected strength in Mexico and improving leisure demand in the Caribbean, but was partially constrained by weak, but improving, economic conditions in many markets in South America. Nine managed and franchised Caribbean hotels remained closed at year-end 2017 due to significant damage from hurricanes in the region, and we anticipate that two to four of these properties will resume operations in 2018.We monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. Our hotels modify the mix of business to improve 25Table of Contentsrevenue as demand changes. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.In 2017 compared to 2016 at comparable properties, worldwide company-operated house profit margins increased by 80 basis points and worldwide company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 5.4 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher RevPAR, improved productivity, and procurement and synergy savings. North American company-operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points, and HP-PAR increased by 2.8 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 130 basis points, and HP-PAR increased by 8.9 percent. In the 2017 fourth quarter, we reached new multi-year agreements to amend our relationships with JP Morgan Chase and American Express for our U.S.-issued, co-brand credit cards associated with our Loyalty Programs. We expect that these agreements will have a favorable impact on our total revenues beginning in 2018.System Growth and PipelineIn 2017, we added 473 properties with 76,589 rooms. Approximately 39 percent of the added rooms are located outside North America, and 14 percent are conversions from competitor brands. In 2017, 69 properties (12,952 rooms) exited our system. Our global pipeline grew to a record 460,000 rooms at year-end 2017, with over half located outside of North America. The pipeline includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, and nearly 34,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. In 2017, we signed more than 750 management and franchise agreements for new hotels, representing nearly 125,000 rooms. Of those room signings, nearly 80 percent were in the industry’s three highest-quality tiers -- luxury, upper upscale, and upscale -- which drive significant revenue per available room and fee revenue. Contracts signed in 2017 also reflected the growing demand for select service hotels worldwide, with a record 578 contracts signed for our classic select and distinctive select brands, of which 420 are for hotels in North America and 158 are for hotels located outside of North America. In 2018, we expect the number of our open hotel rooms will increase approximately 7 percent gross, while room exits will total 1 to 1.5 percent.Properties and RoomsAt year-end 2017, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties and rooms: Managed Franchised/Licensed Owned/Leased Other (1) Total Properties Rooms Properties Rooms Properties Rooms Properties Rooms Properties RoomsNorth American Full-Service423 187,814 670 195,196 10 5,235 — — 1,103 388,245North American Limited-Service404 63,807 3,211 369,347 20 3,006 31 5,288 3,666 441,448Asia Pacific545 163,437 92 25,802 4 953 — — 641 190,192Other International520 121,315 370 72,866 33 9,075 98 12,371 1,021 215,627 Timeshare— — 89 22,154 — — — — 89 22,154Total1,892 536,373 4,432 685,365 67 18,269 129 17,659 6,520 1,257,666(1) Other represents unconsolidated equity method investments, which we present in the “Equity in earnings” caption of our Income Statements. 26Table of ContentsSegment and Brand StatisticsThe following brand statistics present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR for comparable properties 2017, 2017 compared to 2016, 2016, and 2016 compared to 2015, including Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for the full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Starwood Combination.

In accordance with GAAP, our Income Statements include Legacy-Starwood’s results of operations from the Merger Date. All references to the effect of Legacy-Starwood operations on our 2017 results refer to the incremental amounts contributed by Legacy-Starwood operations in 2017 over the effect of Legacy-Starwood operations on our results for the period from the Merger Date through December 31, 2016. All references to the effect of the Starwood Combination on our 2016 results refer to the amounts contributed by Legacy-Starwood operations from the Merger Date through December 31, 2016.Our 2017 results were favorably impacted by the non-recurring gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in Avendra, discussed in Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions.” We committed to the owners of the hotels in our system that the benefits derived from Avendra, including any dividends or sale proceeds above our original investment, would be used for the benefit of the hotels in our system. Accordingly, we intend to utilize the net proceeds for the benefit of our system of hotels and are currently developing those plans. Spending under those plans will be expensed in our Income Statements and reduce our profitability in future periods.

In North America, we earned incentive management fees from 60 percent of our managed properties. Outside North America, we earned incentive management fees from 80 percent of our managed properties, representing 62 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2017 from managed properties. 2016 Compared to 2015The $108 million increase in base management fees was driven by $103 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: the impact of stronger sales at existing properties ($22 million) and unit growth across our system ($15 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), lower deferred fee recognition ($11 million), and lower fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million).The $185 million increase in franchise fees was driven by $98 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: the impact of unit growth across our system ($48 million), higher branding fees ($39 million), stronger sales at existing properties ($16 million), and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($11 million), partially offset by lower relicensing fees ($22 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $106 million increase in incentive management fees was driven by $72 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: higher net house profit and unit growth, higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios ($10 million), and higher deferred fee recognition ($8 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). In 2016, 69 percent of our Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 68 percent in 2015. In North America, 65 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees in 2016 compared to 63 percent in 2015. Outside North America, 74 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees in both 2016 and 2015, representing 48 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2016 from Legacy-Marriott managed properties compared to 51 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2015.

For more information, see Footnote 4 “Merger-Related Costs and Charges.”2016 Compared to 2015Depreciation, amortization, and other expenses increased by $29 million driven by $43 million from the Starwood Combination, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million from Legacy-Marriott operations which primarily reflected a favorable variance to 2015 impairment charges.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $70 million, primarily due to $79 million from the Starwood Combination, partially offset by a net decrease of $9 million in Legacy-Marriott expenses. The decrease primarily reflected $15 million in lower reserves for guarantee funding and $9 million in lower foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher administrative costs to grow our brands globally, $4 million of higher bad debt reserves, and $3 million net unfavorable impact to our legal expenses associated with 2015 litigation resolutions.Merger-related costs and charges increased by $386 million.

See the “Dispositions” caption of Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Interest expense increased by $54 million, primarily due to an increase in debt as a result of the Starwood Combination and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $18 million of lower interest due to the maturities of Series H and I Notes and a $13 million favorable variance to the bridge term loan facility commitment costs that we incurred in 2016. Interest income increased by $3 million, primarily due to issuances of new loans, partially offset by $7 million lower interest income on a repaid loan.Equity in earnings increased by $29 million, primarily due to higher earnings by Legacy-Starwood investees.2016 Compared to 2015Gains and other income, net decreased by $22 million, primarily due to the net Legacy-Marriott gain that we recorded in 2015.Interest expense increased by $67 million, primarily due to a net increase in Senior Notes interest expense ($18 million), an increase in debt as a result of the Starwood Combination ($15 million), the amortization of costs for a bridge term loan facility commitment that we obtained in the 2016 first quarter ($13 million), net lower capitalized interest primarily due to the completion of The New York (Madison Square Park) EDITION in 2015 ($9 million), and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings ($7 million). Interest income increased by $6 million, primarily driven by higher Legacy-Marriott interest income on a loan that we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a North American Limited-Service property in the 2015 fourth quarter ($8 million), partially offset by lower Legacy-Marriott interest income on two repaid loans ($6 million).Equity in earnings decreased by $6 million, primarily reflecting a net unfavorable variance to three Legacy-Marriott adjustments recorded in 2015, partially offset by $5 million from the Starwood Combination. Income TaxesOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that differs from our interpretation. See Footnote 7 “Income Taxes” for further information on the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our 2017 results. As discussed below and in Footnote 7 “Income Taxes,” our accounting for the 2017 Tax Act is not yet complete as we continue to refine our calculations, collect necessary information, and monitor developing interpretations. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional regulatory or accounting guidance, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts we have recorded during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act that could materially impact our provision for income taxes in the periods in which we make such adjustments. Although we are not yet able to quantify all impacts of the 2017 Tax Act on our 2018 and future results, we believe that the overall impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our future financial results will be positive. We discuss the provisional impact on our 2017 results and the potential impact on our future results further in the paragraphs below. 33Table of ContentsReduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, we recorded a provisional estimated net tax benefit of $159 million from remeasurement of our year-end deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower rate at which we expect they will be realized in the future. While we have made a reasonable estimate of the impact of the corporate tax rate reduction, that estimate could change as we complete our analyses of all impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, including, but not limited to, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax. The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (“Transition Tax”) is a new tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits (“E&P”) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated post-1986 through year-end 2017. In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, deemed repatriation of such E&P under the 2017 Tax Act may result in additional state income taxes in some of the U.S. states in which we operate. We recorded a provisional estimated Transition Tax expense of $745 million in 2017. We are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax, and our estimate could change when we finalize all necessary calculations. We estimate that cash payments for the Transition Tax will total $600 million, which is lower than our provisional estimated Transition Tax expense due to our ability to utilize tax credits that we have carried over from prior years and other adjustments. The federal portion of the Transition Tax is payable over eight years, and we estimate that we will pay $578 million as follows: 8 percent in each of the years from 2018 to 2022, 15 percent in 2023, 20 percent in 2024, and 25 percent in 2025. Our estimate includes payment of an additional $22 million in state income taxes in 2018 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. These amounts could change when we finalize our analysis of the taxability of the E&P in the states in which we operate.State net operating losses and valuation allowances. We must assess whether various aspects of the 2017 Tax Act affect our state net operating loss valuation allowances. As discussed above, we have recorded provisional estimates of state income taxes for certain portions of the 2017 Tax Act, but we have not completed our analysis for the states where we have net operating loss carryovers and valuation allowances. Because we have not yet completed our determination of the need for, or any change in, any valuation allowance, we have not recorded any change to our valuation allowances as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.Other provisions. We continue to evaluate other provisions in the 2017 Tax Act, including: (1) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), a new minimum tax; (2) elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”); (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (5) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability. Because we have not yet completed our analysis of these provisions, we do not have a reasonable estimate of their potential impact, if any, on our future results.The impact of the 2017 Tax Act, and other changes affecting our provision for income taxes, are discussed below.($ in millions)2017 2016 2015 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015Provision for income taxes$(1,464) $(404) $(396) $1,060 262% $8 2%2017 Compared to 2016Provision for income taxes increased by $1,060 million, primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act ($586 million), the gain on the sale of our interest in Avendra ($259 million), higher earnings due to the inclusion of Legacy-Starwood operations for the full year 2017 ($244 million), lower merger-related costs ($86 million), an unfavorable comparison to the 2016 release of a valuation allowance ($15 million), the gain on the disposition of a North American Full-Service property ($9 million), and a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign jurisdictions ($7 million). The increase was partially offset by tax benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 ($72 million), tax law changes in non-U.S. jurisdictions ($22 million), change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings ($26 million), the reversal of tax reserves related to interest accrued for previous periods ($15 million), and adjustments resulting from finalizing prior years’ returns ($10 million).2016 Compared to 2015Provision for income taxes increased by $8 million, driven by $4 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: tax rate changes in several jurisdictions ($12 million), higher earnings from foreign operations ($6 million), and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 U.S. and foreign true-ups ($5 million), partially offset by lower U.S. earnings due to merger-related expenses ($11 million) and the release of a valuation allowance ($8 million). 34Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of the results of operations of our reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and Asia Pacific. In the 2017 first quarter, our Asia Pacific operating segment met the applicable accounting criteria to be a reportable segment. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Caribbean and Latin America operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments, and accordingly we have not included those operations in this discussion of our Business Segments. See Footnote 18 “Business Segments” to our Financial Statements for other information about each segment, including revenues and a reconciliation of segment profits to net income. Our 2016 results in this section do not include any Legacy-Starwood results for the period between the Merger Date and the end of the 2016 third quarter, as we did not allocate any Legacy-Starwood results to our segments for the eight days ended September 30, 2016.

North American Full-Service segment profits increased by $405 million, primarily due to the following:•$305 million of higher base management and franchise fees, primarily reflecting $297 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees, $14 million from Legacy-Marriott unit growth, and $8 million of stronger RevPAR at Legacy-Marriott hotels, partially offset by $17 million of lower Legacy-Marriott residential branding fees;•$45 million of higher incentive management fees, primarily driven by $31 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees and higher net house profits at Legacy-Marriott managed hotels;•$61 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting $63 million of higher Legacy-Starwood owned and leased profits;•$44 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expenses, primarily reflecting higher depreciation and amortization on Legacy-Starwood assets; •$22 million of higher gains and other income, net, primarily due to the gain on the sale of a North American Full-Service hotel in the 2017 second quarter; and•$16 million of higher equity in earnings, primarily due to higher earnings by Legacy-Starwood investees.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $12,391 million in 2017, compared to $9,126 million in 2016.2016 Compared to 2015In 2016, across our North American Full-Service segment we added 424 properties (154,521 rooms), including 398 properties (147,623 rooms) from the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date, and two properties (213 rooms) left our system. North American Full-Service segment profits increased by $216 million, reflecting $110 million from the Starwood Combination and $106 million of higher Legacy-Marriott profits, primarily due to the following:•$58 million of higher Legacy-Marriott base management and franchise fees, primarily reflecting $30 million of stronger RevPAR and unit growth and $21 million of higher branding fees;•$17 million of higher Legacy-Marriott incentive management fees, primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels;

(2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our common stock; (3) stock options to purchase our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We also issue performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) to named executive officers and some of their direct reports. See Footnote 6 “Share-Based Compensation” for more information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit Facility We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for up to $4,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings to support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. While any outstanding commercial paper borrowings and/or borrowings under our Credit Facility generally have short-term maturities, we classify the outstanding borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on June 10, 2021. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.We issue commercial paper in the U.S. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year-end 2017, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2,010 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,627 million under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $383 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $4,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $2,373 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility). We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs, primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of Senior Notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly. 38Table of ContentsCash from OperationsCash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2017 2016 2015Cash from operations$2,436 $1,682 $1,515Non-cash items (1)1,299 456 395(1) Includes depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2017 and 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2016. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in Exhibit 12 to this 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are as follows:Fiscal Years2017 2016 2015 2014 20138.8x 5.1x 6.4x 6.2x 5.1xFor 2018, we plan to invest in our workforce by offering an additional one-time contribution to our retirement savings plans. Structured as a $5-to-$1 company match of up to $1,000, we expect the vast majority of participating associates would receive this incremental company contribution. This contribution will be available to eligible associates at company-operated hotels, as well as those in corporate and regional offices, in the U.S. We also expect to invest in global associate support programs. We estimate an overall cost of $140 million for these investments in our workforce, with approximately $70 million of that amount coming from proceeds from the 2017 sale of our interest in Avendra.Investing Activities Cash FlowsAcquisition of a Business, Net of Cash Acquired. Cash outflows of $2,412 million in 2016 were due to the Starwood Combination. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $240 million in 2017, $199 million in 2016, and $305 million in 2015. Capital expenditures in 2017 increased by $41 million compared to 2016, primarily due to improvements to our worldwide systems and improvements to hotels acquired in the Starwood Combination. Capital expenditures in 2016 decreased by $106 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower spending for our EDITION hotels.We expect 2018 investment spending will total approximately $600 million to $700 million, including approximately $225 million for maintenance capital spending. Consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. In the Starwood Combination, we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels, many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell. We also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include new construction, loans, guarantees, and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $1,418 million cash proceeds in 2017 and $218 million in 2016. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $94 million in 2017, compared to net collections of $35 million in 2016. At year-end 2017, we had $149 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans outstanding, compared to $248 million outstanding at year-end 2016. 39Table of ContentsEquity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $63 million in 2017, $14 million in 2016, and $7 million in 2015 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflect our investments in several joint ventures.Financing Activities Cash FlowsDebt. Debt decreased by $268 million in 2017, to $8,238 million at year-end 2017 from $8,506 million at year-end 2016, primarily due to $293 million in Series I Notes that matured in the 2017 second quarter, partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. See Footnote 11 “Long-Term Debt” for additional information on the debt issuances.Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2017, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 2.9 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.0 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2017.See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facility,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases. We purchased 29.2 million shares of our common stock in 2017 at an average price of $103.66 per share, 8.0 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $71.55 per share, and 25.7 million shares in 2015 at an average price of $75.48 per share. At year-end 2017, 32.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under Board approved authorizations. For additional information, see “Fourth Quarter 2017 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2017: (1) $0.30 per share declared on February 10, 2017 and paid March 31, 2017 to shareholders of record on February 24, 2017, (2) $0.33 per share declared on May 5, 2017 and paid June 30, 2017 to shareholders of record on May 19, 2017, (3) $0.33 per share declared on August 10, 2017 and paid September 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 24, 2017, and (4) $0.33 per share declared on November 9, 2017 and paid December 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on November 22, 2017.

In addition, the table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2017 of $448 million. See Footnote 7 “Income Taxes” for additional information.In addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 40Table of ContentsOther CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our guarantee, investment, and loan commitments at year-end 2017: ($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsGuarantee commitments (expiration by period)$377 $20 $149 $100 $108Investment and loan commitments (expected funding by period)60 50 5 3 2Total other commitments$437 $70 $154 $103 $110In conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner. For further information, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments” caption in Footnote 8 “Commitments and Contingencies.”Letters of CreditAt year-end 2017, we had $162 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the Credit Facility, as defined in Footnote 11 “Long-Term Debt”), most of which were for our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2017 totaled $155 million, most of which state governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSEquity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management services and receive fees. We also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.Other Related PartiesWe provide management services for and receive fees from properties owned by JWM Family Enterprises, L.P., which is beneficially owned and controlled by J.W. Marriott, Jr., Deborah Marriott Harrison, and other members of the Marriott family.For more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote 19 “Related Party Transactions.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.See Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further information related our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Loyalty Programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill; 41Table of ContentsIntangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;Loan Loss Reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well our provisional estimates of the current year impacts of the 2017 Tax Act; andBusiness Combinations, including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates, royalty rates, and the amount and timing of future cash flows.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available-for-sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for year-end 2019 compared to year-end 2018 can be found in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverviewWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties in 133 countries and territories under 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We discuss our operations in the following three reportable business segments: U.S. & Canada; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). Our Caribbean and Latin America (“CALA”) operating segment does not meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and we include its results in “Unallocated corporate and other.” In January 2021, we modified our reportable segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the Company. Beginning with the 2021 first quarter, we will report the following two operating segments: U.S. & Canada and International.25Table of Contents We earn base management fees and, under many agreements, incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. In most markets, base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue, or certain property-level revenue in the case of franchise fees, while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return. For our hotels in the Middle East and Africa and in the Asia Pacific region, incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (also referred to as “house profit”) less non-controllable expenses such as property insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves. Additionally, we earn franchise fees for use of our intellectual property, including fees from our co-brand credit card, timeshare, and residential programs.Starwood Data Security IncidentOn November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the “Data Security Incident”). The Starwood reservations database is no longer used for business operations.In July 2019, the ICO issued a formal notice of intent under the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 (the “U.K. DPA”) proposing a fine in the amount of £99 million against the Company in relation to the Data Security Incident. In October 2020, the ICO issued a final decision under the U.K. DPA, which includes a fine of £18.4 million. The Company did not appeal the ICO’s decision, but has made no admission of liability in relation to the decision or the underlying allegations. In 2019, we expensed $65 million for this loss contingency, in the “Restructuring and merger-related charges” caption of our Income Statements, based on the fine initially proposed by the ICO in July 2019 and the ongoing proceeding. In 2020, we recorded a $39 million reversal of expense, based on the ICO’s issuance of the final decision. We paid a portion of the ICO fine in the 2020 fourth quarter, and the remainder is payable over the next two years. Our accrual for this loss contingency, which we present in the “Accrued expenses and other” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” captions of our Balance Sheets, was $65 million at year-end 2019 and $17 million at year-end 2020. See Note 8 for additional information.We are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already incurred. However, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. Although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Security Incident, that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses (including fines and penalties) related to the Data Security Incident. As we expected, the cost of such insurance again increased for our current policy period, and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase for future policy periods. We expect to incur significant expenses associated with the Data Security Incident in future periods, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations (including possible additional fines and penalties), increased expenses and capital investments for information technology and information security and data privacy, and increased expenses for compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. See Note 8 for additional information related to expenses incurred in 2020 and 2019, insurance recoveries, and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Data Security Incident. Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available (including rooms in hotels temporarily closed due to issues related to COVID-19), measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. Comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2019 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, with the exception of properties closed or otherwise experiencing interruptions related to COVID-19, which we continue to classify as comparable. For 2020 compared to 2019, we had 4,641 comparable U.S. & Canada properties and 1,340 comparable International properties. 26Table of Contents Impact of COVID-19COVID-19 continues to have a material impact on our business, our Company, and our industry. COVID-19 first impacted our business in Greater China beginning in January 2020, moved quickly into the rest of Asia Pacific and the European markets, and spread globally by March 2020. As the pandemic accelerated around the world, worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR fell sharply. Global occupancy levels and RevPAR have since improved compared to the extremely low levels reached in April 2020, but the pace of recovery generally slowed in most regions in the 2020 fourth quarter and into January 2021 due to the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. As a result, our fee revenue and revenue from owned and leased properties declined significantly during 2020, and we expect that there will not be a significant rebound in travel and lodging demand until there is widespread distribution of effective vaccines. Worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR declined 23 percent in the 2020 first quarter, 84 percent in the 2020 second quarter, 66 percent in the 2020 third quarter, and 64 percent in the 2020 fourth quarter, compared to the same periods in 2019. Worldwide, approximately six percent of our hotels were closed as of February 15, 2021, compared to the peak of more than 25 percent closed on April 26, 2020. However, the progress of recovery is uneven. The spread of COVID-19 has constrained and continues to constrain the speed of recovery and will continue to have a dampening impact on demand. Demand is still being primarily driven by leisure travelers, and we have not seen meaningful demand return from business and group travelers.Of our geographic regions, Greater China experienced the greatest improvement in demand compared to the 2020 second quarter, driven initially by domestic leisure travel with business transient and group business improving through the year, while demand in the rest of Asia Pacific has generally improved at a much slower pace. In our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, leisure demand drove RevPAR improvements in the 2020 third quarter compared to the 2020 second quarter, though increases in COVID-19 cases in Europe and resulting increases in government restrictions began anew in September 2020, which negatively impacted the recovery in the 2020 fourth quarter. In U.S. & Canada, demand improved during the remainder of 2020 from the lows seen in April 2020, primarily driven by leisure travel and by travelers within driving range of their destinations. We continue to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts for our hotel owners and our own business. Business contingency plans have been implemented around the world, and we continue to adjust these in response to the global situation. At the corporate level, our actions to date have substantially reduced the monthly run rate of corporate general and administrative costs compared to the monthly costs initially budgeted for 2020, excluding our provision for credit losses. We reduced spending on capital expenditures and other investments, and as previously announced, we suspended share repurchases and cash dividends.We have taken a number of steps to reorganize the Company in response to the decline in lodging demand caused by COVID-19. We implemented temporary furloughs and reduced work week schedules for both above-property and on-property associates, most of which ended in September 2020 for above-property associates. As part of the realignment of our organization, we implemented a voluntary transition program for certain associates, and we eliminated a significant number of positions. While we have substantially completed the programs related to our above-property organization, we are continuing to develop restructuring plans, which could result in additional on-property position eliminations, to achieve cost savings specific to each of our company-operated properties. See Note 3 for more information about our restructuring activities. At the property level, we continue to work with owners and franchisees to lower their cash outlays. The steps we have taken to date include deferring renovations, certain hotel initiatives and brand standard audits for hotel owners and franchisees; reducing the amount of certain charges for systemwide programs and services; offering a delay in payment terms for certain charges in the 2020 second quarter; supporting owners and franchisees who are working with their lenders to utilize furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) reserves to meet working capital needs; and waiving required FF&E funding through 2021. We have significantly lowered the reimbursed expenses we incur on behalf of our owners and franchisees to provide centralized programs and services such as the Loyalty Program, reservations, marketing and sales, which we generally collect through cost reimbursement revenue on the basis of hotel revenue or program usage. In 2020, we applied for Employee Retention Tax Credit refunds from the U.S. Treasury under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) totaling $164 million. In the 2020 fourth quarter, we received $119 million, $94 million of which we passed through to the related hotels that we manage on behalf of owners. We expect to receive the remaining refund in 2021, the majority of which we expect will inure to the benefit of our hotel owners. We continue to evaluate the availability of credits and benefits under the CARES Act and other legislation.The impact of COVID-19 on the Company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, and we expect to continue to assess and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations and plans as we continue to evaluate the implications of COVID-19 on our business. The overall operational and financial impact is highly dependent on 27Table of Contents the breadth and duration of COVID-19, including the availability and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments, and could be affected by other factors we are not currently able to predict.System Growth and PipelineIn 2020, our system grew from 7,349 properties (1,380,921 rooms) at year-end 2019 to 7,642 properties (1,423,044 rooms) at year-end 2020, reflecting the addition of 399 properties (62,776 rooms) and the exit of 106 properties (20,416 rooms). Approximately 45 percent of added rooms are located outside U.S. & Canada, and 13 percent are conversions from competitor brands. At year-end 2020, we had more than 498,000 rooms in our development pipeline, which includes hotel rooms under construction, hotel rooms under signed contracts, and roughly 20,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. Over 229,000 rooms in our development pipeline were under construction at year-end 2020. Over half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside U.S. & Canada. In 2020, we signed management and franchise agreements for 1,575 properties (248,660 rooms).In 2021, we expect gross rooms growth of approximately 6.0 percent (3.0 to 3.5 percent, net of deletions).Properties and RoomsAt year-end 2020, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties and rooms: ManagedFranchised/LicensedOwned/LeasedTotalPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsU.S. & Canada788 240,487 4,720 677,120 26 6,483 5,534 924,090 Asia Pacific698 199,040 143 37,597 2 407 843 237,044 EMEA485 108,185 407 72,827 24 5,561 916 186,573 CALA112 21,520 132 27,613 14 3,449 258 52,582 Timeshare— — 91 22,755 — — 91 22,755 Total2,083 569,232 5,493 837,912 66 15,900 7,642 1,423,044 28Table of Contents Lodging StatisticsThe following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics for comparable properties for 2020 and 2020 compared to 2019.

The decrease in franchise fees was partially offset by unit growth ($37 million). The decrease in incentive management fees was primarily due to COVID-19. In 2020, we earned incentive management fees from 37 percent of our managed properties worldwide, compared to 72 percent in 2019. We earned incentive management fees from 3 percent of managed properties in U.S. & Canada and 56 percent of managed properties outside U.S. & Canada in 2020, compared to 57 percent in U.S. & Canada and 81 percent outside U.S. & Canada in 2019. In addition, 92 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2020 came from our managed properties outside U.S. & Canada, primarily in Asia Pacific, versus 65 percent in 2019.29Table of Contents Contract investment amortization increased primarily due to higher impairments of investments in management and franchise contracts, primarily due to COVID-19.Owned, Leased, and Other($ in millions)20202019Change 2020 vs. 2019Owned, leased, and other revenue$568 $1,612 $(1,044)(65)%Owned, leased, and other - direct expenses677 1,316 (639)(49)%Owned, leased, and other, net$(109)$296 $(405)(137)%Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses decreased primarily due to lower demand at and the temporary closure of certain of our owned and leased hotels due to COVID-19, as well as net lower owned and leased profits attributable to hotels sold in the 2019 fourth and 2020 first quarters ($19 million).Cost Reimbursements($ in millions)20202019Change 2020 vs. 2019Cost reimbursement revenue$8,452 $15,599 $(7,147)(46)%Reimbursed expenses8,435 16,439 (8,004)(49)%Cost reimbursements, net$17 $(840)$857 102 %Cost reimbursements, net (cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses) varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees, primarily driven by our Loyalty Program.

At year-end 2020, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.7 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 6.0 years. Including the effect of interest rate swaps, the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2020.In response to the negative impact COVID-19 had on our cash from operations in 2020, which we expect to continue to be negatively impacted as discussed above, we have taken numerous actions to preserve our financial flexibility and manage our debt maturities, which include:•Substantially reducing our corporate general and administrative costs, reimbursed expenses we incur on behalf of our owners and franchisees, and our capital expenditures and other investment spending, and implementing restructuring plans, as we discuss under the “Impact of COVID-19” section above;•Suspending share repurchases and dividends until conditions improve and until permitted under our Credit Facility; •Drawing under the Credit Facility, as we discuss under the “Sources of Liquidity-Our Credit Facility” section below;•Amending the Credit Facility to, among other things, waive the quarterly-tested leverage covenant in the Credit Facility through and including the fourth quarter of 2021, as we discuss under the “Sources of Liquidity-Our Credit Facility” section below;•Issuing $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and repurchasing and retiring approximately $853 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding senior notes maturing in 2022, which we discuss under the “Sources of Liquidity - Senior Notes Issuances and Repurchases” section below; and•Raising $920 million of cash by entering into amendments to the existing agreements for our U.S.-issued co-brand credit cards, which we discuss under the “Co-brand Credit Card Agreements” section below.We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We currently believe the Credit Facility, our cash on hand, and our access to capital markets remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements. Sources of LiquidityOur Credit FacilityOur Credit Facility provides for up to $4.5 billion of aggregate borrowings for general corporate needs, including to support our commercial paper program if and when we resume issuing commercial paper. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on June 28, 2024. In 2020, we made borrowings of $4.5 billion and repayments of $3.6 billion, resulting in total outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a financial covenant that limits our maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility, and generally consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility, and subject to additional adjustments as described therein). On April 13, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility (the “First Credit Facility Amendment”) under which the covenant governing the permitted Leverage Ratio is waived through and including the first quarter of 2021 (the “Covenant Waiver Period”), which waiver period may end sooner at our election, and the required leverage levels for such covenant are adjusted once re-imposed at the end of the Covenant Waiver Period (starting at 5.50 to 1.00 when the leverage test is first re-imposed and gradually stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 over the succeeding seven fiscal quarters, as further described in the Credit Facility). The First Credit Facility Amendment also imposes a monthly-tested minimum liquidity covenant for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period and makes certain other amendments to the terms of the Credit Facility, including increasing the interest and fees payable on the Credit Facility for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period, tightening certain existing covenants and imposing additional covenants for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period, including restricting dividends and share repurchases. On January 26, 2021, we entered into two more amendments to the Credit Facility (the “New Credit Facility Amendments,” and together with the First Credit Facility Amendment, the “Credit Facility Amendments”), which extend the 33Table of Contents Covenant Waiver Period through and including the fourth quarter of 2021 (which waiver period may end sooner at our election), revise the required leverage levels for such covenant when it is re-imposed at the end of the Covenant Waiver Period (starting at 5.50 to 1.00 when the leverage test is first re-imposed and gradually stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 over the succeeding five fiscal quarters, as further described in the Credit Facility), and increase the minimum liquidity amount under the liquidity covenant that is tested monthly for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period. The New Credit Facility Amendments also make certain other amendments to the terms of the Credit Facility, including reducing the rate floor for the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate and the Eurocurrency Rate.Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility, including the liquidity covenant under the Credit Facility.Senior Notes Issuances and RepurchasesOn April 16, 2020, we issued $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.750 percent Series EE Notes due May 1, 2025 (the “Series EE Notes”). We pay interest on the Series EE Notes in May and November of each year, commencing in November 2020. We received net proceeds of approximately $1.581 billion from the offering of the Series EE Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, which were made available for general corporate purposes.On June 1, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent Series FF Notes due June 15, 2030 (the “Series FF Notes”). We pay interest on the Series FF Notes in June and December of each year, commencing in December 2020. We received net proceeds of approximately $985 million from the offering of the Series FF Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses. We used the majority of these proceeds to repurchase Senior Notes with near term maturities, as discussed below and in Note 10.In June 2020, we completed a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) and retired $853 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes consisting of: •$351 million of our 2.3% Series Q Notes maturing January 15, 2022;•$176 million of our 3.3% Series L Notes maturing September 15, 2022; and •$326 million of our 2.1% Series DD Notes maturing October 3, 2022. We used proceeds from our Series FF Notes offering to complete the repurchase of such notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred.On August 14, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.500 percent Series GG Notes due October 15, 2032 (the “Series GG Notes”). We will pay interest on the Series GG Notes in April and October of each year, commencing in April 2021. We received net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the offering of the Series GG Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, which were made available for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Commercial PaperDue to changes to our credit ratings as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we currently are not issuing commercial paper. As a result, we have had to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility and issuance of senior notes, which carry higher interest costs than our commercial paper. Co-brand Credit Card Agreements In May 2020, we signed amendments to the existing agreements for our U.S.-issued co-brand credit cards associated with our Loyalty Program. These amendments provided the Company with $920 million of cash from the prepayment of certain future revenues, the early payment of a previously committed signing bonus, and the pre-purchase of Marriott Bonvoy points and other consideration. We recorded the amount of cash received primarily in the deferred revenue caption, and the remainder in the liability for guest loyalty program captions, on our Balance Sheet.Uses of CashCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $894 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $641 million from year-end 2019, primarily reflecting Senior Notes issuances, net of repayments ($1,797 million), Credit Facility borrowings, net of repayments ($900 million), net cash provided by operating activities ($1,639 million), and dispositions ($260 million). The following cash outflows partially offset these cash inflows: commercial paper repayments, net of borrowings ($3,190 million), 34Table of Contents dividend payments ($156 million), purchase of treasury stock ($150 million), capital and technology expenditures ($135 million), other debt repayments, net of borrowings ($123 million), and financing outflows for employee stock-based compensation withholding taxes ($103 million).Cash from OperationsNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $46 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the net loss that we recorded in 2020 (adjusted for non-cash items) due to COVID-19, partially offset by net cash inflows from our Loyalty Program, including the one-time cash payments as a result of the amendments to our co-brand credit card agreements discussed in Note 2, a cash benefit from working capital changes, and lower cash paid for income taxes. Working capital changes primarily reflect lower accounts receivable due to lower fee and cost reimbursement revenues and a higher allowance for credit losses, lower accounts payable due to lower purchasing activity, and lower bonus accruals.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.5 to 1.0 at both year-end 2020 and year-end 2019. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures, including expenditures on technology, of $135 million in 2020 and $653 million in 2019. Capital expenditures in 2020 decreased by $518 million compared to 2019, primarily reflecting the net lower spending on owned and leased properties and our worldwide systems and the 2019 acquisitions of a U.S. & Canada property and Elegant Hotels Group plc (“Elegant”).We expect spending on capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately $575 million to $650 million for 2021, including contract acquisition costs, equity and other investments, loan advances, and various capital expenditures (including approximately $220 million for maintenance capital spending and our new headquarters). Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. In the Starwood Combination, we acquired various hotels and equity interests in various hotels, many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell. We have made, and expect to continue making, selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include property acquisitions and renovations (such as our 2019 acquisitions of the W New York - Union Square and Elegant), new construction, loans, guarantees, and noncontrolling equity investments. Over time, we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to long-term management or franchise agreements.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $260 million cash proceeds in 2020 and $395 million in 2019. See Note 4 for more information on dispositions.Loan Activity. From time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan advances, net of loan collections, amounted to $33 million in 2020, compared to net collections of $21 million in 2019. At year-end 2020, we had $163 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans outstanding, compared to $126 million outstanding at year-end 2019. Financing Activities Cash FlowsDebt. Debt decreased by $564 million in 2020, to $10,376 million at year-end 2020 from $10,940 million at year-end 2019. See “Sources of Liquidity,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section and Note 10 for additional information on the Senior Note and Credit Facility transactions in 2020.Share Repurchases. We purchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock in 2020 (in the 2020 first quarter) at an average price of $145.42 per share and 17.3 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $130.79 per share. At year-end 2020, 17.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under Board approved authorizations. We do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until business conditions improve, and are prohibited from doing so for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period under our Credit Facility, with certain exceptions. For additional information, see “Fourth Quarter 2020 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. Dividends. On February 14, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per share payable to stockholders of record on February 28, 2020, which we paid on March 31, 2020. We do not anticipate declaring further cash dividends until business conditions improve and are prohibited from doing so for the duration of the Covenant Waiver Period under our Credit Facility.35Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at year-end 2020: Payments Due by Period($ in millions)TotalLess Than1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter5 YearsDebt (1)$12,453 $1,542 $2,143 $4,281 $4,487 Finance lease obligations (1)206 13 27 28 138 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor1,890 184 349 284 1,073 Purchase obligations 437 186 185 66 — Other noncurrent liabilities178 — 97 28 53 Total contractual obligations$15,164 $1,925 $2,801 $4,687 $5,751 (1)Includes principal as well as interest.The preceding table does not reflect projected Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax payments totaling $395 million at year-end 2020 as a result of the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, the table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at year-end 2020 of $508 million.In addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels or by working capital calls to the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.Other CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our guarantee, investment, and loan commitments at year-end 2020:($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommittedLess Than1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter5 YearsGuarantee commitments (expiration by period)$279 $35 $81 $40 $123 Investment and loan commitments (expected funding by period)22 12 7 3 — Total other commitments$301 $47 $88 $43 $123 In conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by entities in which we have an equity investment, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the entity.Additionally, in 2017, we granted a hotel owner a one-time right, exercisable in 2022, to require us to purchase the leasehold interest in the land and hotel for $300 million in cash (the “put option”). If the owner exercises the put option, we have the option to purchase, at the same time the put transaction closes, the fee simple interest in the underlying land for an additional $200 million in cash (the “call option”). We also have the right to defer the closing on the put and call options, if exercised, to December 2024. We account for the put option as a guarantee and as of December 31, 2020, believe it is probable the hotel owner will exercise the put option and we will exercise the call option.For further information, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the “Commitments” caption in Note 8.Letters of CreditAt year-end 2020, we had $156 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the Credit Facility, as defined in Note 10), most of which were for our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2020 totaled $163 million, most of which state governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.36Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.See Note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Loyalty Program, including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points, credit card points, and free night certificates, the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our co-brand credit card agreements, the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our co-brand credit card agreements, and the stand-alone selling prices of goods and services provided under our co-brand credit card agreements;Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments; andBusiness Combinations, including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates, royalty rates, and the amount and timing of future cash flows.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investments in publicly traded companies. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2 for more information on derivative instruments.37Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2020 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)20212022202320242025There-afterTotalCarryingAmountTotalFairValueAssets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed-rate notes receivable$2 $2 $1 $1 $1 $35 $42 $33 Average interest rate0.83 %Floating-rate notes receivable$2 $83 $1 $13 $1 $21 $121 $112 Average interest rate3.77 %Liabilities - Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed-rate debt$(849)$(572)$(674)$— $(2,293)$(3,804)$(8,192)$(9,100)Average interest rate4.06 %Floating-rate debt$(317)$(228)$— $(1,486)$— $— $(2,031)$(2,035)Average interest rate1.63 %38Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:04:49.838183
1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for year-end 2020 compared to year-end 2019 can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on April 2, 2021 (“2020 Form 10-K”).BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverviewWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties in 139 countries and territories under 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: U.S. & Canada and International.We earn base management fees and, under many agreements, incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. In most markets, base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue, or certain property-level revenue in the case of franchise fees, while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return. For our hotels in the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific excluding China, and Greater China regions, incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (also referred to as “house profit”) less non-controllable expenses such as property insurance, real estate taxes, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) reserves. Additionally, we earn franchise fees for use of our intellectual property, including fees from our co-brand credit card, timeshare, and residential programs.On September 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC, formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”), through a series of transactions, after which Starwood became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We refer to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.”Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available (including rooms in hotels temporarily closed due to issues related to COVID-19), measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. Comparisons to prior periods are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2020 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, with the exception of properties closed or otherwise experiencing interruptions related to COVID-19, which we continue to classify as comparable. For 2021 compared to 2020, we had 4,906 comparable U.S. & Canada properties and 1,510 comparable International properties. The RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy comparisons between 2021 and 2019, which we discuss under the “Impact of COVID-19” caption below, reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2021, even if in 2019 they were not open and operating for the full year or did not meet all the other criteria listed above.Impact of COVID-19COVID-19 continues to have a material impact on our business and industry. However, the recovery of both global demand and ADR continued in 2021, led primarily by robust leisure demand, which we expect to continue in 2022, and travelers who continue to embrace multi-purpose trips, mixing remote work and vacation time. The spread of COVID-19 variants, such as Delta and Omicron, constrained the pace of the recovery in the latter half of 2021 and continues to constrain the pace of recovery in the beginning of 2022. Business transient and group demand continued to slowly improve in 2021 when 23Table of Contents compared to 2020, though this demand still remains meaningfully below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Although we have seen delays in the recovery of business transient and group demand as a result of the emergence of COVID-19 variants, we expect this demand to gradually strengthen from current levels as more workers return to the office and travel again. We have been encouraged by the swift improvement in ADR, which in the 2021 second half returned to pre-pandemic 2019 levels in certain U.S. and International markets and are optimistic about sustaining strong ADR in 2022. However, we believe COVID-19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our future results for a period of time that we are currently unable to predict.Comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in 2021 compared to 2020 improved 67.7 percent in our U.S. & Canada segment, 40.6 percent in our International segment, and 60.4 percent worldwide. Comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in 2021 compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels declined 32.5 percent in our U.S. & Canada segment, 46.6 percent in our International segment, and 36.5 percent worldwide, with improvement in the decline each succeeding quarter during 2021 for each of our segments and worldwide. Worldwide comparable systemwide occupancy and constant dollar ADR were down only 11.9 percentage points and 2.3 percent, respectively, in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to the 2019 fourth quarter, leading to RevPAR 19.0 percent below pre-pandemic 2019 levels.In the U.S. & Canada, demand continued to recover in 2021, driven by strong leisure demand particularly at our luxury and resort hotels and in tertiary markets. Occupancy peaked in the 2021 third quarter before decreasing slightly in the 2021 fourth quarter primarily due to seasonality. Urban destinations, where we have a large presence in the U.S. & Canada, experienced meaningful improvement in demand in 2021, though they continue to lag the recovery. In other parts of the world, RevPAR continues to vary greatly by geographic market, and demand is heavily impacted by the number of COVID-19 cases, vaccination rates, and the nature and degree of government restrictions. In the 2021 fourth quarter, the decline of comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR when compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels improved compared to the decline seen in the 2021 third quarter in all our International regions except for Greater China, which remained flat as a result of strict government restrictions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks in several regions.We continue to take measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 for our hotel owners and our own business. At the corporate level, we remain focused on managing our corporate general and administrative costs and are being disciplined with respect to our capital expenditures and other investment spending. Share repurchases and cash dividends remain suspended until our leverage ratios further improve, although assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from COVID-19, we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond. In 2021, we substantially completed restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to our company-operated properties. In addition, we continue to work with owners and franchisees by adjusting renovation requirements for certain properties, deferring certain hotel initiatives, and supporting owners and franchisees who are working with their lenders to utilize FF&E reserves to meet working capital needs.We continue to evaluate the availability of stimulus tax credits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), and other legislation. As of February 1, 2022, we have received Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”) refunds from the U.S. Treasury totaling $170 million, including $119 million in 2020 and $51 million in 2021, of which we passed through $94 million and $48 million, respectively, to the related hotels that we manage on behalf of owners. We have received from the U.S. Treasury substantially all expected ERTC refunds based on applications that we have submitted as of February 1, 2022. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we have received or expect to receive, through Medicare tax offsets and payments from the U.S. Treasury pursuant to ARPA, a total of $35 million as reimbursement for the cost of health coverage continuation provided to eligible former associates and furloughed or part-time associates (and their eligible enrolled dependents) in accordance with requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 for the period of April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Finally, in 2021, we received subsidies totaling $28 million from German government COVID-19 assistance programs for certain of our leased hotels and equity method investments in Germany.The impact of COVID-19 on the Company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response. We expect to continue to assess the situation and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations and plans to address the implications of COVID-19 on our business. The overall operational and financial impact is highly dependent on the breadth and duration of COVID-19 and could be affected by other factors we are not currently able to predict.Starwood Data Security IncidentOn November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the “Data Security Incident”). The Starwood reservations database is no longer used for business operations.24Table of Contents We are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already incurred. However, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. Although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Security Incident, that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses (including fines and penalties) related to the Data Security Incident. In addition, certain expenses by their nature (such as, for example, expenses related to enhancing our cybersecurity program) are not covered by our insurance program. We expect to incur significant expenses associated with the Data Security Incident in future periods, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations (including possible additional fines and penalties), increased expenses and capital investments for information technology and information security and data privacy, and increased expenses for compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. See Note 7 for additional information related to expenses incurred in 2021, insurance recoveries, and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Data Security Incident.System Growth and PipelineIn 2021, our system grew from 7,642 properties (1,423,044 rooms) at year-end 2020 to 7,989 properties (1,479,179 rooms) at year-end 2021, reflecting gross additions of 517 properties (86,372 rooms) and deletions of 171 properties (30,236 rooms), including 88 properties from a primarily select-service portfolio which left our system in the 2021 first quarter. Approximately 50 percent of our 2021 gross room additions are located outside U.S. & Canada, and 21 percent were conversions from competitor brands.At year-end 2021, we had roughly 485,000 rooms in our development pipeline, which includes more than 202,000 hotel rooms under construction and approximately 19,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. Over half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside U.S. & Canada. In 2021, we signed management and franchise agreements for 599 properties, representing approximately 92,000 rooms, of which more than half of the rooms are located outside U.S. & Canada. Contracts signed in 2021 reflected the Company’s strength in the luxury tier, with 40 properties signed (resulting in a total of nearly 50,000 luxury rooms in our development pipeline at year-end 2021), as well as strong momentum in all-inclusive resort signings, with 22 properties signed in 2021. In addition, in 2021, longer stay brands, which include Element Hotels, Residence Inn, and TownePlace Suites, accounted for 37 percent of the Company's rooms signings in U.S. & Canada. Conversions accounted for 27 percent of rooms signings in 2021.In 2022, we expect total gross rooms growth to approach 5.0 percent and net rooms growth of 3.5 to 4.0 percent.Properties and RoomsAt year-end 2021, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties and rooms: ManagedFranchised/LicensedOwned/LeasedResidentialTotalPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsU.S. & Canada638 218,798 4,983 713,781 26 6,483 65 6,925 5,712 945,987 International1,305 334,374 805 163,955 38 9,209 37 2,953 2,185 510,491 Timeshare— — 92 22,701 — — — — 92 22,701 Total1,943 553,172 5,880 900,437 64 15,692 102 9,878 7,989 1,479,179 25Table of Contents Lodging StatisticsThe following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics for comparable properties for 2021 and 2021 compared to 2020.

In 2021, we earned incentive management fees from 47 percent of our managed properties worldwide, compared to 37 percent in 2020. We earned incentive management fees from 13 percent of our U.S. & Canada managed properties and 63 percent of our International managed properties in 2021, compared to 3 percent in U.S. & Canada and 56 percent in International in 2020. In addition, 71 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2021 came from our International managed properties versus 92 percent in 2020.26Table of Contents Contract investment amortization changed primarily due to lower impairments of investments in management and franchise contracts.Owned, Leased, and Other($ in millions)20212020Change 2021 vs. 2020Owned, leased, and other revenue$796 $568 $228 40 %Owned, leased, and other - direct expenses734 677 57 8 %Owned, leased, and other, net$62 $(109)$171 nm** Percentage change is not meaningful.Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses increased primarily due to net stronger results at our owned and leased properties driven by the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of COVID-19, higher termination fees of $20 million, and $18 million of subsidies under German government COVID-19 assistance programs for certain of our leased hotels.Cost Reimbursements($ in millions)20212020Change 2021 vs. 2020Cost reimbursement revenue$10,442 $8,452 $1,990 24 %Reimbursed expenses10,322 8,435 1,887 22 %Cost reimbursements, net$120 $17 $103 nm** Percentage change is not meaningful.Cost reimbursements, net (cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses) varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees. Over the long term, our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. See Note 2 for more information about the accounting for cost reimbursements, including our Loyalty Program.The increase in cost reimbursements, net primarily reflects higher revenues, net of expenses, for our centralized programs and services.

See Note 8 for more information about the operating lease impairment charges.General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation costs compared to our 2020 cost reduction measures, which included reducing compensation, implementing reduced work weeks for many of our corporate associates, and furloughing a substantial number of associates, as well as higher legal expenses ($34 million). The increase was partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses ($76 million) and a favorable litigation settlement ($18 million).Restructuring and merger-related charges decreased primarily due to the prior year increase to the put option liability discussed in Note 7 ($243 million) and 2020 restructuring charges ($56 million), partially offset by the 2020 partial reversal of the liability related to the ICO fine, which was reduced to £18.4 million in October 2020 ($39 million).27Table of Contents Non-Operating Income (Expense)($ in millions)20212020Change 2021 vs. 2020Gains and other income, net$10 $9 $1 11 %Loss on extinguishment of debt(164)— (164)nm*Interest expense(420)(445)25 6 %Interest income28 27 1 4 %Equity in losses(24)(141)117 83 %* Percentage change is not meaningful.In the 2021 third quarter, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt due to the Tender Offer discussed in Note 9.Interest expense changed, primarily due to lower Credit Facility and commercial paper average borrowings and interest rates, partially offset by higher interest on Senior Note issuances, net of maturities.Equity in losses changed, primarily due to 2020 impairment losses ($77 million) and the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of COVID-19.Income Taxes($ in millions)20212020Change 2021 vs. 2020(Provision) benefit for income taxes$(81)$199 $(280)(141)%Our tax provision in 2021, compared to our tax benefit in 2020, primarily reflected the increase in operating income ($256 million), lower tax benefit from impairment charges ($64 million) and the prior year tax benefit from the Sheraton Grand Chicago put option reserve ($61 million). The change was partially offset by the current year release of tax reserves due to favorable audit resolutions during 2021 ($43 million) and a current year tax benefit from the loss on extinguishment of debt ($42 million).BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur segment results in 2021 continued to be impacted by COVID-19.

At year-end 2021, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 6.5 years. Including the effect of interest rate swaps, the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2021.In response to the negative impact COVID-19 had on our cash from operations in 2021 and 2020, which we expect to continue to be negatively impacted, we remain focused on preserving our financial flexibility and managing our debt maturities. We also remain focused on managing our corporate general and administrative costs and our capital expenditures and other investment spending. Share repurchases and dividends remain suspended until our leverage ratios further improve, although assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from COVID-19, we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond. In 2021, we issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, redeemed all $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Series N Notes, and repurchased and retired $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our Series EE Notes maturing in 2025, which we discuss further under the “Sources of Liquidity - Senior Notes Issuances, Redemptions, and Repurchases” section below and in Note 9.We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We currently believe the Credit Facility, our cash on hand, and our access to capital markets remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements. Sources of LiquidityOur Credit FacilityOur Credit Facility provides for up to $4.5 billion of aggregate borrowings for general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, letters of credit, acquisitions, and to support our commercial paper program if and when we resume issuing commercial paper. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (if any) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on June 28, 2024. As of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $1.1 billion and remaining borrowing capacity of $3.4 billion. We entered into amendments to the Credit Facility in April 2020 and January 2021 (the “Credit Facility Amendments”), as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as amended. The debt leverage covenant in the Credit Facility, which is tested each quarter and was waived pursuant to the Credit Facility Amendments through and including the fourth quarter of 2021, resumes beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2022. The Credit Facility Amendments adjusted the required leverage levels for this covenant when it is re-imposed (starting at 5.50 to 1.00 for the test period ending on March 31, 2022 and gradually stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 over the succeeding five fiscal quarters, as further described in the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility Amendments also amended certain other terms of the Credit Facility, including reducing the rate floor for the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate and the Eurocurrency Rate.Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility.Senior Notes Issuances, Redemptions, and RepurchasesIn January 2022, we made a $404 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series Q Notes.In September 2021, we completed a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) and purchased and retired $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.750 percent Series EE Notes maturing May 1, 2025. We used the net proceeds from our Series II Notes offering described below and cash on hand to complete the repurchase of such Series EE Notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred. As a result of the Tender Offer, in the 2021 third quarter, we recorded a loss of $164 million in the “Loss on extinguishment of debt” caption of our Income Statements.In September 2021, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750 percent Series II Notes due October 15, 2033 (the “Series II Notes”). We will pay interest on the Series II Notes in April and October of each year, commencing in April 2022. We received net proceeds of approximately $693 million from the offering of the Series II Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds to fund the Tender Offer, as further described above.30Table of Contents In August 2021, we redeemed all $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Series N Notes due in October 2021.In March 2021, we issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.850 percent Series HH Notes due April 15, 2031 (the “Series HH Notes”). We pay interest on the Series HH Notes in April and October of each year. We received net proceeds of approximately $1,089 million from the offering of the Series HH Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, which were made available for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Commercial PaperDue to changes to our credit ratings as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we currently are not issuing commercial paper. As a result, we have had to rely more on borrowings under the Credit Facility and issuance of senior notes, which carry higher interest costs than commercial paper.Uses of CashCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $1,421 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $527 million from year-end 2020, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities ($1,177 million) and Credit Facility borrowings, net of repayments ($150 million), partially offset by Senior Notes repayments, net of issuances ($368 million), capital and technology expenditures ($183 million), cash paid for debt extinguishment costs associated with the Tender Offer ($155 million), and financing outflows for employee stock-based compensation withholding taxes ($90 million).Cash from OperationsNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $462 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to net cash inflow from our Loyalty Program in 2020 and higher cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by higher net income recorded in 2021 (adjusted for non-cash items and the loss on extinguishment of debt). Cash inflow from our Loyalty Program in 2020 included $920 million of cash received from the prepayment of certain future revenues under the amendments to our existing U.S.-issued co-brand credit card agreements, which reduced in 2021 and will in the future reduce the amount of cash we receive from these card issuers.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.6 to 1.0 at year-end 2021 and 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2020. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital and technology expenditures of $183 million in 2021 and $135 million in 2020. Capital expenditures in 2021 increased by $48 million compared to 2020, primarily reflecting higher spending on our new headquarters.We expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately $600 million to $700 million for 2022, including capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities (including approximately $250 million for maintenance capital spending and our new headquarters). Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We have made, and expect to continue making, selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include property acquisitions and renovations, new construction, loans, guarantees, and equity investments. Over time, we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to long-term management or franchise agreements.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $12 million cash proceeds in 2021 and $260 million in 2020.Loan Activity. From time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $27 million in 2021, compared to net advances of $33 million in 2020. At year-end 2021, we had $153 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans outstanding, compared to $163 million outstanding at year-end 2020. 31Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash FlowsDebt. Debt decreased by $238 million in 2021, to $10,138 million at year-end 2021 from $10,376 million at year-end 2020. See “Sources of Liquidity,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section and Note 9 for additional information on the Senior Note and Credit Facility transactions in 2021.Share Repurchases and Dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2021. At year-end 2021, 17.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under Board approved authorizations. We also did not declare any cash dividends in 2021. We do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares or declaring cash dividends until our leverage ratios further improve. Assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from COVID-19, we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond.Material Cash RequirementsOur material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements.•At year-end 2021, we had $12,169 million of debt, including principal and future interest payments, of which $1,134 million is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2021. See Note 9 for further information about our long-term debt.•We enter into operating and finance leases primarily for hotels, offices, and equipment, which are discussed in Note 8.•At December 31, 2021, projected Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax payments under the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, totaled $349 million, of which $43 million is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2021.•The Company also had guarantees, a contingent purchase obligation, commitments, and letters of credit as of year-end 2021, which are discussed in Note 7. The majority of our guarantee commitments are not expected to be funded within the next 12 months from year-end 2021. In addition to the purchase obligations discussed in Note 7, in the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments and incur other obligations to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since our contracts with owners require reimbursement for these amounts, these obligations are expected to have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.See Note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Loyalty Program, including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points, credit card points, and free night certificates, the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our co-brand credit card agreements, the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our co-brand credit card agreements, and the stand-alone selling prices of goods and services provided under our co-brand credit card agreements. Changes in these estimates could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and Loyalty Program revenue. Based on the conditions existing at December 31, 2021 and holding other factors constant, a one percent decrease in our estimate of the breakage of points could result in an increase in the liability for guest loyalty program of approximately $40 million. The breakage impact may vary significantly depending on the specific Loyalty Program points for which the anticipated breakage changes.32Table of Contents Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill. During the 2021 fourth quarter, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and no impairment charges were recorded. The estimated fair values of all our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination.Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets. During 2021, we evaluated our intangibles and long-lived asset groups for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges. The estimated fair values of all our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their carrying values at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination.Investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments. During 2021, we evaluated our investments for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through the development and application of credit granting policies, and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2 for more information on derivative instruments.The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2021 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)20222023202420252026There-afterTotalCarryingAmountTotalFairValueAssets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts.

1048286,MAR,MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC /MD/,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for year-end 2021 compared to year-end 2020 can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2022 (“2021 Form 10-K”).BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWOverviewWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties in 138 countries and territories under 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: (1) U.S. & Canada and (2) International.Terms of our management agreements vary, but our management fees generally consist of base management fees and incentive management fees. Base management fees are typically calculated as a percentage of property-level revenue. Incentive management fees are typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure, and, in many cases (particularly in our U.S. & Canada, Europe, and Caribbean & Latin America regions), are subject to a specified owner return. Under our franchise agreements, franchise fees are typically calculated as a percentage of property-level revenue or a portion thereof. Additionally, we earn franchise fees for the use of our intellectual property, such as fees from our co-branded credit card, timeshare, and residential programs.On September 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC, formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”), through a series of transactions, after which Starwood became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.Performance Measures We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available (including rooms in hotels temporarily closed due to issues related to COVID-19), measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics are on a systemwide basis for comparable properties, unless otherwise stated. Comparisons to prior periods are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.We define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2021 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, with the exception of properties closed or otherwise experiencing interruptions related to COVID-19, which we continue to classify as comparable. For 2022 compared to 2021, we had 5,123 comparable U.S. & Canada properties and 1,548 comparable International properties. RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019, which we discuss under the “Business Trends” caption below, reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, or March 31, 2022 (as applicable), even if in 2019 they were not open and operating for the full year or did not meet all the other criteria listed above. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic or 2019 are comparing to the same time period each year.Business TrendsWe continued to see strong global RevPAR improvement throughout 2022 despite Greater China continuing to be significantly negatively impacted by COVID-19 through the end of the 2022 fourth quarter. While RevPAR recovery at the beginning of 2022 was dampened due to the emergence of COVID-19 variants, RevPAR quickly improved, resulting in 2022 third quarter worldwide RevPAR exceeding 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. By the 2022 fourth quarter, 20Table of Contents worldwide RevPAR exceeded 2019 levels by 4.6 percent, reflecting ADR growth of 12.8 percent, partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 5.1 percentage points compared to 2019 levels. The global recovery continued across all customer segments, led by robust leisure demand as well as strengthening group demand, which was higher than 2019 levels in certain regions during the 2022 fourth quarter. Business transient demand also continued to improve during 2022, although it continued to lag behind 2019 levels.RevPAR in 2022 compared to 2021 improved 46.5 percent in our U.S. & Canada segment, 66.2 percent in our International segment, and 51.0 percent worldwide. RevPAR in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels declined 4.0 percent worldwide, with improvement in the decline each succeeding quarter during 2022 for each of our segments and worldwide.In the U.S. & Canada, RevPAR declined only 0.8 percent in 2022 compared to 2019, due to a decline in occupancy of 6.0 percentage points, partially offset by ADR growth of 8.1 percent. In the 2022 fourth quarter, U.S. & Canada RevPAR improved 5.2 percent compared to the same period in 2019, due to ADR growth of 11.1 percent, partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 3.7 percentage points. The decline in occupancy as compared to 2019 improved sequentially in each quarter of 2022, reflecting strong demand recovery in many markets within the U.S. & Canada.Internationally, RevPAR declined 11.9 percent in 2022 compared to 2019, due to a decline in occupancy of 12.2 percentage points, partially offset by ADR growth of 7.0 percent. In the 2022 fourth quarter, International RevPAR improved 3.4 percent compared to the same period in 2019, due to ADR growth of 17.3 percent, partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 8.3 percentage points. In the 2022 fourth quarter, RevPAR remained significantly below 2019 levels in Greater China, but exceeded pre-pandemic 2019 levels in the Caribbean & Latin America, Europe, Middle East & Africa, and Asia Pacific excluding China regions, driven by strengthening demand, especially from cross-border guests and meaningful growth in ADR.Although COVID-19’s negative impact on our business has significantly decreased and we saw strong global RevPAR improvement in 2022, our business is subject to the effects of changes in global and regional conditions and these conditions can change rapidly. We continue to monitor global economic conditions, and although we are not currently seeing signs of a slowdown in lodging demand, the lodging booking window is short and trends can change quickly. Starwood Data Security IncidentOn November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the “Data Security Incident”). The Starwood reservations database is no longer used for business operations.We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already recorded. However, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. Although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Security Incident, that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses (including monetary payments to regulators and/or litigants) related to the Data Security Incident. In addition, certain expenses by their nature (such as, for example, expenses related to enhancing our cybersecurity program) are not covered by our insurance program. We expect to incur significant expenses associated with the Data Security Incident in future periods in excess of the amounts already recorded, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations (including possible additional monetary payments to regulators and/or litigants as well as costs associated with compliance with any settlements or resolutions of matters). See Note 7 for additional information related to legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Data Security Incident.System Growth and PipelineIn 2022, our system grew from 7,989 properties (1,479,179 rooms) at year-end 2021 to 8,288 properties (1,525,407 rooms) at year-end 2022, reflecting gross additions of 394 properties (65,376 rooms) and deletions of 94 properties (19,079 rooms), including the impact of the Company’s decision to suspend its operations in Russia. Approximately 61 percent of our 2022 gross room additions were located outside U.S. & Canada, and 27 percent were conversions from competitor brands.21Table of Contents At year-end 2022, we had more than 496,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline, which includes approximately 199,000 hotel rooms under construction and roughly 22,300 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. Over half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside U.S. & Canada. In 2022, we signed 726 new management and franchise agreements, representing nearly 108,000 rooms, of which approximately half of the rooms are located outside U.S. & Canada. Our Select hotel brands continued to be a key growth driver globally with 523 hotel properties signed during 2022. In particular, our longer stay brands, which include Element Hotels, Residence Inn, and TownePlace Suites, accounted for 30 percent of the Company’s signings in 2022. In addition, contracts signed in 2022 reflected the Company’s strength in the luxury tier, with 42 luxury hotel agreements signed, representing nearly 8,000 rooms. Conversions accounted for nearly 20 percent of rooms signings in 2022.In 2023, we expect total gross rooms growth of approximately 5.5 percent and net rooms growth of 4.0 to 4.5 percent, including approximately 1.1 percent from the anticipated addition of rooms associated with the City Express brand acquisition discussed in Note 3, which are not reflected in the development pipeline discussed above.Properties and RoomsAt year-end 2022, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties and rooms: ManagedFranchised/LicensedOwned/LeasedResidentialTotalPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsPropertiesRoomsU.S. & Canada632 215,331 5,121 735,470 26 6,483 67 7,128 5,846 964,412 International1,357 345,220 907 179,319 38 9,209 46 4,353 2,348 538,101 Timeshare— — 93 22,745 — — — — 93 22,745 Yacht— — 1 149 — — — — 1 149 Total1,989 560,551 6,122 937,683 64 15,692 113 11,481 8,288 1,525,407 Lodging StatisticsThe following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics for comparable properties for 2022, and 2022 compared to 2021.

In 2022, we earned incentive management fees from 61 percent of our managed properties worldwide, compared to 47 percent in 2021. We earned incentive management fees from 29 percent of our U.S. & Canada managed properties and 76 percent of our International managed properties in 2022, compared to 13 percent in U.S. & Canada and 63 percent in International in 2021.

Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027.The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1.0. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios.We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and liquidity needs.We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We believe the Credit Facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements.Commercial PaperWe issue commercial paper in the U.S. Because we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets.Cash from OperationsNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,186 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher net income (adjusted for non-cash items and the prior year loss on extinguishment of debt), partially offset by higher cash paid for income taxes and working capital changes driven by accounts receivable timing. Cash inflow from our Loyalty Program in 2020 included $920 million of cash received from the prepayment of certain future revenues under the 2020 amendments to our existing U.S.-issued co-branded credit card agreements, which reduced in both 2021 and 2022, and will in the future reduce, the amount of cash we receive from these card issuers. We expect such reductions to end by year-end 2023.Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2022 and 0.6 to 1.0 at year-end 2021. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital and technology expenditures of $332 million in 2022 and $183 million in 2021. Capital and technology expenditures in 2022 increased by $149 million compared to 2021, primarily reflecting higher spending on improvements to our worldwide technology systems.We expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately $850 million to $1 billion for 2023, including capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities (including approximately $300 million for maintenance capital spending). This estimate also includes $100 million of investment spending related to the City Express brand acquisition discussed in Note 3, which we currently expect to close in the first half of 2023, and approximately $160 million of renovation spending on hotels that we expect to sell after renovations are complete.Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We have made, and expect to continue making, selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include property acquisitions and renovations, new construction, loans, guarantees, and equity 26Table of Contents investments. Over time, we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to long-term management or franchise agreements.Loan Activity. From time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $3 million in 2022, compared to net collections of $27 million in 2021. At year-end 2022, we had $162 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans outstanding, compared to $153 million outstanding at year-end 2021. Financing Activities Cash FlowsDebt. Debt decreased by $74 million in 2022, to $10,064 million at year-end 2022 from $10,138 million at year-end 2021, primarily due to lower outstanding Credit Facility borrowings ($1,050 million), the maturity of our Series Q Notes ($399 million), the maturity of our Series DD Notes ($224 million), and the redemption of our Series L Notes ($173 million), partially offset by the issuance of our Series JJ Notes ($983 million) and higher outstanding commercial paper borrowings ($868 million). See Note 9 for additional information on the Senior Notes issuance and redemption.Our long-term financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2022, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.1 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.8 years. Including the effect of interest rate swaps, the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.9 to 1.0 at year-end 2022.See the “Our Credit Facility,” caption in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for more information on our Credit Facility.Share Repurchases and Dividends. We repurchased 16.8 million shares of our common stock for $2.6 billion in 2022. Year-to-date through February 10, 2023, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $400 million. For additional information, see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5.Our Board of Directors declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2022: (1) $0.30 per share declared on May 2, 2022 and paid on June 30, 2022 to stockholders of record on May 16, 2022; (2) $0.30 per share declared on August 4, 2022 and paid on September 30, 2022 to stockholders of record on August 18, 2022; and (3) $0.40 per share declared on November 10, 2022 and paid on December 30, 2022 to stockholders of record on November 23, 2022. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share on February 10, 2023, payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record on February 24, 2023.We expect to continue to return cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.Material Cash RequirementsOur material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements.•At year-end 2022, we had $11,989 million of debt, including principal and future interest payments, of which $1,032 million is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2022. See Note 9 for further information about our long-term debt.•We enter into operating and finance leases primarily for hotels, offices, and equipment, which are discussed in Note 8.•At December 31, 2022, projected Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax payments under the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, totaled $336 million, of which $89 million is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2022.•The Company also had guarantees, a contingent purchase obligation, commitments, and letters of credit as of year-end 2022, which are discussed in Note 7. The majority of our guarantee commitments are not expected to be funded within the next 12 months from year-end 2022. In addition to the purchase obligations discussed in Note 7, in the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments and incur other obligations to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since our contracts with owners require reimbursement for these amounts, these obligations are expected to have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSWe do not expect that accounting standard updates issued to date and that are effective after December 31, 2022 will have a material effect on our Financial Statements. 27Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.See Note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:Loyalty Program, including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points, credit card points, and free night certificates, the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our co-branded credit card agreements, the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our co-branded credit card agreements, and the stand-alone selling prices of goods and services provided under our co-branded credit card agreements. Changes in these estimates could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and Loyalty Program revenue. Based on the conditions existing at December 31, 2022 and holding other factors constant, a one percent decrease in our estimate of the breakage of points could result in an increase in the liability for guest loyalty program of approximately $50 million. The breakage impact may vary significantly depending on the specific Loyalty Program points for which the anticipated breakage changes.Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and no impairment charges were recorded. The estimated fair values of all our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination.Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets. During 2022, we evaluated our intangibles and long-lived asset groups for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges. The estimated fair values of all our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through the development and application of credit granting policies, and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable and floating-rate debt. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2 for more information on derivative instruments.28Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year-end 2022 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)20232024202520262027There-afterTotalCarryingAmountTotalFairValueAssets - Maturities represent expected principal receipts.
