MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of the company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

AND LINDE AGOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde (collectively referred to as the “business combination” or ""merger""). Prior to the business combination, the company did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the business combination agreement. Praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer for the merger. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Praxair for the periods prior to the merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of Linde. The results of Linde AG are included in Linde’s consolidated results from the merger date forward. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LIN”. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.In connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG, entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements required the sale of the majority of Praxair’s European businesses (completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG’s America’s business (completed on March 1, 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are expected to be sold in 2019 (collectively, the “merger-related divestitures”). In the consolidated financial statements, Praxair’s merger-related divestitures are included in the results of operations until sold and Linde AG’s merger-related divestitures are accounted for as discontinued operations. See Notes 4 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures. Additionally, to obtain merger approval in the United States Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission dated October 1, 2018 (“hold separate order” or “HSO”). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other’s operations; and not coordinate any aspect of their operations until certain divestitures in the United States were completed. Accordingly, Linde has accounted for Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date. Prior to the merger date, the company’s Linde AG segment did not exist. Since the FTC hold separate order restrictions were lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company subsequently implemented a new operating segment structure as follows: Americas; EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa); APAC (Asia/Pacific), Engineering and Other. This new management structure will be used for 2019 reporting and comparative prior period information will be presented on a consistent basis. 22Table of ContentsBUSINESS OVERVIEWWith the merger, Linde is the leading industrial gas company worldwide. The company's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use; and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. The company’s surface technologies segment supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. Linde’s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2018, 76% of sales were generated by Praxair's four geographic segments (North America, Europe, South America, and Asia), and since the merger date, the Linde AG segment generated 19% of consolidated sales. The surface technologies segment generated the remaining 5% of sales.Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.Linde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North and South America (""Americas"") Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) Asia and Pacific (“APAC”)United States Germany ChinaCanada United Kingdom IndiaMexico Scandinavia South KoreaBrazil Republic of South Africa* Australia/New Zealand* Taiwan*Added with the Linde AG mergerThe company manufactures and distributes its products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company’s customer base. The majority of Linde’s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, healthcare, food and beverage, and aerospace. 23Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK2018 Year in reviewOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock merger transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde plc. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018. •Sales of $14,900 million were 30% above 2017 sales of $11,437 million, primarily driven by the merger with Linde AG that contributed 24% to sales, net of divestitures. Underlying sales increased 6% driven by volume growth primarily in North America and Asia, including new project start-ups, and higher price. •Reported operating profit of $5,247 million was 115% above 2017. Adjusted operating profit of $2,976 million was 19% above adjusted operating profit in 2017. Adjusted operating profit growth was driven by higher volumes and price across the geographic segments and the impact of the merger.* •Income from continuing operations of $4,273 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $12.79 increased from $1,247 million and $4.32, respectively in 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $2,121 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.35 were 26% and 9%, respectively above 2017 adjusted amounts.*•Cash flow from operations was $3,654 million, or 25% of sales. Capital expenditures were $1,883 million; dividends paid were $1,166 million; and debt repayments, net were $2,908 million.•Cash on hand at December 31, 2018 was $4,466 million versus $617 million at December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily a result of the stock only merger with Linde AG and proceeds from the sale of Praxair's European industrial gases business. The cash is available for Corporate uses, including among others the planned squeeze-out of the 8% Linde AG noncontrolling interests and stock buybacks.* A reconciliation of the Adjusted amounts can be found in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section in this MD&A. See Notes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.2019 OutlookThe company’s business is to build, own, and operate industrial gas plants in order to supply atmospheric and process gases to customers. As such, Linde believes that its sale of gas project backlog is one indicator of future sales growth. At December 31, 2018, Linde’s backlog of large projects under construction was $3.5 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction. APAC and Americas represent 49 percent and 42 percent of the backlog, respectively, with the remaining backlog in EMEA. These plants will primarily supply customers in the energy, chemical, and electronics end-markets.The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”Linde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

Underlying sales increased 6% driven by higher volumes and pricing. Volume growth of 4% was driven by higher volumes in North America and Asia, including new project start-ups. Higher overall pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales. Currency translation impact decreased sales by 1%. Higher cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. The divestiture of Praxair's European businesses in December of 2018 decreased sales by 1%. Gross margin increased $840 million, or 17%, versus 2017 primarily due to the merger. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to 39.0% in 2018 from 43.5% in 2017 and was negatively impacted by a $368 million charge for the fair value step-up of inventories acquired in the merger. Excluding this charge, gross margin in 2018 was 41.5%.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses increased $422 million, or 35%, in 2018 to $1,629 million primarily due to the merger. SG&A was 10.9% of sales in 2018 versus 10.6% in 2017, primarily due to the merger.Depreciation and amortization expense increased $646 million, or 55%, versus 2017. The increase is primarily due to the merger, including $346 million of purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in the merger. Transaction costs and other charges were $309 million and $52 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively and are primarily related to the merger. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Net gain on the sale of businesses was $3,294 million and related primarily to the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business in connection with the merger. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.28Table of ContentsOther income (expenses) – net in 2018 was a $18 million benefit versus a $4 million benefit in 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of major components). In North America, 2018 included a $30 million asset impairment charge which was more than offset by $43 million of gains on asset disposals. In Asia, 2018 included a $22 million asset impairment charge, offset by a litigation settlement gain.Reported operating profit of $5,247 million in 2018 was $2,803 million, or 115% higher than reported operating profit of $2,444 million in 2017. 2018 includes a net gain on sale of businesses of $3,294 million, partially offset by transaction costs and other charges of $309 million, and purchase accounting impacts of $714 million related to the Linde AG merger (see Notes 4, 5 and 3, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements). 2017 included transaction costs of $52 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating profit of $2,976 million in 2018 was $480 million, or 19%, higher than adjusted operating profit of $2,496 million in 2017 driven primarily by the merger. Higher volumes and price in the geographic segments and surface technologies also contributed to operating profit growth. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows. Reported interest expense – net in 2018 increased $41 million, or 25%, versus 2017. 2018 included charges of $26 million relating to the early redemption of notes and a decrease of $21 million related to purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of debt acquired in the merger (see Notes 13 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively). Excluding these impacts, adjusted interest expense of $197 million increased $36 million, or 22%, largely attributable to interest on the debt acquired in the merger and lower capitalized interest. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to interest expense.The reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2018 was 16.2% versus 44.9% in 2017. The decrease in the ETR for the 2018 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of the sale of Praxair's European industrial gases business. The increase in the ETR for the 2017 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the net $394 million charge related to the Tax Act. Excluding these and other smaller impacts as set forth in the ""Non-GAAP financial measures"" section of this MD&A, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2018 and 2017 periods was 23.8% and 27.2%, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact of the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Linde’s equity investments are primarily located in the United States, China, and the Middle East. Equity income increased $9 million in 2018 versus 2017 and included charges of $9 million for purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value step up of equity investments acquired in the merger. Excluding this impact, equity income increased $18 million, primarily driven by income from equity investments acquired in the merger.At December 31, 2018, reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in Asia (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $46 million to $15 million in 2018 from $61 million in 2017. 2018 includes the impact of the merger and related purchase accounting impacts. Excluding these impacts, adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations of $73 million increased $12 million, or 20%, primarily due to noncontrolling interests acquired in the merger.Reported income from continuing operations for 2018 was $4,273 million, $3,026 million, or 243%, higher than reported income from continuing operations of $1,247 million in 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $2,121 million in 2018 was $431 million, or 26%, higher than adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,690 million in 2017 primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and a lower effective tax rate.Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (""EPS"") of $12.79 in 2018 increased $8.47 per diluted share, or 196% from $4.32 in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.35 in 2018 increased $0.50 per diluted share, or 9%, from adjusted diluted EPS of $5.85 in 2017. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to the merger and higher adjusted income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in diluted shares resulting from equity acquired in the merger.Other comprehensive losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $299 million resulted primarily from (i) a $221 million unfavorable impact in the funded status of Linde's retirement obligations and (ii) adverse currency translation adjustments of $76 million, net of a benefit of $318 million related to the release of currency translation adjustments on Praxair's European business (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The decrease in the funded status of retirement obligations was primarily the result of higher current year actuarial losses, as the impact of higher U.S. discount rates was largely offset by a lower actual return on assets. Unfavorable translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar. 29Table of ContentsUnfavorable currency translation adjustments included $343 million in South America and $149 million in Asia, partially offset by favorable currency translation adjustments of $231 million related to Linde AG (primarily Europe and Asia) representing translation impacts for the period from merger date through December 31, 2018. Remaining other comprehensive losses of $2 million relate to the amortization of deferred losses on the company's derivatives and unrealized losses on available for sale securities. Refer to the Currency section of the MD&A and Notes 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.The number of employees at December 31, 2018 was 80,820, an increase of 54,359 employees from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 56,000 related to the merger partially offset by a decrease of approximately 2,500 from the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business. Other Financial DataEarnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") increased $3,458 million to $7,133 million in 2018 from $3,675 million in 2017. EBITDA in 2018 includes a gain on sale of businesses and purchase accounting impacts, and both periods include transaction and other costs. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted EBITDA increased $789 million to $4,516 million in 2018 from $3,727 million in 2017 driven by the consolidation of Linde AG starting October 31, 2018, and higher adjusted income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization versus the prior year.See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for definitions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported amounts.2017 Compared With 2016Sales increased 9% to $11,437 million in 2017 compared to $10,534 million in 2016. Excluding favorable currency translation of 1% and higher cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, which increased sales by 2%, sales growth was 6%. Volume growth of 5% was driven by higher volumes in North America, Europe and Asia, including new project start-ups, and growth in all end-markets. Higher price increased sales by 1%.Gross margin increased $297 million, or 6%, versus 2016 primarily due to higher sales. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to 43.5% in 2017 from 44.4% in 2016 largely driven by the contractual pass-through of higher natural gas costs to customers.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62 million or 5% in 2017 to $1,207 million, and decreased to 10.6% of sales versus 10.9% of sales for 2016. Currency impacts increased SG&A by $14 million. Excluding currency impacts, SG&A increased $48 million driven by higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and cost inflation partially offset by cost reduction actions.Depreciation and amortization expense increased $62 million versus 2016. Currency impacts increased depreciation and amortization expense by $15 million. Excluding currency impacts, depreciation and amortization expense increased $47 million, or 4%, primarily due to large project start ups and acquisitions.During the year ended December 31, 2017, Linde recorded transaction costs and other charges of $52 million primarily related to the merger. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Linde recorded charges of $96 million related primarily to a cost reduction program. (Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.) Other income (expenses) – net in 2017 was a $4 million benefit versus a $23 million benefit in 2016 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of major components). Other income in 2016 is largely related to net gains on asset sales.Reported operating profit of $2,444 million in 2017 was $197 million, or 9% higher than reported operating profit of $2,247 million in 2016. 2017 included transaction costs of $52 million. 2016 included charges of $96 million related to cost reduction actions. Refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these items. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating profit of $2,496 million in 2017 was $153 million, or 7% higher than adjusted operating profit of $2,343 million in 2016 driven by higher volumes and price. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.Reported interest expense – net in 2017 decreased $29 million, or 15%, versus 2016. 2016 included charges of $16 million relating to the early redemption of notes (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding this 30Table of Contentscharge, adjusted interest expense decreased $13 million, or 7%, largely attributable to overall lower net debt. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to interest expense.The reported effective tax rate for 2017 was 44.9% versus 26.9% in 2016. The ETR for the 2017 period included a net $394 million tax charge related to the Tax Act and a $5 million tax benefit related to transaction costs and a pension settlement (see Note 5 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The ETR for the 2016 period includes a $35 million tax benefit related to a pension settlement, bond redemption and cost reduction program and other charges (see Note 13 and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding these impacts, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2017 and 2016 periods was relatively flat at 27.2% and 27.1%, respectively.Linde’s equity investments are primarily located in the United States, China, Italy, and the Middle East. Equity income increased $6 million in 2017.At December 31, 2017, reported noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in Asia (primarily in China), Europe (primarily in Italy), and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests increased $23 million to $61 million in 2017 from $38 million in 2016. Reported noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a reduction of $5 million related to a cost reduction program. The remaining increase was driven by PG Technologies, LLC (""PGT""), a surface technologies joint venture with GE Aviation formed in the fourth quarter of 2016 (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).Reported income from continuing operations in 2017 was $1,247 million, or $253 million lower than $1,500 million in 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,690 million in 2017 was $114 million, or 7% higher than $1,576 million in 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and lower adjusted interest expense - net.Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.32 in 2017 decreased $0.89 per diluted share, or 17% from $5.21 in 2016. The decrease included a $1.36 net income tax charge related to the Tax Act and a $0.17 charge related to transaction costs and other charges (see Note 7 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $5.85 in 2017 increased $0.37 per diluted share, or 7%, from adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $5.48 in 2016. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to higher adjusted income from continuing operations. Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $536 million includes favorable currency translation adjustments of $525 million and an $11 million favorable impact in the funded status of retirement obligations. The favorable translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, Euro, and Korean won. Favorable currency translation adjustments included $232 million in Asia, $153 million in North America and $106 million in Europe partially offset by unfavorable currency translation adjustments of $35 million in South America. The increase in the funded status of retirement obligations was primarily the result of lower current year actuarial losses, as the impact of lower U.S. discount rates was largely offset by a higher actual return on assets. Refer to the Currency section of the MD&A and Notes 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.The number of employees at December 31, 2017 was 26,461, a decrease of 37 employees from December 31, 2016. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of cost reduction programs implemented during the previous year.Other Financial DataEBITDA increased $265 million to $3,675 million in 2017 from $3,410 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $221 million to $3,727 million in 2017 from $3,506 million in 2016 driven by higher adjusted income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization versus the prior year.See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for definitions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported amounts.31Table of ContentsRelated Party TransactionsThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.Environmental MattersLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. Climate ChangeLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions, and Linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, GHGs are regulated in the European Union under the Emissions Trading System, which has wide implications for the company's customers and may impact certain operations of Linde in Europe. There are also requirements for mandatory reporting in Canada, which apply to certain Linde operations and will be used in developing cap-and-trade regulations on GHG emissions. These regulations are expected to impact certain Linde facilities in Canada. Climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies are also being widely introduced in jurisdictions throughout South America, Mexico and parts of Asia. China has announced plans to launch a national carbon emissions trading system, though it does not appear the regulations will have a direct impact on GHG emissions from Linde facilities. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the costs of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of Climate Change regulation.Linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business, as hydrogen is essential to refineries that use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the United States and fuel standards in other regions. Hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.To manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. Linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize its own energy use and GHG footprint through rigorous energy efficiency, investment in renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. At the same time, Linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions, including GHG emissions, in 32Table of ContentsLinde's processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California may create a market for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.Costs Relating to the Protection of the EnvironmentEnvironmental protection costs in 2018 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2018, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.Retirement BenefitsPensionsThe net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. and International pension plans was $24 million in 2018, $58 million in 2017 and $51 million in 2016. The net periodic pension cost for 2018 includes a benefit of $44 million related to gains on settlements triggered as part of the Praxair European business divestiture and recognized on the Net gain on sale of businesses line. This also includes settlement charges related to lump sum payments (e.g., triggered by change in control or normal retirements) of $14 million in 2018. Settlement charges for 2017 and 2016 were $2 million and $4 million, respectively. The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $556 million as of December 31, 2018 versus a deficit of $560 million at December 31, 2017. Actuarial gains on favorable liability experience that arose during the current year related primarily to higher discount rates and were largely offset by a lower return on assets. The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for international plans was a deficit of $1,241 million as of December 31, 2018 versus a deficit of $158 million at December 31, 2017. The deficit is primarily due to the Linde AG merger. Linde' AG's major international pension arrangements are in the United Kingdom and Germany. Global pension contributions were $87 million in 2018, $19 million in 2017 and $11 million in 2016. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2019 are currently expected to be in the range of $95 million to $160 million.Linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2019 of 7.50% and 5.00% for the U.S. and international plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected return on its investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of any settlements, 2019 consolidated pension expense is expected to be $6 million. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (""OPEB"")The net periodic benefit cost for OPEB plans was a $4 million cost in 2018, a $13 million benefit in 2017 and a $5 million cost in 2016. 2017 includes a curtailment gain on a South American OPEB plan of $18 million.In 2019, consolidated net periodic benefit costs for the OPEB plans is expected to be approximately $5 million.Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status.InsuranceLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers’ compensation. Currently, the company self-retains up to $5 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability in the United States and retains up to $5 million per 33Table of Contentsoccurrence at its various properties worldwide. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the company had recorded a total of $60 million and $35 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company’s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.Linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.34Table of ContentsSEGMENT DISCUSSIONThrough October 31, 2018 the company’s operations were organized into five reportable segments, four of which have been determined on a geographic basis of segmentation: North America, Europe, South America and Asia. The company’s surface technologies business represents the fifth reportable segment. These segments are comprised of Praxair businesses for all years presented. As discussed above in the section ""Business Overview - Merger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG"" Linde AG became a separate sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on October 31, 2018 and, accordingly, Linde AG’s operations were included in the consolidated financial statements effective from the merger date (see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).The following summary of sales and operating profit by segment provides a basis for the discussion that follows (for additional information concerning Linde’s segments, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Linde evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating profit, excluding the items not indicative of ongoing business trends.

For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde’s results of operations in any given period.To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of2018ConsolidatedSales Statements of Income Balance Sheets Average Year Ended December 31, December 31,Currency2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Euro16% 0.85 0.89 0.90 0.87 0.83Brazilian real7% 3.63 3.19 3.47 3.87 3.31Chinese yuan7% 6.60 6.76 6.64 6.88 6.51Canadian dollar6% 1.30 1.30 1.32 1.36 1.26Mexican peso4% 19.20 18.86 18.65 19.65 19.66Korean won3% 1,100 1,131 1,160 1,111 1,067British pound3% 0.75 0.78 0.74 0.78 0.74Indian rupee3% 68 65 67 70 64Australia dollars1% 1.34 — — 1.42 —Taiwan dollars1% 30.13 30.43 32.25 30.55 29.73Norwegian krone<1% 8.13 8.26 8.39 8.64 8.20Argentina peso (a)<1% 26.19 16.51 14.74 37.70 18.65 (a) Effective July 1, 2018 Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).45Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities Income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests)$4,288 $1,308 $1,538Non-cash charges (credits): Add: Transaction costs and other charges, net of payments (a)40 26 83 Add: Amortization of merger-related inventory step-up368 — — Less: Net gain on sale of businesses (b)(2,923) — — Add: Tax Act income tax charge, net(61) 394 — Add: Depreciation and amortization1,830 1,184 1,122 Add (Less): Deferred income taxes, excluding Tax Act(187) 136 (13) Add (Less): non-cash charges and other 237 102 (4) Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash charges and other3,592 3,150 2,726Less: Pension contributions(87) (19) (11)Add (Less): Working capital202 (158) 52Add (Less): Other(53) 68 22Net cash provided by operating activities$3,654 $3,041 $2,789Investing Activities Capital expenditures$(1,883) $(1,311) $(1,465)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired(25) (33) (363)Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested5,908 30 58Cash acquired in merger transaction1,363 — —Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$5,363 $(1,314) $(1,770)Financing Activities Debt increases (decreases) – net$(2,908) $(771) $357Issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares – net(522) 108 (89)Cash dividends – Linde plc shareholders(1,166) (901) (856)Noncontrolling interest transactions and other(402) (92) (71)Net cash (used) for financing$(4,998) $(1,656) $(659) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash$(60) $22 $17Cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period$4,466 $617 $524 ____________________(a)See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.(b)See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Cash increased $3,849 million in 2018 versus 2017. The primary sources of cash in 2018 were cash flows from operations of $3,654 million, proceeds from divestitures and asset sales of $5,908 million and cash acquired in the merger of $1,363 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $1,883 million, cash dividends to shareholders of $1,166 million, net debt repayments of $2,908 million and net purchases of ordinary shares of $522 million.46Table of ContentsCash Flows From Operations 2018 compared with 2017Cash flows from operations was $3,654 million, or 25% of sales, an increase of $613 million from $3,041 million, or 27% of sales in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the merger, higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and favorable working capital requirements, partially offset by unfavorable changes in other long–term assets and liabilities and higher pension contributions.2017 compared with 2016Cash flows from operations was $3,041 million, or 27% of sales, an increase of $252 million from $2,789 million, or 26% of sales in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges, a $103 million increase in dividends received from equity companies, primarily in China, and favorable changes in other long–term assets and liabilities which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements and pension contributions. 47Table of ContentsInvesting2018 compared with 2017Net cash used provided by investing activities of $5,363 million increased $6,677 million from 2017 primarily driven by proceeds from the divestiture of Praxair's European business and cash acquired in the merger, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.Capital expenditures in 2018 were $1,883 million, an increase of $572 million from 2017, driven primarily by the merger with Linde AG. Capital expenditures during 2018 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth and density. Approximately 50% of the capital expenditures were in North America with the rest in Asia, Europe, South America and Linde AG.Acquisition expenditures in 2018 were $25 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2017. Additionally, $1,363 million of cash was acquired in the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2018 totaled $5,908 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures including $5,562 million from the sale of Praxair's European business and $214 million related to the sale of Praxair's Italian joint venture (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).2017 compared with 2016Net cash used for investing activities of $1,314 million decreased $456 million versus 2016 due to lower acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by lower proceeds from divestiture and asset sales.Capital expenditures in 2017 were $1,311 million, a decrease of $154 million from 2016. Capital expenditures during 2017 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth and density. Approximately 60% of the capital expenditures were in North America with the rest in Asia, Europe and South America.Acquisition expenditures in 2017 were $33 million, a decrease of $330 million from 2016. Acquisitions in the prior year were primarily comprised of the acquisition of a European carbon dioxide business and packaged gases businesses in North America and Europe (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).Divestitures and asset sales in 2017 totaled $30 million of proceeds from asset sales. 2016 divestitures and asset sales were $58 million which included proceeds from asset sales and the sale of an ownership interest in a majority-owned joint venture in India.48Table of ContentsFinancingLinde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and inter-company funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).Cash used by financing activities was $4,998 million in 2018 compared to $1,656 million in 2017. The primary financing uses of cash were for net debt repayments, cash dividends and net purchases of Linde ordinary shares. Cash dividends of $1,166 million increased $265 million from 2017 driven primarily by higher shares outstanding after the merger and a 5% increase in dividends per share from $3.15 to $3.30. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $522 million in 2018 versus net issuances of ordinary shares of $108 million in 2017 driven by increased share repurchases. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other payments was $402 million in 2018 versus $92 million in 2017. Amounts paid in 2018 include $315 million for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Praxair's Italian joint venture in a merger-related transaction (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and $25 million in interest related to the early redemption of bonds (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements); while 2017 include dividends paid to NCI joint venture partners and repayment of project advances. The cash used for debt repayments-net of $2,908 million increased $2,137 million from $771 million during 2017 while cash increased $3,849 million. Net debt (debt minus cash) increased $2,447 million primarily due to debt acquired in the merger partially offset by the repayments of debt and increased cash.The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. In March 2019, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt repayments in 2018, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 14 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.Linde’s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $10,830 million, $2,447 million higher than $8,383 million at December 31, 2017. The December 31, 2018 net debt balance includes $14,258 million in public securities, $1,038 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings net of $4,466 million of cash. Linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 1.96% for 2018.In March 2018, Linde repaid $500 million of 1.20% notes that became due and in November 2018, Linde repaid $475 million of 1.25% notes that became due. Additionally, in December 2018, Linde repaid $600 million of 4.50% notes due 2019 and €600 million of 1.50% notes due 2020 resulting in a $26 million interest charge ($20 million after-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).Also in December 2018, Linde repaid €750 million of 3.125% notes that became due.In February 2019, Linde repaid $500 million of 1.90% notes that became due.In June 2018, the company's $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks expired and was not renewed. On December 10, 2018 the company announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, of which $629 million had been repurchased through December 31, 2018. This program was completed in February of 2019. On January 22, 2019, the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares with a stated expiration date of February 1, 2021. For additional information related to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table sets forth Linde’s material contract obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018: 49Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Due or expiring by December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt obligations: Debt and capitalized lease maturities (Note 13)$1,523 $1,642 $1,864 $2,336 $1,788 $4,658 $13,811Contractual interest315 283 232 169 141 621 1,761Operating leases (Note 6)305 236 186 145 102 326 1,300Retirement obligations245 29 30 31 31 180 546Unconditional purchase obligations 842 767 721 675 583 3,267 6,855Construction commitments2,100 902 249 4 — — 3,255Total Contractual Obligations$5,330 $3,859 $3,282 $3,360 $2,645 $9,052 $27,528Contractual interest on long-term debt of $1,761 million represents interest the company is contracted to pay on outstanding long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, calculated on a basis consistent with planned debt maturities, excluding the interest impact of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2018, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,565 million and floating-rate debt of $2,731 million. The rate assumed for floating-rate debt was the rate in effect at December 31, 2018.Retirement obligations of $546 million include estimates of pension plan contributions and expected future benefit payments for unfunded pension and OPEB plans. Pension plan contributions are forecasted for 2019 only. For purposes of the table, $125 million of estimated required contributions have been included for 2019. Expected future unfunded pension and OPEB benefit payments are forecasted only through 2028. Contribution and unfunded benefit payment estimates are based upon current valuation assumptions. Estimates of pension contributions after 2019 and unfunded benefit payments after 2028 are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Retirement obligations are more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.Unconditional purchase obligations of $6,855 million represent contractual commitments under various long and short-term take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers and are not included on Linde's balance sheet. These obligations are primarily minimum-purchase commitments for helium, electricity, natural gas and feedstock used to produce atmospheric and process gases. A significant portion of these obligations is passed on to customers through similar take-or-pay or other contractual arrangements. Purchase obligations that are not passed along to customers through such contractual arrangements are subject to market conditions, but do not represent a material risk to Linde. Approximately $2,224 million of the purchase obligations relates to power and is intended to secure the uninterrupted supply of electricity and feedstock to Linde's plants to reliably satisfy customer product supply obligations, and extend through 2030. Certain of the power contracts contain various cancellation provisions requiring supplier agreement, and many are subject to annual escalations based on local inflation factors. Construction commitments of $3,255 million represent outstanding commitments to complete authorized construction projects as of December 31, 2018. A significant portion of Linde’s capital spending is related to the construction of new production facilities to satisfy customer commitments which may take a year or more to complete.Liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $367 million, including interest and penalties, and tax liabilities for deemed repatriation of earnings of $291 million are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2018, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows 50Table of Contentscould be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde’s Audit Committee.Purchase AccountingAs discussed below, Linde AG’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger on a preliminary basis. Estimates of fair value represent management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties. In determining the fair value, Linde utilized various forms of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value includes significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables and others. Inputs were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the preliminary estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Due to the timing of the business combination, the magnitude of and multi-national nature of the net assets acquired, and the hold separate order (See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) which deferred integration of the two merged companies, at December 31, 2018 the valuation process to determine the fair values is not complete and further adjustments are expected in 2019. The company has estimated the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information becomes available. The areas where the fair value assessments are not finalized and, therefore, subject to adjustment during the measurement period relate primarily to identifiable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, net assets held for sale, equity investments, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, contingencies and goodwill. As the company finalizes the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price allocation adjustments will be recorded during the measurement period, but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. The company will reflect measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Any adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired will be offset to goodwill and any income statement impacts will be recorded at that time. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciable Lives of Property, Plant and EquipmentLinde’s net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2018 was $29,717 million, representing 32% of the company’s consolidated total assets and including $19,491 million of Linde AG assets acquired at fair value in the merger. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,615 million, or 13% of total operating costs. This includes $225 million of purchase accounting impacts. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on-site customers. Circumstances and events relating to these assets, such as on-site contract modifications, are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see “Asset Impairments”) are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Linde’s largest asset values relate to cryogenic air-separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years.Based upon the assets as of December 31, 2018, if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annualized depreciation expense, including Linde AG for a full year on a pro forma basis, would be decreased by approximately $528 million or increased by approximately $390 million, respectively.See Notes 3, 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Amortization of Other Intangible AssetsLinde’s net other intangible assets at December 31, 2018 was $16,223 million, representing 17% of the company’s consolidated total assets and including $15,636 million of Linde AG other intangible assets acquired at fair value in the merger ($13,967 million with finite lives and $1,669 million with indefinite lives). Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $215 million, or 2% of total operating costs. This 51Table of Contentsincludes $121 million of purchase accounting impacts. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated amortizable lives that are used to calculate the annual amortization expense and accumulated amortization. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Based upon the assets as of December 31, 2018, if amortization lives of other intangible assets, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annualized amortization expense, including Linde AG for a full year on a pro forma basis, would be decreased by approximately $65 million or increased by approximately $49 million, respectively.See Notes 3, 9, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Revenue RecognitionLong Term Construction Contracts The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Pension BenefitsPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year (e.g., settlement gains from divestitures, settlement charges resulting from change in control provisions, etc.).The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.62% for U.S. plans and 5.13% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2018 (8.00% and 7.91%, respectively at December 31, 2017). The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $38 million.The company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $8,530 million, or $286 million higher than the fair value of assets of $8,244 million at December 31, 2018. These net deferred investment gains of $286 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.Discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. For fiscal year 2016, Praxair changed the approach that it used to determine the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant plans to the spot rate approach. Linde AG also adopted the spot 52Table of Contentsrate approach for its material U.S. and international pension plans as of the merger date. Under this approach U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2018 benefit costs. A 0.50% change in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would decrease/increase Linde’s pension expense by approximately $24 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $806 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $710 million. The weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.38% for international plans at December 31, 2018 (3.25% and 3.35%, respectively, at December 31, 2017). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $8 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $60 million.Asset ImpairmentsGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles AssetsAt December 31, 2018, the company had goodwill of $26,874 million, of which $24,320 million was recorded in connection with the Linde AG merger, and $1,669 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in the merger. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated. The company has continuously re-evaluated the likelihood of goodwill impairments in its reporting units subsequent to the second quarter test, and does not believe there is indication of impairment for any of its reporting units. At December 31, 2018, Linde’s enterprise value was approximately $96 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $68 billion.The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. Fair value is determined through the use of projected future cash flows, multiples of earnings and sales and other factors. Such analysis requires the use of certain market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. As applicable, estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company's control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, and technological changes. Management believes that the qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2018 qualitative assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.See Notes 3, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which 53Table of Contentsthere are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model, for property, plant and equipment an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. Income TaxesAt December 31, 2018, Linde had deferred tax assets of $2,039 million (net of valuation allowances of $237 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $8,961 million. At December 31, 2018, uncertain tax positions totaled $319 million (see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $817 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or about 16.2% of pre-tax income (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions. The company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.In 2018, Linde completed its accounting and updated its provisional estimate related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 118 resulting in a net reduction to income tax expense of $61 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). A provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently reinvested.ContingenciesThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.Linde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.54Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company’s financial leverage and operating performance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2018. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2018, Linde had debt totaling $15,296 million ($9,000 million at December 31, 2017). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2018, including the impact of derivatives Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,565 million and floating-rate debt of $2,731 million, representing 82% and 18%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2017, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $8,253 million and floating-rate debt of $747 million, representing 92% and 8%, respectively, of total debt. Fixed Rate DebtIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2018, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one-percentage-point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $594 million ($450 million in 2017). A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $92 million increase to derivative assets recorded.Variable Rate DebtAt December 31, 2018, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one-percentage point increase in interest rates, including the offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $24 million. At December 31, 2017 the impact of a one-percentage point increase was $6 million, holding all other variables constant. Foreign Currency RiskLinde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in South America (primarily Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom), Canada, Mexico, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia, China, India, and Korea) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2018, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $9,412 million ($2,693 million at December 31, 2017) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Holding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% adverse change in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 would decrease by approximately $307 million and $174 million, respectively, which would be largely offset by an offsetting gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.59Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Subsequent Events13360Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLinde’s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.Linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has completed an audit of Linde’s 2018, 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) as stated in their report.The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGLinde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.Linde’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 did not include the internal control over financial reporting related to Linde AG because the business was acquired in a merger accounted for as a business combination consummated during 2018. Total assets and sales for Linde AG represent approximately 26.4% and 19.3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 as stated in their report. /s/ STEPHEN F.

WhiteChief Financial Officer March 18, 201961Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plcOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Linde Aktiengesellschaft (“Linde AG”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 because the business was acquired in a merger accounted for as a business combination consummated during 2018. We have also excluded Linde AG from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Linde AG is a subsidiary whose total assets and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 26.4% and 19.3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.62Table of ContentsDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Stamford, ConnecticutMarch 18, 2019We have served as the Company’s or its predecessor auditor since 1992. 63Table of

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. FORMATION OF LINDE PLC AND BUSINESS COMBINATION OF PRAXAIR, INC. AND LINDE AGFormation of Linde plcLinde plc (""Linde"" or “the company”), a public limited company incorporated in Ireland, was formed in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated as of June 1, 2017, as amended (the “business combination agreement”). Pursuant to the business combination agreement, among other things, Praxair, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Praxair”), and Linde Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Germany (“Linde AG”), agreed to combine their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of the company (collectively referred to as “business combination” or “merger”). On October 31, 2018, Linde plc completed the business combination. Prior to the business combination, the company did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the business combination agreement. Business Combination of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AGThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 805, “Business Combinations”, with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, as of October 31, 2018, the company became the successor issuer to Praxair. Also, the Linde plc shares are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LIN”. Prior to the business combination, the Praxair shares were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE. In connection with the completion of the business combination, the Praxair shares were suspended from trading on the NYSE as of close of business (New York Time) on October 30, 2018. On November 1, 2018, Praxair filed a Form 25 to delist and deregister its three series of Euro-denominated notes, including its 1.50% Notes due 2020, 1.20% Notes due 2024 and 1.625% Notes due 2025, that were listed on the NYSE. Trading of the Euro-denominated notes on the NYSE was suspended as of close of business (New York Time) on November 9, 2018, and Praxair filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration under the Exchange Act of its securities and suspending Praxair’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements included the sale of the majority of Praxair’s European businesses (subsequently completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG’s America’s business (subsequently completed on March 1, 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are expected to be sold in 2019 (collectively, the “merger-related divestitures”). See Note 4 for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures. To obtain merger approval in the United States. Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission dated October 1, 2018 (“hold separate order” or “HSO”). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to (i) continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other’s operations; (ii) not coordinate any aspect of the operations of Linde AG and Praxair, including the marketing or sale of any products; and (iii) maintain separate financial ledgers, books, and records that report on a periodic basis, consistent with past practices, the assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues, and income of each, until certain divestitures in the United States have been completed. The restrictions under the hold separate order were lifted March 1, 2019, concurrent with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the United States.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("" U.S. GAAP"") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Equity income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. 71Table of ContentsPre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations (""LLC"") is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have incurred. Operations less than 20% owned, where the company does not exercise significant influence, are generally carried at cost.Changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.Operations – Linde is the largest industrial gases company worldwide. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases, and high-performance surface coatings to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde’s Engineering Division offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including suppling plant components and services directly to customers.Revenue Recognition – Effective January 1, 2018, Linde adopted the FASB's Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (""ASC 606"") relating to Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. Refer to footnote 21 for additional details regarding Linde revenue recognition policies. Prior to adoption of ASC 606 revenue was recognized when a firm sales agreement exists, collectability of a fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured, and when title and risks of ownership transfer to the customer for product sales or, in the case of other revenues when obligations are satisfied or services are performed. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in no differences in revenue recognition compared to previous policies.Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment – Net – Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities (see Note 10). Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 10). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.The company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.Asset-Retirement Obligations – An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at discounted fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company’s asset-retirement obligations are primarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation – For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 9). Financial Instruments – Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.72Table of ContentsThere are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to anticipated net income and currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.See Note 14 for additional information relating to financial instruments.Goodwill – Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The applicable guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. As applicable, fair value is determined through the use of projected future cash flows, multiples of earnings and sales and other factors. Such analysis requires the use of certain market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature.See Notes 3 and 11 for additional information relating to goodwill.Other Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and brands/tradenames, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred. See Notes 3 and 12 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – Assets held for sale, as well as liabilities directly related to these assets, are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets as held for sale if the requirements of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are satisfied. The main requirements of ASC 360 are: (i) management having the authority to approve the action has committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (ii) the assets are available for sale in their present condition at a reasonable market price, and (iii) a sale within the next twelve months is probable. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Amortization and depreciation has been 73Table of Contentsdiscontinued. The process involved in determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.Discontinued operations are reported as soon as a business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and when the business to be disposed of represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the company’s operations and financial results. Businesses acquired with the intent of divesting are also required to be reported as discontinued operations. The profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations. The information provided in the Notes relates to continuing operations. If the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted accordingly.See Note 4 for additional information relating to assets held for sale and discontinued operations.Income Taxes – Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.Under the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. See Note 7 for additional information relating to income taxes, including the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.Retirement Benefits – Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees’ expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices. See Note 18 for additional information relating to retirement programs.Share-based Compensation– The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. See Note 17 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.Reclassifications – Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation, including reclassifications on the consolidated statements of income and segment operating profit relating to the adoption of accounting guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs.As a result of the merger, certain reclassifications of prior period amounts were made to improve comparability and conform with the current presentation. Presentation changes were made to the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, certain reclassifications of prior period data were made in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform with the current period presentation. These reclassifications include: (i) the reclassification of capitalized software from property plant and equipment - net to other intangibles - net (see Note 10), and (ii) the reclassification of VAT receivables and VAT payables from accounts receivable and accounts payable, respectively, to other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, (see Note 9). Recently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Implemented in 2018 The following standards were effective for Linde in 2018 and their adoption did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements:74Table of Contents•Revenue Recognition – In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued updated guidance on the reporting and disclosure of revenue. Effective January 1, 2018, Linde has adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective transition method. No material differences in revenue recognition accounting were identified under the new guidance compared with the company's historic revenue recognition accounting (see Note 21).•Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments – In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The update provides accounting guidance for specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements.•Intra-Entity Asset Transfers – In October 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for income tax accounting of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The update requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory in the period when the transfer occurs. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements.•Pension Costs - In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires the service cost component be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and not included within operating profit. This guidance was adopted in the first quarter 2018. Accordingly, non-service related components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs were reclassified out of ""Operating Profit"" to ""Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost"" using the practical expedient to use the amounts disclosed in the retirement benefits note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements (see Note 18). •Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income – In February 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a reclassification adjustment of $93 million.Accounting Standards to be Implemented•Leases – In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting and financial statement presentation of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, except those that meet certain scope exceptions, and would require expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2019 and requires companies to transition using a modified retrospective approach. Linde has implemented a new application to administer the accounting and disclosure requirements and is finalizing its determination of the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.•Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – In June 2016, the FASB issued an update on the measurement of credit losses. The guidance introduces a new accounting model for expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on estimates of current expected credit losses. This guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter 2019 and requires companies to apply the change in accounting on a prospective basis. The company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements.•Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment – In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 with early adoption permitted. The company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.•Derivatives and Hedging - In August 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for hedging activities. The new guidance changes both the designation and measurement for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This guidance will be effective for the company 75Table of Contentsbeginning in the first quarter 2019. The company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.76Table of ContentsNOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONSMerger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AGAs described in Note 1, on October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company. In connection with the business combination, each share of common stock of Praxair par value $0.01 per share, (excluding any shares held in treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which were automatically canceled and retired for no consideration) was converted into one ordinary share, par value €0.001 per share, of Linde plc. Additionally, each tendered share of common stock of Linde AG was converted into 1.54 ordinary shares of Linde plc. As provided in the business combination agreement, at the effective time of the business combination outstanding Praxair stock options and other equity awards were generally converted into stock options and equity awards on a 1:1 basis with respect to Linde shares. Outstanding Linde AG share-based compensation awards were either settled in cash (for the portion vested), or are required to be converted into similar stock options and equity awards with respect to Linde shares (for the portion unvested), after giving effect to the 1.54 exchange ratio. This grant is expected to occur in the first half of 2019. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information.Preliminary Allocation of Purchase PriceIn accordance with the FASB’s ASC 805, ""Business Combinations"", Praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer. As such, the company has applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Linde AG, which have been measured at estimated fair value as of the date of the business combination.In accordance with the business combination agreement, Linde AG shareholders that accepted the exchange offer received Linde shares in exchange for Linde AG shares at an exchange ratio of 1.54 Linde shares for each Linde AG share. Because Praxair is the accounting acquirer, the fair value of the equity issued by Linde plc to Linde AG shareholders in the exchange transaction was determined by reference to the market price of Praxair shares. Accordingly, the purchase consideration below reflects the estimated fair value of the 92% of Linde AG shares tendered and Linde shares issued in exchange for those Linde AG shares, which is based on the final closing price of Praxair shares prior to the effective time of the merger on October 31, 2018 of $164.50 per share. The purchase price and estimated fair value of Linde AG’s net assets acquired as of the merger date on October 31, 2018 is presented as follows: (in thousands, except value per share data, Linde AG exchange ratio, and purchase price)Linde AG common stock tendered as of October 31, 2018 (i)170,875 SharesBusiness combination agreement exchange ratio (ii)1.54 : 1Linde plc ordinary shares issued in exchange for Linde AG263,148Per share price of Praxair, Inc. common stock (iii)$164.50Purchase price (millions of dollars)$43,288 (i)Number of Linde AG shares tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offer. (ii)Exchange ratio for Linde AG shares as set forth in the business combination agreement. (iii)Closing price of Praxair shares on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the effective time of the business combination on October 31, 2018.In accordance with ASC 805, Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair values at October 31, 2018, primarily using Level 3 inputs except debt which was Level 1. Estimates of fair value represent management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables, and others. Inputs used were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Linde, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Linde AG’s net assets recorded as goodwill. Due to the timing of the business combination, the magnitude of and multi-national nature of the net assets acquired, and the hold separate order (See Note 1) which deferred integration of the two merged companies, at December 31, 77Table of Contents2018 the valuation process to determine the fair values is not complete and further adjustments are expected in 2019. The company has estimated the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information becomes available, analysis is able to be performed, refinement of market participant assumptions, finalization of tax returns in the pre-merger period and the application of push-down accounting at the subsidiary level. The areas where the fair value assessments are not finalized and, therefore, subject to adjustment during the measurement period relate primarily to identifiable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, net assets held for sale, equity investments, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, contingencies and goodwill. As the company finalizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price allocation adjustments will be recorded during the measurement period, but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. The company will reflect measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Therefore, final determination of the fair values will likely result in further adjustments to the values presented in the following table: Millions of dollarsEstimated Fair ValueAssets Cash and cash equivalents$1,363Accounts receivable – net2,859Inventories1,452Assets held for sale5,180Prepaid and other current assets1,251Property, plant and equipment19,381Equity investments1,395Goodwill24,146Other intangible assets15,592Other long-term assets1,024Total Assets Acquired$73,643Less: Liabilities Assumed Accounts payable$3,360Short-term debt1,177Current portion of long-term debt1,864Accrued taxes159Liabilities of assets held for sale676Other current liabilities3,016Long-term debt6,295Other long-term liabilities1,908Deferred credits, including deferred income taxes6,754Total Liabilities Assumed$25,209Less: Noncontrolling Interests5,146Purchase Price (i)$43,288 (i)See above for the calculation of the purchase price. Summary of Significant Fair Value MethodsThe methods used to determine the fair value of significant identifiable assets and liabilities included in the preliminary allocation of purchase price are discussed below.InventoriesAcquired inventory is comprised of finished goods, work in process and raw materials. The fair value of finished goods was calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for costs of the selling effort and a reasonable profit allowance relating 78Table of Contentsto the selling effort. The fair value of work in process inventory was primarily calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for estimated costs to complete the manufacturing, estimated costs of the selling effort, as well as a reasonable profit margin on the remaining manufacturing and selling effort. The fair value of raw materials and supplies was determined based on replacement cost which approximates historical carrying value. The preliminary fair value step-up of inventories is being recognized in “Cost of sales” as the inventory is sold. Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for saleAs described in Note 1, as a condition of the European Commission (""EC""), the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ""), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, Linde plc, Praxair and Linde AG were required to divest various businesses in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The fair value of these businesses has been determined based on the estimated net selling prices or sales agreements. Actual amounts may differ from this preliminary determination. See Note 4 for further information on merger-related divestitures.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe fair value of property, plant and equipment was primarily calculated using replacement costs adjusted for the age and condition of the asset, and is summarized below:Property, plant and equipment (""PP&E"")(in millions)Production plants$10,739Storage tanks1,809Transportation equipment and other574Cylinders2,493Buildings1,970Land and improvements647Construction in progress1,149Preliminary fair value of PP&E$19,381The final fair value determination for property, plant and equipment or estimates of remaining useful lives may differ from this preliminary determination. Identifiable Intangible AssetsThe fair value of identifiable intangible assets is summarized below: Weighted Average Amortization Period (in years) (in millions)Identifiable intangible assets Customer relationships27 $12,555 Linde BrandIndefinite 1,648 Brands/Tradenames27 578 Other intangibles8 811Preliminary fair value of identifiable intangible assets26 $15,592The fair value estimate for all other identifiable intangible assets is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The final fair value determination for identifiable intangibles or estimates of remaining useful lives may differ materially from this preliminary determination.The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from Linde AG’s existing customer base. Excess earnings are the earnings remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated values of contributory assets, including debt-free net working capital, tangible assets, and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess earnings are thereby calculated for each year of multi-year projection periods and discounted to present value.79Table of ContentsBrands/Tradenames includes $1,648 million related to the Linde brand which is considered to have an indefinite life. Other intangibles primarily includes acquired technology. These intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty method under the income approach; this method estimates the cost savings generated by a company related to the ownership of an asset for which it would otherwise have had to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset and discounted to present value.Pension and Other Postretirement LiabilitiesLinde recognized a pretax net liability representing the unfunded portion of Linde AG’s defined-benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (""OPEB"") plans. Refer to Note 18 for further information on pensions and OPEB arrangements.Long-Term DebtThe fair value for long-term debt was primarily obtained from third party quotes, as the majority of the Linde AG bond portfolio is publicly traded. Deferred Income Tax Assets and LiabilitiesThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities include the expected future federal, state and foreign tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the respective tax bases. Tax rates utilized in calculating deferred income taxes generally represent the enacted statutory tax rates at the effective date of the merger in the jurisdictions in which legal title of the underlying asset or liability resides. The final fair value of deferred income tax assets and liabilities may differ from this preliminary determination. Refer to Note 7 for further information related to income taxes. Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests include the fair value of noncontrolling interests of Linde AG, including approximately $3.2 billion relating to the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and are intended to be the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out. The company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Linde Intermediate Holding AG ""Linde Holding""), which directly owns the 92% of Linde AG shares acquired in the Exchange Offer, determined the adequate cash compensation to be paid to the 8% remaining Linde AG minority shareholders in exchange for the transfer of their Linde AG shares for each Linde AG share. The cash-merger squeeze-out was approved by the shareholders of Linde AG at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Linde AG on December 12, 2018, but remains subject to court approval. Also, as required by German law, a guarantee was obtained from a financial institution guaranteeing the fulfillment of Linde Holding's obligations to pay the minority shareholders of Linde AG all amounts due in connection with the squeeze-out transaction. The remaining noncontrolling interests relate to the fair value of historic noncontrolling interests of Linde AG and its subsidiaries. The final fair value determination for noncontrolling interests may differ from this preliminary determination.Equity InvestmentsThe fair value of equity investments was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. The final fair value of equity investments may differ from this preliminary determination. Other Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed (excluding Goodwill) Linde utilized the carrying values, net of allowances, to value accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable as well as other current assets and liabilities as it was determined that carrying values represented the fair value of those items at the merger date. GoodwillThe excess of the consideration for the merger over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The merger resulted in the recognition of $24,146 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and cost and other operating synergies anticipated upon the integration of the operations of Praxair and Linde AG. The push down of goodwill to reporting units is not final and may differ from this preliminary determination. Results of Linde AG Operations Since Merger The results of operations of Linde AG have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of income since the merger. The following table provides Linde AG “Sales” and “Income (loss) from continuing operations” included in the company's results since the merger.80Table of ContentsMillions of dollarsLinde AG Results of OperationsNovember 1, - December 31, 2018Sales$2,873Income (loss) from continuing operations*$(385)* Includes net charges of $451 million related to the impacts of purchase accounting.Unaudited Pro Forma InformationLinde's unaudited pro forma results presented below were prepared pursuant to the requirements of ASC 805 and give effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only, and do not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2017. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future operating results and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved.The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments for the preliminary purchase accounting impact (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired tangible and intangible assets, amortization of the fair value adjustment to investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and reduction of interest expense related to the fair value adjustment to long-term debt along with the related tax and non-controlling interest impacts), the alignment of accounting policies, adjustments due to IFRS compliant reporting conversion to U.S. GAAP and the elimination of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG. The unaudited pro forma results for all periods presented below exclude the results of operations of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures (See Note 4) as these divestitures are reflected as discontinued operations. The Praxair merger-related divestitures (See Note 4) are included in the results from continuing operations, including the results from Praxair's European business through the disposition date of December 3, 2018, in the unaudited pro forma results presented below, for all periods presented, as these divestitures do not qualify for discontinued operations. The unaudited pro forma results are summarized below:Millions of dollars2018 2017Sales (a)$29,774 $28,449Income from continuing operations$4,739 $871(a) Includes sales from Praxair's merger-related divestitures of $1,625 million and $1,553 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Significant nonrecurring amounts reflected in the pro forma results are as follows:A $3,294 million gain ($2,923 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business and is included in the December 31, 2018 pro forma income from continuing operations. From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG collectively incurred pre-tax costs of $736 million ($680 million after tax) to prepare for and close the merger. These merger costs were reflected within the results of operations in the pro forma results as if they were incurred on January 1, 2017. Any costs incurred related to merger-related divestitures and integration and to prepare for the intended business separations were reflected in the pro forma results in the period in which they were incurred.The company incurred pre-tax charges of $368 million ( $279 million after tax) and $10 million ($8 million after tax) in 2018 related to the fair value step‑up of inventories acquired and sold as well as a pension settlement due to the payout to certain participants as a result of change in control provisions within a U.S. nonqualified pension plan, respectively. The 2018 pro forma results were adjusted to exclude these charges. The pro forma results for 2017 were adjusted to include these charges, as well as charges incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018 but less than a year from the date of the merger of $13 million ($10 million after tax) related to the remaining fair value step-up of inventories to be sold and $51 million ($40 million after tax) related to an additional pension settlement within the U.S. nonqualified pension plan will occur in the first quarter of 2019 upon payment. See Note 18 for further information relating to the U.S. nonqualified pension plan settlements. 81Table of Contents2018 Non-Merger Related AcquisitionsNon-merger related acquisitions of $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 are not material individually or in the aggregate.2017 AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Linde had acquisitions totaling $33 million, primarily acquisitions of packaged gas businesses and a carbon dioxide joint venture in North America. These transactions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of $24 million and $3 million, respectively (see Notes 11 and 12). 2016 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2016, Linde had acquisitions totaling $363 million, primarily the acquisition of Yara International ASA's European carbon dioxide business (""European CO2 business"") and packaged gases businesses in North America and Europe. These transactions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of $141 million and $82 million, respectively (see Notes 11 and 12). In addition, Linde purchased a remaining 34% share in a Scandinavian joint venture for $104 million (see Note 16). On June 1, 2016 Linde completed an acquisition of a European CO2 business, which is a leading supplier of liquid CO2 and dry ice primarily to the European food and beverage industries. The business operates CO2 liquefaction plants and dry ice production facilities across the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination; accordingly, the results of operations were consolidated from June 1, 2016 in the European business segment. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $230 million (€206 million) and resulted in $121 million of intangible assets. The intangible assets primarily consist of $69 million of goodwill and $51 million of customer relationships that will be amortized over their estimated life of 20 years. This business was subsequently sold as part of the merger Divestitures (see Note 4).NOTE 4. MERGER-RELATED DIVESTITURES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALEAs described in Note 1, as a condition of the European Commission (""EC""), the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ""), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, Linde plc, Praxair and Linde AG were required to divest the following businesses:Praxair Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily European Industrial Gases Business As a condition of the EC regulatory approval of the merger transaction, Praxair agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in Europe. The sale was completed on December 3, 2018 in two transactions, as described below: •The Società Italiana Acetilene e Derivati S.p.A. (""SIAD"") Sale and Purchase Agreement dated December 5, 2017 whereby Praxair agreed, inter alia, to sell its 34% non-controlling participation in its Italian joint venture SIAD to its joint venture partner Flow Fin in exchange for Flow Fin’s 40% non-controlling participation in Praxair’s majority-owned Italian joint venture, Rivoira S.p.A., and cash payment of a net purchase price of €90 million ($102 million as of October 31, 2018) by Praxair to Flow Fin. This transaction was completed on October 31, 2018, and;•The Praxair Europe Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 5, 2018 pursuant to which Praxair sold the majority of its European businesses to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation for €5,000 million in cash consideration ($5,700 million at December 3, 2018), reduced by estimated normal closing adjustments of €86 million ($96 million). These transactions were completed on December 3, 2018.In connection with these transactions, the company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $3,294 million ($2,923 million after tax) in the consolidated statements of income and related to the Europe segment.The net carrying value of Praxair's European business assets and liabilities divested on December 3, 2018 is presented below:82Table of ContentsMillions of dollarsCarrying ValueAssets Cash and cash equivalents$38Accounts receivable – net311Inventories67Prepaid and other current assets22Property, plant and equipment – net1,342Equity investments234Goodwill620Other intangible assets – net115Other long-term assets36Total Assets Divested$2,785Liabilities Accounts payable$215Accrued taxes27Other current liabilities111Long-term debt2Other long-term liabilities92Deferred credits174Total Liabilities Divested$621Noncontrolling interests$200Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) Pension/OPEB funded status obligation, net of taxes(8)Cumulative translation adjustment, net of taxes(318)Net Assets Divested$2,290Additionally, to satisfy regulatory requirements to consummate the business combination, Praxair agreed to the following transactions which will be completed during 2019: •Praxair's Chilean business which will be sold as part of the Americas' SPA (as defined below) for $21 million proceeds which is further described below.•Various transactions within China, India and South Korea. 2018 sales related to these businesses were approximately $160 million.Effective October 22, 2018, the date of final regulatory approvals, these businesses have been accounted for as Assets Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These businesses were evaluated for discontinued operations accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP and it was determined that they did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation as these transactions did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect, after considering the impact of the merger. Linde AG Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily Americas Industrial Gases Business As a condition of the U.S. regulatory approval of the merger, Linde AG agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in the Americas, as described below: •The Linde AG Americas Sales and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as and further amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018, and February 20, 2019 whereby Linde AG and Praxair, Inc. entered into an agreement with a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII to sell the majority of Linde AG’s industrial gases business in North America and certain industrial gases business activities of Linde AG's in South America for $2.97 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities 83Table of Contentsof the sold businesses. In addition, divestitures include $531 million of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the Americas under other agreements. These transactions were completed on March 1, 2019.•Various transactions within China, India and South Korea.Discontinued OperationsOnly the sales of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures meet the criteria for discontinued operations, Praxair merger-related divestitures do not qualify as discontinued operations.

TRANSACTION COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES2018 Charges Transaction costs and other charges were $309 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($306 after-tax and noncontrolling interests, or $0.92 per diluted share). Transaction Costs On October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG combined under Linde plc, as contemplated by the business combination agreement (see Note 1). In connection with the business combination, Linde incurred transaction costs which totaled $236 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($236 million after-tax). Other ChargesAlso included in Transaction costs and other charges are other charges of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($70 million after-tax) comprised of the following; (i) a $40 million charge ($40 million after-tax) related to an unfavorable development related to a supplier contract in China, (ii) restructuring charges of $21 million ($18 million after-tax) and (iii) a $12 million charge ($12 million after-tax) associated with the transition to hyper-inflationary accounting in Argentina.2017 Charges Transaction Costs In connection with the intended business combination, Linde incurred transaction costs which totaled $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 ($48 million after-tax or $0.17 per diluted share). 2016 ChargesCost Reduction Program and Other ChargesIn the third quarter of 2016, Linde recorded pre-tax charges totaling $96 million ($63 million after-tax and noncontrolling interests of $0.22 per diluted share). Following is a summary of the pre-tax charge by reportable segment:(millions of dollars)Severance costs Other Charges TotalNorth America$14 $29 $43Europe12 3 15South America5 7 12Asia6 13 19Surface Technologies3 4 7Total$40 $56 $96The severance costs of $40 million are for the elimination of 730 positions. The other charges of $56 million are primarily related to (i) the consolidation of operations for efficiencies and cost reduction primarily in North America and Surface Technologies, (ii) integration costs for acquisitions in Europe and North America, and (iii) asset write-downs and other charges related to the impacts of weaker underlying industrial activity, primarily in the Americas and Asia. Amounts related to asset write-downs are net of expected sale proceeds, which are not significant.The total cash requirement of the cost reduction program and other charges was approximately $50 million. The actions are completed. Classification in the consolidated financial statements The pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded primarily as short-term liabilities. On the consolidated statement of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 20 - Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.85Table of ContentsNOTE 6. LEASESIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Total lease and rental expenses under operating leases were $193 million in 2018, $146 million in 2017 and $141 million in 2016.

INCOME TAXESThe year ended December 31, 2018 reflects Praxair for the entire year and the Linde AG for the period beginning October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting. The amounts for historical periods prior to 2018 solely reflect the results of Praxair. See Notes 1 and 3. Pre-tax income applicable to U.S. and foreign operations is as follows: (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016United States$931 $1,003 $954Foreign (a)4,118 1,284 1,094Total income before income taxes$5,049 $2,287 $2,048(a) includes a $3,294 million gain related to Europe divestiture (see Notes 4 and 9). U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act)On December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act""). This comprehensive tax legislation significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules by, among other things, lowering the corporate income 86Table of Contentstax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Given the substantial uncertainties surrounding the Tax Act and the short period of time between December 22, 2017 and December 31, 2017 to calculate the U.S. Federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. tax impacts of the Tax Act, at December 31, 2017 the company accounted for its income tax charge on a provisional (estimated) basis as allowed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""). The company’s 2017 net provisional income tax charge of $394 million has three main components: (i) an estimated $467 million U.S. Federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; (ii) an estimated $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated future repatriation of foreign earnings; and (iii) an estimated $333 million deferred tax benefit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the new 21% tax rate. The $467 million U.S. federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings includes $422 million of deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years, of which $388 million is classified as of December 31, 2017 as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 9).During 2018, the company continued to evaluate the Tax Act, additional guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, its historical foreign earnings and taxes and other items that could impact its net provisional tax charge. Additionally, the company continued to review its foreign capital structures, organizational cash needs and the foreign withholding tax cost of planned repatriation. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed its accounting and updated its provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118 resulting in a net reduction to tax expense of $61 million, $41 million U.S. federal and $20 million of state income tax (net of federal tax benefit). This resulted in a deemed repatriation tax payable of $291 million payable over the remaining seven years, of which $265 million is classified as of December 31, 2018 as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 9). Further, the Tax Act enacted new provisions related to the taxation of foreign earnings, known as GILTI. The company has elected as an accounting policy to account for GILTI as period costs when incurred.Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, ""Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"", electing to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI"") to retained earnings. This resulted in a net reduction to AOCI and a net increase to retained earnings of $93 million, $98 million directly related to the federal income tax rate change reduced by $5 million indirectly related to the federal tax rate change on state income taxes.Provision for Income TaxesThe following is an analysis of the provision for income taxes: (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,2018 (a) 2017 (a) 2016Current tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal$390 $565 $266State and local(7) 84 32Foreign620 374 266 1,003 1,023 564Deferred tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal8 (221) 3State and local15 19 7Foreign(209) 205 (23) (186) 3 (13)Total income taxes$817 $1,026 $551 (a)Includes a benefit of $61 million and a charge of $394 million related to the Tax Act in 2018 and 2017, respectively and a charge of $371 million related to divestitures in 2018 (see Note 4) as follows:87Table of Contents 2018 2017Current tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal$219 $414State and local(36) 53Foreign114 60 297 527Deferred tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal6 (333)State and local7 —Foreign— 200 13 (133)Total income taxes$310 $394Effective Tax Rate ReconciliationFor purposes of the effective tax rate reconciliation, the company utilized the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 35% in years 2017 and 2016. An analysis of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income follows: (Dollar amounts in millions)Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016U.S. statutory income tax$1,060 21.0 % $801 35.0 % $717 35.0 %State and local taxes – net of federal benefit30 0.6 % 32 1.4 % 28 1.4 %U.S. tax credits and deductions (a)(12) (0.2)% (27) (1.2)% (32) (1.6)%Foreign tax differentials (b)57 1.1 % (145) (6.3)% (140) (6.8)%Share Based Compensation(22) (0.4)% (35) (1.5)% (20) (1.0)%Tax Act(61) (1.2)% 394 17.2 % — — %Divestitures (c)(321) (6.4)% — — % — — %Other – net (d)86 1.7 % 6 0.3 % (2) (0.1)%Provision for income taxes$817 16.2 % $1,026 44.9 % $551 26.9 % ________________________(a)U.S. tax credits and deductions relate to foreign derived intangible income in 2018, the research and experimentation tax credit in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and manufacturing deduction in years 2017 and 2016.(b)Primarily related to differences between the U.S. tax rate (21% in year 2018 and 35% in years 2017 and 2016) and the statutory tax rate in the countries where the company operates.

After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances. At December 31, 2018, the company had $526 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $237 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $445 million relating to NOLs of which $55 million expire within 5 years, $125 million expire after 5 years and $265 million have no expiration. The deferred tax assets also include $81 million related to credits of which $13 million expire within 5 years, $38 million expire after 5 years, and $30 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $237 million primarily relate to NOLs and are required because management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely 89Table of Contentsthat the NOLs will be utilized before they expire. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.The company has $570 million of foreign income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2018. A provision has not been made for any additional foreign income tax at December 31, 2018 on approximately $30 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $30 billion could become subject to additional foreign income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.Uncertain Tax PositionsUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $319 million, $54 million and $56 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statement of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (Millions of dollars)2018 2017 2016Unrecognized income tax benefits, January 1$54 $56 $68Additions for tax positions of prior years (a)104 48 6Reductions for tax positions of prior years(7) (26) (15)Additions for current year tax positions (b)179 — —Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (c)(3) (26) (2)Foreign currency translation and other(8) 2 (1)Unrecognized income tax benefits, December 31$319 $54 $56 ________________________(a)Increase primarily relates to tax positions in the United States and Europe.(b)2018 includes $167 million related to the merger with Linde AG.(c)Settlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty. The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. The company recognized net interest expense of $32 million in 2018, net interest expense of $8 million in 2017, and net interest income of $10 million in 2016. The company had $48 million and $8 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 9). 90Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2018, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below: Major tax jurisdictionsOpen YearsNorth and South America United States2014 through 2018Canada2011 through 2018Mexico2012 through 2018Brazil2005 through 2018 Europe and Africa Belgium2013 through 2018Germany2011 through 2018Luxembourg2013 through 2018Netherlands2013 through 2018Republic of South Africa2014 through 2018Scandinavia2008 through 2018Spain2004 through 2018United Kingdom2015 through 2018 Asia and Australia Australia2013 through 2018China2008 through 2018India2006 through 2018Korea2013 through 2018New Zealand2014 through 2018Taiwan2014 through 2018The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.91Table of ContentsNOTE 8.

For the 2018 test, Linde applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, Linde concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded. There were no indicators of impairment through December 31, 2018.97NOTE 12.

The $2.5 billion and €2.5 billion credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable by the issuing financial institutions until their respective maturities. There are no financial covenants contained in the agreement relating to the Linde AG €2.5 billion credit facility; the only financial covenant for the senior unsecured $2.5 billion credit facility requires the company not to exceed a maximum 70% leverage ratio. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2018.Covenants Linde’s $2.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility and long-term debt agreements contain various covenants which may, among other things, restrict certain types of mergers and changes in beneficial ownership of the company, and the ability of the company to incur or guarantee debt, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens against assets, enter into sale and leaseback agreements, or pay dividends and make other distributions beyond certain limits. These agreements also require Linde to not exceed a maximum 70% leverage ratio defined in the agreements as the ratio of consolidated total debt to the sum of consolidated total debt plus consolidated shareholders’ equity of the company. For purposes of the leverage ratio calculation, consolidated shareholders’ equity excludes changes in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments after June 30, 2011. At December 31, 2018, the actual leverage ratio, as calculated according to the agreement, was 34% and the company is in compliance with all financial covenants. Also, there are no material adverse change clauses or other subjective conditions that would restrict the company’s ability to borrow under the agreement.Other Debt InformationAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The decrease in the rate year-over-year is related primarily to significant European commercial paper balances at negative interest rates, which offsets the impact of higher rates on other bank borrowings. Expected maturities of long-term debt are as follows:(Millions of dollars) 2019$1,52320201,64220211,86420222,33620231,788Thereafter4,658 $13,811102Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2018, $74 million of Linde’s assets were pledged as collateral for $81 million of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt. The carrying amounts of assets pledged as collateral for long-term debt are disclosed primarily under property, plant, and equipment and are included within buildings and transportation equipment and other. In February 2016, Linde redeemed $325 million of 5.20% notes due March 2017 resulting in a $16 million interest charge ($10 million after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share). See Note 15 for the fair value information related to debt.NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to changes in the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities, primarily financial assets and financial liabilities, and firm commitments. Cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions for which no underlying exposure is yet reported in the consolidated balance sheet. Net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates the majority of interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Counterparties to Linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. As of year-end, Linde AG had existing Credit Support Annexes (""CSAs"") in place with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2018, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any resulting losses would be immaterial.The following table is a summary of the notional amount and gross fair values of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for consolidated subsidiaries: 103Table of Contents Fair Value(Millions of dollars)Notional Amounts Assets (a) Liabilities (a)December 31,2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: Currency contracts: Balance sheet items $6,357 $2,693 $24 $16 $42 $16 Forecasted transactions945 — 15 — 17 — Interest rate/Cross-currency interest rate swaps2,110 — 112 — 40 —Commodity contracts — — 27 — 9 —Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments: Currency contracts: Balance sheet items $— $38 $— $— $— $2Forecasted transactions158 4 2 1 3 —Interest rate contracts: Interest rate swaps 2,164 475 13 — 10 —Total Hedges$2,322 $517 $15 $1 $13 $2Total Derivatives$11,734 $3,210 $193 $17 $121 $18 (a) Current assets of $67 million are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $126 million are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $78 million are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $43 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities. Balance Sheet ItemsForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.Linde also enters into forward currency contracts, which are designated as hedging instruments, to limit the cash flow exposure on certain foreign-currency denominated intercompany loans. The fair value adjustments on these contracts are recorded to AOCI, with the effective portion immediately reclassified to earnings to offset the fair value adjustments on the underlying debt instrument. Forecasted TransactionsForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to AOCI with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Interest Rate/Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps Cross-currency interest rate swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond. Commodity Contracts 104Table of Contents Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. As of December 31, 2018 these commodity contracts were not designated as cash flow hedges. Therefore, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are recorded to earnings and are eventually offset by the income statement impact of the underlying commodity purchase. Net investment hedgesIn 2014, Praxair designated the €600 million 1.50% Euro-denominated notes due 2020 and the €500 million ($568 million as of December 31, 2018) 1.625% Euro-denominated notes due 2025, as a hedge of the net investment position in its European operations. In 2016, Praxair designated an incremental €550 million ($628 million as of December 31, 2018) 1.20% Euro-denominated notes due 2024 as an additional hedge of the net investment position in its European operations. On October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company. In December 2018, as a condition of the merger, Praxair completed the sale of the majority of its European operations to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation. This significantly reduced the net investment position in Praxair's European operations. During the same month Praxair also repaid the €600 million 1.50% Euro-denominated notes due 2020, which significantly reduced the debt balance designated as a hedge. In response to the above transactions, Praxair de-designated €965 million of its Euro-denominated notes. At December 31, 2017 Praxair had de-designated €200 million of its Euro-denominated notes in response to the U.S. government-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and associated decrease in the tax rate.These Euro-denominated debt instruments reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments in foreign subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. Since hedge inception, exchange rate movements have reduced long-term debt by $202 million (long-term debt decreased by $105 million during the year ended December 31, 2018), with the offsetting gain shown within the cumulative translation component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Interest Rate SwapsLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability.

There was no ineffectiveness for these instruments during 2018 or 2017. The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are reclassified to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are required to be reclassified, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. The gains (losses) for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense –net on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the underlying debt. Net losses of less than $1 million are expected to be reclassified to earnings during 2019. 107Table of ContentsNOTE 15. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 and 2017: Fair Value Measurements Using(Millions of dollars)Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Assets Derivative assets$— $— $193 $17 $— $—Investments and securities *22 — — — 30 —Total$22 $— $193 $17 $30 $—Liabilities Derivative liabilities$— $— $121 $18 $— $—*Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.The following table summarizes the changes in level 3 investments and securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. Linde AG's long-term debt is primarily categorized within Level 1 measurements as the majority of the Linde AG bond portfolio is publicly traded. At December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,725 million versus a carrying value of $13,811 million. As Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair value as of the merger date, differences between the carrying value and the fair value are insignificant; remaining differences are attributable to interest rate increases subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates. At December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $8,969 million versus a carrying value of $8,762 million. 108Table of ContentsNOTE 16.

The number of new Linde ordinary shares shares issued from merger date through December 31, 2018 was approximately 255 thousand shares. Prior to the merger, Praxair issued shares related to such activity out of treasury stock.On December 10, 2018 the Linde board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of its common stock under which Linde had repurchased 4,068,642 shares through December 31, 2018. Subsequently, on January 22, 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its common stock. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. The $186 million decrease during 2018 primarily relates to the sale of Praxair's industrial gases business in Europe (see Notes 1 and 4). The ""Impact of Merger"" line item of the consolidated statements of equity includes the fair value of the noncontrolling interests acquired from Linde AG, including the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and are intended to be the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out. See Note 3.The $15 million increase during 2017 relates to additional funding provided to PG Technologies, LLC (""PGT"") by the joint venture partner. The $20 million increase during 2016 relates to the sale of an ownership interest in a majority-owned joint venture in India during the third quarter offset by the formation of PGT, a majority-owned joint venture with GE Aviation. The 2016 ""Additions (Reductions)"" line item of the consolidated statements of equity also includes an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital resulting from the sale of the noncontrolling interest to the PGT joint venture partner. Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company’s control (“redeemable noncontrolling interests”) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2018, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes one packaged gas distributor in the United States where the noncontrolling shareholder has a put option. The following is a summary of redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:(Millions of dollars)2018 2017 2016Beginning Balance$11 $11 $113Net income3 2 3Distributions to noncontrolling interest(1) (3) (2)Redemption value adjustment/accretion3 1 (6)Foreign currency translation and other— — 7Purchase/divestiture of noncontrolling interest *— — (104)Ending Balance$16 $11 $11* In June 2016, Linde acquired the remaining 34% stake in a Scandinavian joint venture for $104 million.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense was $62 million in 2018 ($59 million and $39 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $30 million in 2018 ($53 million and $32 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.Summary of Plans The 2009 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan was initially adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. on April 28, 2009 and has been amended since its initial adoption (""the 2009 Plan""). Upon completion of the business combination of Praxair, Inc. with Linde AG on October 31, 2018, the 2009 Plan was assumed by the company. Prior to April 28, 2009, Praxair, Inc. granted equity awards under the 2002 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan , (“the 2002 Plan”) which was also assumed by the company upon completion of the business combination. The 2009 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2018, 8,009,603 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2009 Plan, of which 2,600,000 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.In 2005, the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. adopted the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Praxair, Inc. (""the 2005 Plan""). Upon completion of the business combination in October 2018, the 2005 Plan was also assumed by the company. Under the 2005 Plan, the aggregate number of shares available for option and other equity grants was limited to a total of 500,000 shares. The 2005 Plan expired on April 30, 2010, by its own terms, and no shares were available for grant thereafter.Upon the completion of the business combination, all options outstanding under the 2009 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2005 Plan were converted into options to acquire the same number of shares of the company and at the same exercise price per share that applied prior to the business combination.Exercise prices for options granted under the 2009 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2009 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. Options granted under predecessor plans had similar terms.In connection with the business combination, on October 31, 2018 the company's Board of Directors adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan of Linde plc (“the LTIP 2018”), the purpose of which is to replace certain outstanding Linde AG equity based awards that were terminated. Under the LTIP 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128. As of December 31, 2018, all shares remained available for grant, as the Company is not obligated to make these replacement awards until 2019.Exercise prices for the replacement option rights to be granted in 2019 under the LTIP 2018 will be equal to EUR 1.67 as prescribed in the business combination agreement. Each replacement option right granted under the LTIP 2018 will be subject to vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant Linde AG award that had been granted before the business combination. After vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year. In order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the Company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares. Stock Option Fair ValueThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.111Table of ContentsThe weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2018 was $19.29 ($12.40 in 2017 and $8.91 in 2016) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to an increase in the company's stock price.The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2018, 2017 and 2016: Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Dividend yield2.1% 2.7% 2.9%Volatility14.4% 14.0% 14.4%Risk-free interest rate2.67% 2.13% 1.41%Expected term years5 6 6The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2018 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): ActivityNumber ofOptions(000’s) AverageExercisePrice AverageRemainingLife AggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding at January 1, 201810,787 $108.70 Granted1,625 154.00 Exercised(1,714) 95.25 Cancelled or expired(74) 131.91 Outstanding at December 31, 201810,624 $117.65 5.9 $408Exercisable at December 31, 20187,065 $111.16 4.7 $317The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $156.04 as of December 31, 2018 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2018 was $113 million ($137 million and $82 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively).Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2018 was $66 million ($107 million and $128 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $30 million for 2018 ($51 million and $32 million cash tax benefit in 2017 and 2016, respectively). As of December 31, 2018, $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.Performance-Based and Restricted Stock AwardsNo performance-based stock awards were granted in 2018 as restricted stock units were granted in place of performance-based stock awards. In years prior to 2018, the company granted performance-based stock awards under the 2009 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards were tied to either return on capital (""ROC"") performance or relative total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance versus that of the S&P 500. The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards were adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards were measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards granting during 2017 and 2016 was $109.68 and $93.46, respectively. These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period.The weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted during 2017 was $124.12 ($124.18 in 2016), and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. 112Table of ContentsUpon completion of the merger, each outstanding ROC and TSR performance-based award was converted into a Linde RSU based on performance achieved as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and became subject to service-vesting conditions only. This resulted in the conversion of 435,000 performance-based shares into 704,000 restricted stock units. Compensation expense related to these awards will continue to be recognized over the remainder of the respective three-year service period. There were 278,907 restricted stock units granted to employees by Praxair during 2018. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2018 was $144.86 ($111.95 in 2017 and $98.18 in 2016). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period. These awards were converted into equivalent Linde restricted stock units at the time of the business combination.The following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of December 31, 2018 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): Performance-Based Restricted Stock Number ofShares(000’s) AverageGrant DateFair Value Number ofShares(000’s) AverageGrant DateFair ValueNon-vested at January 1, 2018665 $113.40 264 $107.56Granted— — 279 144.86Vested(79) 119.98 (153) 117.67Award conversions(435) — 704 —Cancelled and Forfeited(151) 110.29 (23) 111.41Non-vested at December 31, 2018— $— 1,071 $118.84 There are approximately 12 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at December 31, 2018 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current ordinary shares price. As of December 31, 2018, $30 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2021.NOTE 18. RETIREMENT PROGRAMSDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.Linde has two main U.S. retirement programs which are non-contributory defined benefit plans: the Linde Pension Plan and the CBI Pension Plan. The latter program benefits primarily former employees of CBI Industries, Inc. which Linde acquired in 1996. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time choice to remain covered by the old formula or to elect coverage under a new formula. The old formula is based predominantly on years of service, age and compensation levels prior to retirement, while the new formula provides for an annual contribution to an individual account which grows with interest each year at a predetermined rate. Also, this new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. and international pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including domestic and international corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde’s international subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.Defined Benefit Pension Plans - InternationalLinde has international, defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, 113Table of Contentsinvalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. Multi-employer Pension PlansIn the United States Linde participates in six multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (""MEPs""), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, covering approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2021. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. Linde’s contributions to these plans were $2 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2017 and 2016. Total 2018 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.Linde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (""PPA"") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. The PPA classifies MEPs as either Red, Yellow or Green zone plans. Among other factors, plans in the Red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded with a projected insolvency date within the next twenty years; plans in the Yellow zone are generally 65 to 80 percent funded; and plans in the Green zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. According to the most current data available, three of the MEPs that the company participates in are in a Red zone status and three are in a Green zone status. As of December 31, 2018, the three Red Zone plans have pending or have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.Defined Contribution PlansLinde’s U.S. business employees are eligible to participate in the Linde defined contribution savings plan. Employees may contribute up to 40% of their compensation, subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations. For the U.S. packaged gases business, company contributions to this plan are calculated as a percentage of salary based on age plus service. U.S. employees other than those in the packaged gases business have company contributions to this plan calculated on a graduated scale based on employee contributions to the plan. The cost for these defined contribution plans was $33 million in 2018, $29 million in 2017 and $28 million in 2016 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (""ESOP"") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 2,381,714 at December 31, 2018.Certain international subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $32 million in 2018, $21 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow). Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. Linde is also obligated to make payments for a portion of postretirement benefits related to retirees of Linde’s former parent. Additionally, as part of the CBI acquisition in 1996, Linde assumed responsibility for healthcare and life insurance benefit obligations for CBI’s retired employees. All postretirement healthcare programs have cost caps that limit the company’s exposure to future cost increases. In addition, as part of the retirement elections made for July 1, 2002, eligible employees were given the choice of maintaining coverage in the current retiree medical design (as may be amended from time to time), or to move to a design whereby coverage would be provided, but with no Linde subsidy whatsoever. Also, all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into a business adopting these plans will not receive a company subsidy. Linde does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Pension and Postretirement Benefit CostsThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (""OPEB"") costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the table below (2018 reflects the impact of the Linde AG merger on October 31, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 3) and the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business on December 3, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 4)): 114Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions OPEB2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Amount recognized in Operating Profit Service cost$74 $46 $45 $2 $3 $2Amount recognized in Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost Interest cost128 103 100 5 5 6 Expected return on plan assets(219) (161) (157) — — — Net amortization and deferral71 68 59 (3) (3) (3) Curtailment gain (a)— — — — (18) — Settlement charges (b)14 2 4 — — — $(6) $12 $6 $2 $(16) $3Amount recognized in Net gain on sale of businesses Settlement gains from divestitures (c)(44) — — — — —Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)$24 $58 $51 $4 $(13) $5(a) The curtailment gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the termination of an OPEB plan in South America in the first quarter. (b) 2018 includes the impacts of a $4 million charge and a $10 million charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. In the third quarter, a series of lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan triggered a settlement of the related pension obligation. In the fourth quarter, a change in control provision triggered the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. 2017 includes the impact of a $2 million charge related to a series of lump sum benefit payments for employees under an international pension plan. 2016 includes a charge of $4 million related primarily to the retirement of senior managers in the United States (see Note 2). (c) In connection with Praxair merger-related divestitures, primarily the European industrial gases business, certain European pension plan obligations were settled. This resulted in the recognition of associated pension benefit obligations and deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within operating profit in the ""Net gain on sale of businesses"" line item.

Pension net actuarial losses in 2017 are driven by lower U.S. discount rates, which more than offset favorable plan asset experience. OPEB net actuarial gains in 2018 relate to the benefits from higher U.S. discount rates and favorable actual participant experience and net actuarial gains in 2017 relate primarily to favorable liability experience.The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2019 are as follows:(Millions of dollars)Pension OPEBNet actuarial loss (gain)$54 $(3)Prior service cost (credit)2 (1) $56 $(4)The following table provides information for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions2018 2017U.S. International U.S. InternationalProjected benefit obligation (""PBO"")$2,139 $6,681 $2,215 $391Accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"")$2,060 $6,586 $2,113 $383Fair value of plan assets$1,482 $5,307 $1,655 $215117Table of ContentsAssumptionsThe assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as of the respective balance sheet dates and the assumptions used to determine net benefit cost are as of the previous year-end, as shown below: Pensions U.S. International OPEB 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, Discount rate4.20% 3.61% 2.72% 4.46% 4.16% 3.58%Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.25% 3.25% 2.38% 3.35% N/A N/AWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31, Discount rate 3.73% 4.05% 2.73% 5.09% 3.81% 4.21%Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.25% 3.25% 2.45% 3.73% N/A N/AExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets (1)7.62% 8.00% 5.13% 7.91% N/A N/A________________________(1)The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.62% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 9.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.5% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 7% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 10% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 7.5% expected return), and 30%-40% alternative investments (approximately 7.5% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 8.44%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 6.26%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2019, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.50% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.

When Linde became an independent, publicly traded company in 1992, its former parent retained all liabilities for its term-vested and retired employees. Linde’s plan received assets and retained pension liabilities for its own active employee base. Therefore, the liabilities under the Linde U.S. pension plan mature at a later date compared to pension funds of other similar companies. Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans.The international pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Linde’s U.S. and international pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the target asset allocation range for 2018, by major asset category, are as follows: U.S. InternationalAsset CategoryTarget 2018 ** Target 2017 2018 2017 Target 2018 ** Target 2017 2018 2017Equity securities40%-60% 50%-70% 48% 61% 15%-25% 30%-50% 20% 38%Fixed income securities30%-50% 20%-40% 40% 30% 30%-50% 40%-60% 46% 53%Other5%-15% 2%-10% 13% 9% 30%-40% 0%-10% 34% 9%** Target asset allocations provided above for fiscal year 2018 are calculated based on weighting the individual Praxair and Linde AG pension plan target allocations by their respective portions of the total asset portfolio. 119Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Equity Securities – This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual Funds – These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. U.S. and International Government Bonds – This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and international government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Corporate Bonds – This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and international corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Pooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities. Bank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Liquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using observable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Insurance Contracts – The fair value of insurance contracts is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Real Estate Funds – This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Private Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. ContributionsAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $87 million in 2018, $19 million in 2017 and $11 121Table of Contentsmillion in 2016. Estimated required contributions for 2019 are currently expected to be in the range of $95 million to $160 million.

This resulted in a $51 million charge.122Table of ContentsNOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company’s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).Contingent LiabilitiesLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.Significant matters are:•During May 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During the 2009 third quarter, Praxair decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Praxair has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.•At December 31, 2018 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $205 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. •On September 1, 2010, CADE (""Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense"") announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines on all five companies. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$2.2 billion Brazilian reais (US$568 million) against White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Praxair. In response to a motion for clarification, the fine was reduced to R$1.7 billion Brazilian reais (US$439 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The amount of the fine is subject to indexation using SELIC. On September 2, 2010, Praxair issued a press release and filed a report on Form 8-K rejecting all claims and stating that the fine represents a gross and arbitrary disregard of Brazilian law.On October 19, 2010, White Martins filed an annulment petition (“appeal”) with the Federal Court in Brasilia seeking to have the fine against White Martins entirely overturned. In order to suspend payment of the fine pending the completion of the appeal process, Brazilian law required that the company tender a form of guarantee in the amount of the fine as security. Initially, 50% of the guarantee was satisfied by letters of credit with a financial institution and 50% by equity of a Brazilian subsidiary. On April 15, 2016, the Ninth Federal Court in Brasilia allowed White Martins to withdraw and cancel the letters of credit. Accordingly, the guarantee is currently satisfied solely by equity of a Brazilian subsidiary. On September 14, 2015, the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia overturned the fine against White Martins and declared the original CADE administrative proceeding to be null and void. On June 30, 2016, CADE filed an appeal against this decision with the Federal Circuit Court in Brasilia.123Table of ContentsPraxair strongly believes that the allegations are without merit and that the fine will be entirely overturned during the appeal process. The company further believes that it has strong defenses and will vigorously defend against the allegations and related fine up to such levels of the Federal Courts in Brazil as may be necessary. Because appeals in Brazil historically take many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate when the appeal will be finally decided. Based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel, no reserve has been recorded for this proceeding as management does not believe that a loss is probable.•As stated above, in 2010, the Brazilian competition authority CADE imposed fines on a number of gases companies, including Linde AG’s Brazilian subsidiary, on the grounds of alleged anti-competitive business conduct. CADE imposed a fine of approximately R$188 million Brazilian reais (US $49 million) on Linde AG’s Brazilian subsidiary. Based on the fact that the fine has been overturned by a federal court in the first instance and on a subsequent appeal by CADE, Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review in the third instance either, and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserve has been recorded for this proceeding as management does not believe that a loss is probable.CommitmentsAt December 31, 2018, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $2,961 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including foreign litigation matters.Other commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 6, 7, 13, and 18).124Table of Contents NOTE 20. SEGMENT INFORMATIONEffective October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG completed the previously announced merger of equals transaction pursuant to the business combination agreement, resulting in a newly formed corporation named Linde plc. See Notes 1,3 and 4 for additional information on the merger. Although it is the company’s intention to create new operating segments that will be used by management to allocate company resources and assess performance, due to the hold separate order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (see Note 1) it was not possible to implement this new management organization structure in calendar 2018. Therefore, the company has added Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date, which is consistent with the way the company was managed and results reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. As the restrictions under the hold separate order was lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company implemented a new operating segment structure effective for 2019 reporting periods, as follows: Americas; EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa); APAC (Asia/Pacific), Engineering and Other. Accordingly, during 2018 the company’s operations were organized into five reportable segments, four of which have been determined on a geographic basis of segmentation: North America, Europe, South America and Asia. The company’s worldwide surface technologies business represents the fifth reportable segment. As discussed above, Linde AG became a sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on October 31, 2018.Linde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and surface technologies. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance. Linde evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based primarily on operating profit, excluding purchase accounting impacts of Linde AG, inter-company royalties and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. Corporate and globally managed expenses, and research and development costs relating to Praxair’s global industrial gases business, are allocated to operating segments based on sales. The table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

REVENUE RECOGNITIONEffective January 1, 2018, Linde adopted the FASB's Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (""ASC 606"") relating to Revenue Recognition using the modified retrospective transition method. The new accounting standard requires revenue to be recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. No material differences in revenue recognition were identified as compared to the company's historical revenue recognition accounting; accordingly, there is no adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and therefore no need to present comparable revenue in accordance with the prior accounting policy. The following sections include Linde's revenue recognition accounting policies and disclosures in accordance with ASC 606. Contracts with CustomersApproximately 76% of Linde’s consolidated sales are generated from industrial gases and related products in four geographic segments (North America, Europe, South America and Asia), Linde AG represents approximately 19% of 2018 sales and the remaining 5% is related to the global surface technologies segment. Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. Industrial GasesWithin each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde’s primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.Following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies: On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three-to seven-year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where 128Table of Contentscylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. Surface TechnologiesThe company’s surface technologies segment, operated through Praxair Surface Technologies, Inc., supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. Praxair Surface Technologies is a leading global supplier of coatings services and thermal spray consumables to customers in the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile, and other industries. Its coatings are used to provide wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal insulation, and many other surface-enhancing functions which serve to extend component life, enable optimal performance, and reduce operating costs. It also manufactures a complete line of electric arc, plasma and wire spray, and high-velocity oxy-fuel (""HVOF"") equipment.The company’s performance obligation related to surface technologies customers are generally satisfied at a point in time when the customer receives and takes control of product. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up the product from the company’s facility, and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.Linde EngineeringThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $283 million and contract liabilities of $1,546 million at December 31, 2018. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business acquired in the merger. The Industrial Gases Businesses and Surface Technologies do not have material contract assets or liabilities.Payment Terms and OtherLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the Industrial Gases Businesses and Surface Technologies. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.129Table of ContentsDisaggregated Revenue InformationThe company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the surface technologies business is managed on a global basis. Linde AG had been managed as a separate segment due to the restrictions under the hold separate order, which were lifted on March 1, 2019. Further, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing. The following table shows sales by distribution method for each reportable segment and at the consolidated level for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The company estimates the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $45 billion. This amount excludes all sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements are estimated to be earned in the next five years and the remaining thereafter.130Table of ContentsNOTE 22.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTSDivestituresOn March 1, 2019, Linde AG completed the sale of the majority of its industrial gases business in North America and certain industrial gases business activities in South America to a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018 and February 20, 2019, by and among the Company, Linde AG, Praxair, Inc., Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII (the “SPA”). Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII paid $2.97 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold businesses. The SPA was entered into as part of the commitments in connection with the merger control review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) of the previously completed combination of the businesses of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG under the Company (the ”business combination” - see Note 1). As part of the company’s, Praxair’s and Linde AG’s further commitments in connection with the merger control review by the FTC, Linde AG divested additional assets within the Americas for aggregate net proceeds of $531 million (i) to Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc., five of Linde AG’s HyCO facilities outside the Gulf Coast region, along with Linde AG’s hydrogen pipeline in the Gulf Coast, intellectual property, customer contracts, and other assets, (ii) to Celanese Corporation, Linde AG's Clear Lake, Texas plant, and (iii) to LyondellBasell Industries N.V., Linde AG’s La Porte, Texas plant. Hold Separate OrderAdditionally, concurrent with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the United States, on March 1, 2019, the hold separate order restrictions described in Note 1 were lifted and the Company was able to commence integration activities. 133Table of ContentsITEM 9.

The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. Linde’s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2020 83% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 17% are related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.Linde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North and South America (""Americas"")Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)Asia and Pacific (“APAC”)United StatesGermanyChina & TaiwanBrazilUnited KingdomAustraliaMexicoEastern EuropeSouth KoreaCanadaIndiaThe company manufactures and distributes its industrial gas products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company’s customer base. The majority of Linde’s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, healthcare, food and beverage, and aerospace. 19Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK2020 Year in review•Sales of $27,243 million were 3% below 2019 sales of $28,228 million. Volumes decreased 2% as growth from project start-ups was more than offset by the global macroeconomic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales. Unfavorable currency translation, lower cost pass-through and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased sales by 3%. •Reported operating profit of $3,322 million was 13% above 2019. Adjusted operating profit of $5,797 million was 10% above 2019. The increase in both reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and other charges and productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of lower volumes.*•Income from continuing operations of $2,497 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.70 increased from $2,183 million and $4.00, respectively in 2019. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $4,371 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.23 were 9% and 12%, respectively above 2019 adjusted amounts.*•Cash flow from operations was $7,429 million, or 27% of sales. Capital expenditures were $3,400 million; dividends paid were $2,028 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,410 million; and debt borrowings, net were $1,313 million.*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section in this MD&A.2021 OutlookLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

Results of OperationsThe following table provides a summary of changes in consolidated sales:21Table of Contents2020 vs. 2019 % ChangeFactors Contributing to Changes - SalesVolume(2)%Price/Mix2 %Cost pass-through(1)%Currency(1)%Acquisitions/divestitures(1)%Engineering— %(3)%2020 Compared With 2019 SalesReported sales decreased $985 million, or 3%, for the 2020 year versus 2019. On an adjusted basis sales decreased $920 million in 2020 compared to 2019.On a reported and adjusted basis, sales decreased 3%. Volume decreased sales by 2% primarily driven by the impact of the macroeconomic slowdown, partially offset by new project start-ups. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, largely in the Americas, driven by the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Cost pass-through decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. The impact of merger-related divestitures decreased sales by $65 million in 2020. These sales have been excluded from the adjusted numbers.Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $1,261 million, or 8%, for the year primarily due to lower volumes and the impact of productivity initiatives. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 56.5% and 59.0% of sales, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the impact of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives and the impact of lower cost pass-through.Selling, general and administrative expensesSelling, general and administrative expense (""SG&A"") decreased $264 million, or 8%, in 2020 to $3,193 million. SG&A was 11.7% of sales in 2020 versus 12.2% in 2019. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $34 million in 2020. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&A decreased driven by the impact of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives. Depreciation and amortizationReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $49 million, or 1%, versus 2019. The decrease is primarily due to currency translation impacts.On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $29 million, or 1%, versus 2019. The decrease is primarily due to currency translation impacts which decreased depreciation and amortization by approximately $39 million in 2020 slightly offset by new project start ups primarily in APAC and the Americas. Cost reduction programs and other chargesLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $506 million and $567 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily associated with the company's cost reduction program, which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger. 2019 also included an asset impairment of approximately $73 million related to a joint venture in APAC resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted basis, these costs have been eliminated in both periods. Operating profitReported operating profit increased $389 million in 2020, or 13%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $525 million, or 10%, for 2020 versus 2019.On a reported basis, operating profit increased $389 million, or 13% in 2020. The increase in the year was driven by higher price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives. Cost reduction programs and other charges 22Table of Contentswere $506 million in 2020 and $567 million in 2019. 2019 also included a $164 million one time net gain on sale of business.On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges and net gains from merger-related divestitures in 2019, operating profit increased $525 million, or 10%. Operating profit growth was driven by higher price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by lower volumes, unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.Interest expense - netReported interest expense – net in 2020 increased $77 million, or 203%, versus 2019 and included a $16 million charge for the early redemption of bonds due in 2021 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). On an adjusted basis interest expense increased $50 million, or 37% in 2020 as compared to 2019.On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase year over year included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on unhedged intercompany loans and lower interest income, partially offset by a lower effective borrowing rate. Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service costReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $177 million in 2020 versus a benefit of $32 million in 2019. 2020 included pension settlement charges of $6 million while 2019 included pension settlement charges of $97 million and a net $8 million curtailment charge (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these charges, the net pension and OPEB benefit, excluding service cost increased $46 million in 2020, as the benefit of lower interest cost due to the low discount rate environment more than offset higher amortization of deferred losses. Effective tax rateThe reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2020 was 25.0% versus 26.3% in 2019. The decrease in the reported ETR is primarily due to higher tax benefits from share option exercises and higher tax expense in 2019 related to divestitures.On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2020 was 23.8% versus 24.0% in 2019. The decrease in the adjusted ETR is primarily due to higher tax benefits from share option exercises.Income from equity investmentsReported income from equity investments for 2020 was $85 million as compared to $114 million in 2019. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2020 was $142 million versus $171 million in 2019. The decrease in the reported and adjusted income from equity investments was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency revaluation impacts on an unhedged loan of an investment in EMEA. Noncontrolling interests from continuing operationsAt December 31, 2020, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $36 million to $125 million in 2020 from $89 million in 2019, primarily driven by the noncontrolling interest impact of $33 million for an asset impairment charge in the third quarter 2019 related to a joint venture in APAC.Adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $8 million in 2020 as compared to 2019.Income from continuing operationsReported income from continuing operations increased $314 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher overall operating profit and a lower effective tax rate. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other non-GAAP adjustments, income from continuing operations increased $368 million, or 9%, in 2020 versus 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit partially offset by higher interest expense and lower equity income.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.70, or 18%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. 23Table of ContentsOn an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $8.23 in 2020 increased 12% versus 2019, primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding.EmployeesThe number of employees at December 31, 2020 was 74,207, a decrease of 5,679 employees from December 31, 2019 primarily driven by cost reduction actions and divestitures. Other Financial DataEBITDA increased to $8,033 million in 2020 from $7,722 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $8,645 million for 2020 as compared to $8,178 million in 2019 primarily due to higher income from continuing operations versus the prior year period. See the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $157 million resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $595 million largely offset by a decrease in the funded status of the company's retirement obligations of $469 million driven by the low discount rate environment. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. See the ""Currency"" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment.Related Party TransactionsThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.Environmental MattersLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. Climate ChangeLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions, and Linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, several other countries worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the company's customers and Linde operations, among those regulations in China, Singapore and the European Union. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.Linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on air quality. Hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.24Table of ContentsTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. Linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG footprint through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, investment in renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. At the same time, Linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions, including GHG emissions, in Linde's processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.Costs Relating to the Protection of the EnvironmentEnvironmental protection costs in 2020 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2020, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.Retirement BenefitsPensionsThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and international pension plans was a benefit of $28 million in 2020 and costs of $107 million and $24 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of $97 million related to lump sum payments, which were triggered by either a change in control provision or merger-related divestitures, and a net curtailment charge of $8 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges were $6 million and $14 million for 2020 and 2018, respectively.The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $436 million and $504 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The funded status for international plans was a deficit of $2,334 million and $1,801 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impact of unfavorable liability experience, primarily resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset returns. Global pension contributions were $91 million in 2020, $94 million in 2019, and $87 million in 2018. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2021 are currently expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.25Table of ContentsLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2021 of 7.00% and 5.27% for the U.S. and international plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios. Excluding the impact of any settlements, 2021 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $36 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.InsuranceLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers’ compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States, $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. In addition, the company self retains risk up to €5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils effecting its properties along with a separate €5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had recorded a total of $71 million and $66 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company’s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.Linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.26Table of ContentsSEGMENT DISCUSSIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources.

For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde’s results of operations in any given period.To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of 2020Statements of IncomeBalance Sheets ConsolidatedAverage Year Ended December 31,December 31,CurrencySales2020201920202019Euro22 %0.88 0.89 0.82 0.89 Chinese yuan8 %6.90 6.90 6.53 6.96 British pound6 %0.78 0.78 0.73 0.75 Australian dollar4 %1.45 1.44 1.30 1.42 Brazilian real3 %5.11 3.94 5.20 4.03 Canadian dollar3 %1.34 1.33 1.27 1.30 Taiwan dollar3 %29.46 30.90 28.09 29.99 Mexican peso2 %21.35 19.24 19.91 18.93 Korean won2 %1,178 1,165 1,087 1,156 Indian rupee2 %74.08 70.40 73.07 71.38 Republic of South African rand1 %16.37 14.43 14.69 14.00 Swedish kroner1 %9.18 9.45 8.23 9.37 Thailand bhat1 %31.28 31.04 29.96 29.71 32Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31,20202019Net Cash Provided by (Used for)Operating ActivitiesIncome from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests)$2,622 $2,272 Non-cash charges (credits): Add: Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments (a)258 (236) Add: Amortization of merger-related inventory step-up— 12 Less: Net gain on sale of businesses, net of tax— (108) Add: Depreciation and amortization4,626 4,675 Add (Less): Deferred income taxes(369)(303) Add (Less): non-cash charges and other 285 (32) Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash charges and other7,422 6,280 Less: Pension contributions(91)(94)Add (Less): Working capital364 (160)Add (Less): Other(266)93 Net cash provided by operating activities$7,429 $6,119 Investing ActivitiesCapital expenditures$(3,400)$(3,682)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired(68)(225)Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested482 5,096 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(2,986)$1,189 Financing ActivitiesDebt increases (decreases) – net$1,313 $(1,260)Issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares – net(2,410)(2,586)Cash dividends – Linde plc shareholders(2,028)(1,891)Noncontrolling interest transactions and other(220)(3,260)Net cash (used) for financing activities$(3,345)$(8,997)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash$(44)$(77)Cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period$3,754 $2,700 ____________________(a)See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Cash increased $1,054 million in 2020 versus 2019. The primary sources of cash in 2020 were cash flows from operations of $7,429 million, net debt issuances of $1,313 million and proceeds from divestitures and asset sales of $482 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $3,400 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,410 million, and cash dividends to shareholders of $2,028 million. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other of $3,260 million in 2019 included a payment of approximately $3.2 billion related to the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).33Table of ContentsCash Flows From Operations 2020 compared with 2019Cash flows from operations was $7,429 million, or 27% of sales, an increase of $1,310 million from $6,119 million, or 22% of sales in 2019. The increase was driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges, better working capital management, and lower merger and synergy related cash outflows. Cost reduction programs and other charges of $506 million and $567 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were offset by related cash outflows of $248 million and $803 million, respectively. 34Table of ContentsInvesting2020 compared with 2019Net cash used for investing activities was $2,986 million in 2020 versus net cash provided by investing activities of $1,189 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower proceeds from merger-related divestitures, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and acquisitions.Capital expenditures in 2020 were $3,400 million, a decrease of $282 million from 2019. Capital expenditures during 2020 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 41% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 35% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment. At December 31, 2020, Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $3.6 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.Acquisition expenditures in 2020 were $68 million, a decrease of $157 million from 2019 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC. Divestitures and asset sales in 2020 totaled $482 million as compared to $5,096 million in 2019. The 2020 period includes net proceeds from merger-related divestitures of $98 million from the sale of selected assets of Linde China and proceeds of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia. The 2019 period includes net proceeds from merger-related divestitures of $3.4 billion from the sale of Linde AG's Americas business, $1.2 billion from the sale of Linde South Korea and approximately $200 million each from the sale of the legacy Praxair and legacy Linde India selected assets (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).FinancingLinde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).Cash used for financing activities was $3,345 million in 2020 compared to $8,997 million in 2019. Cash provided by debt was $1,313 million in 2020 versus cash used for debt of $1,260 million in 2019 primarily due to bond issuances in 2020 and increased commercial paper borrowings, net of bond repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $2,410 million in 2020 versus $2,586 million in 2019. Cash dividends increased to $2,028 million in 2020 versus $1,891 million in 2019 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.50 per share to $3.85 per share. The 2019 period also includes an 35Table of Contentsoutflow of approximately $3.2 billion relating to the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2020, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt activity in 2020, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2020 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.The company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2020. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.Linde’s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $12,400 million, $1,144 million higher than $11,256 million at December 31, 2019. The December 31, 2020 net debt balance includes $15,048 million in public securities, $1,106 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $3,754 million of cash. Linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2% for 2020. In May 2020, Linde issued €750 million of 0.250% notes due 2027 and €750 million 0.550% notes due 2032. In August, 2020, Linde issued $700 million of 1.100% notes due 2030 and $300 million of 2.000% notes due 2050. In September 2020, the company repaid €1,000 million in 1.75% notes and $300 million of 2.25% notes that became due. In December 2020, the company repaid $500 million of 4.05% notes and $500 million of 3.00% notes that were due in 2021 resulting in a $16 million interest charge (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). On January 25, 2021, the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $5.0 billion of its ordinary shares. For additional information related to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.36Table of ContentsOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2020, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde’s Audit Committee.Revenue RecognitionLong-Term Construction Contracts The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Pension BenefitsPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including long-term inflation rates, employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year.The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.00% for U.S. plans and 5.31% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 (7.27% and 5.15%, respectively at December 31, 2019). The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $42 million.The company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses 37Table of Contentsare recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $9,408 million, or $555 million lower than the fair value of assets of $9,963 million at December 31, 2020. These net deferred investment losses of $555 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.Discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. The company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant U.S. and international plans using the spot rate approach. U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2020 benefit costs. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would increase Linde’s pension expense by approximately $42 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of $12 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $1,054 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $932 million. The weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.55% for international plans at December 31, 2020 (3.25% and 2.46%, respectively, at December 31, 2019). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $8 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $70 million.Asset ImpairmentsGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles AssetsAt December 31, 2020, the company had goodwill of $28,201 million and $1,992 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated no impairment. At December 31, 2020, Linde’s enterprise value was approximately $150 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus net debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $62 billion.The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. Management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2020 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the 2018 Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.Other indefinite-lived intangible assets from Linde AG recently fair valued are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.See Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.38Table of ContentsLong-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may a collection of distribution related assets (cylinders, distribution centers, and stores) or be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. Income TaxesAt December 31, 2020, Linde had deferred tax assets of $2,270 million (net of valuation allowances of $243 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $8,706 million. At December 31, 2020, uncertain tax positions totaled $452 million (see Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $847 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or about 25.0% of pre-tax income (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions. The company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.ContingenciesThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.Linde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements.39Table of ContentsFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company’s financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.The non-GAAP measures in the following reconciliations are presented in this MD&A.Adjusted Amounts(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)Year Ended December 31,20202019Adjusted SalesReported Sales$27,243 $28,228 Less: Merger-related divestitures (d)— (65)Adjusted Sales$27,243 $28,163 Adjusted Operating Profit and Operating MarginReported operating profit$3,322 $2,933 Less: Merger-related divestitures (d)— (16)Add: Cost reduction programs and other charges506 567 Less: Net gain on sale of businesses— (164)Add: Purchase accounting impacts -

Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchasing accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements.A summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows:Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the periods presented relate primarily to depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger and the allocation of fair value step-up for ongoing Linde AG asset disposals (reflected in Other Income/(Expense)). Adjusted Interest Expense - Net: Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.Adjusted Income from Equity Investments: Represents the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets. Adjusted Noncontrolling Interests from Continuing Operations: Represents the noncontrolling interests’ ownership portion of the adjustments described above determined on an entity by entity basis.(d) To adjust for the results of Praxair's merger-related divestitures.Net Debt and Adjusted Net DebtNet debt is a financial liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to evaluate the ability of a company to repay its debt.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Note 1 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2020. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2020, Linde had debt totaling $16,154 million ($13,956 million at December 31, 2019). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2020, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,365 million and floating-rate debt of $5,789 million, representing 64% and 36%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2019, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,799 million and floating-rate debt of $3,157 million, representing 77% and 23%, respectively, of total debt. Fixed Rate DebtIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate, interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2020, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $674 million ($473 million in 2019). A one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $61 million increase to derivative assets recorded.Variable Rate DebtAt December 31, 2020, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $44 million ($48 million in 2019).Foreign Currency RiskLinde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in Latin America (primarily Brazil and Mexico), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the U.K.), Canada, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and China) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2020, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $7,553 million ($9,713 million at December 31, 2019) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Holding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% increase in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 would decrease by approximately $99 million and at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $194 million, which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.46Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Subsequent Events10547Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLinde’s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.Linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGLinde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 as stated in their report. /s/ STEPHEN F.

WhiteChief Financial Officer March 1, 202148Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plcOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.49Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at CompletionAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,851 million of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was generated from the sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimated costs at completion and management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions involved evaluating management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates and significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPStamford, ConnecticutMarch 1, 2021We have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1992. 50Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESLinde plc (""Linde"" or ""the company"") is an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland. Linde’s registered office is located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland. Linde’s principal executive offices are located at The Priestley Centre, 10 Priestley Road, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XY, United Kingdom. Linde trades on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol LIN.Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("" U.S. GAAP"") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Equity income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.Operations – Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde’s Engineering business offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including supplying plant components and services directly to customers.Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 19 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies. Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment – Net – Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes labor, applicable overhead and interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are also capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 8). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.The company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.Asset-Retirement Obligations – An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company’s asset-retirement obligations are 58Table of Contentsprimarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation – For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 7). Financial Instruments – Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Provided the hedge remains highly effective, any ineffectiveness is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to anticipated net income and currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.See Note 12 for additional information relating to financial instruments.Goodwill – Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. The qualitative analysis of goodwill for the year ending December 31, 2020 showed the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value, as such further analysis was not performed. See Note 9 for additional information relating to goodwill.59Table of ContentsOther Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process.See Note 10 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – Assets held for sale, as well as liabilities directly related to these assets, are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets as held for sale if the requirements of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are satisfied. The main requirements of ASC 360 are: (i) management having the authority to approve the action has committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (ii) the assets are available for sale in their present condition at a reasonable market price, and (iii) a sale within the next twelve months is probable. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Amortization and depreciation has been discontinued. The process involved in determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.Discontinued operations are reported as soon as a business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and when the business to be disposed of represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the company’s operations and financial results. Businesses acquired with the intent of divesting are also required to be reported as discontinued operations. The profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations. The information provided in the Notes relates to continuing operations. If the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted accordingly.Income Taxes – Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.Under the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. See Note 5 for additional information relating to income taxes.Retirement Benefits – Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees’ expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices. See Note 16 for additional information relating to retirement programs.Share-based Compensation– The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. 60Table of ContentsSee Note 15 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.Reclassifications – Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Implemented in 2020 •Credit Losses on Financial Instruments –In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of credit losses. The guidance introduces a new accounting model for expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on estimates of current expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 and requires companies to apply the change in accounting on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of the guidance had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.•Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment – In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020. The adoption of the guidance had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.•Fair Value Measurement Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments must be applied prospectively while other amendments must be applied retrospectively. The adoption of the guidance had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.•Retirement Benefit Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of the guidance had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements impacting disclosure only.Accounting Standards to be Implemented•Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes - In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing several exceptions in the current standard and adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, such as requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date, evaluating whether a step-up in tax basis of goodwill relates to a business combination or a separate transaction and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.•Reference Rate Reform - In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance related to reference rate reform which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions that the reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates. This update is applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. The amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.NOTE 2. Business Combination and DivestituresMerger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG61Table of ContentsOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company.In connection with the business combination, each share of common stock of Praxair par value $0.01 per share, (excluding any shares held in treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which were automatically canceled and retired for no consideration) was converted into one ordinary share, par value €0.001 per share, of Linde plc. Additionally, each tendered share of common stock of Linde AG was converted into 1.54 ordinary shares of Linde plc.As provided in the business combination agreement, at the effective time of the business combination outstanding Praxair stock options and other equity awards were generally converted into stock options and equity awards on a 1:1 basis with respect to Linde shares. Outstanding Linde AG share-based compensation awards were either settled in cash (for the portion vested), or were converted into similar stock options and equity awards with respect to Linde shares (for the portion unvested), after giving effect to the 1.54 exchange ratio.Results of Linde AG Operations in 2018The results of operations of Linde AG have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of income since the merger. The following table provides Linde AG “Sales” and “Income (loss) from continuing operations” included in the company's results for the period November 1 through December 31, 2018.Millions of dollarsLinde AG Results of OperationsNovember 1, - December 31, 2018Sales$2,873 Income (loss) from continuing operations*$(385)*Includes net charges of $451 million related to the impacts of purchase accounting.Unaudited Pro Forma Information - 2018Linde's unaudited pro forma results presented below were prepared pursuant to the requirements of ASC 805 and give effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only, and do not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2017. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future operating results and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved.The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments for the preliminary purchase accounting impact (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired tangible and intangible assets, amortization of the fair value adjustment to investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and reduction of interest expense related to the fair value adjustment to long-term debt along with the related tax and non-controlling interest impacts), the alignment of accounting policies, adjustments due to IFRS compliant reporting conversion to U.S. GAAP and the elimination of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG.The unaudited pro forma results exclude the results of operations of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures as these divestitures are reflected as discontinued operations. The Praxair merger-related divestitures are included in the results from continuing operations, including the results from Praxair's European business through the disposition date of December 3, 2018, in the unaudited pro forma results presented below, for all periods presented, as these divestitures do not qualify for discontinued operations.The unaudited pro forma results are summarized below:Millions of dollars2018Sales (a)$29,774 Income from continuing operations$4,739 (a) Includes sales from Praxair's merger-related divestitures of $1,625 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.Significant nonrecurring amounts reflected in the pro forma results are as follows:62Table of ContentsA $3,294 million gain ($2,923 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business and is included in the December 31, 2018 pro forma income from continuing operations.From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG collectively incurred pre-tax costs of $736 million ($680 million after tax) to prepare for and close the merger. These merger costs were reflected within the results of operations in the pro forma results as if they were incurred on January 1, 2017. Any costs incurred related to merger-related divestitures and integration and to prepare for the intended business separations were reflected in the pro forma results in the period in which they were incurred.The company incurred pre-tax charges of $368 million ( $279 million after tax) and $10 million ($8 million after tax) in 2018 related to the fair value step‑up of inventories acquired and sold as well as a pension settlement due to the payout to certain participants as a result of change in control provisions within a U.S. nonqualified pension plan, respectively. The 2018 pro forma results were adjusted to exclude these charges. Merger-Related DivestituresPraxair Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily European Industrial Gases BusinessAs a condition of the EC regulatory approval of the merger transaction, Praxair agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in Europe. The below transactions were completed in 2018, and the company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $3,294 million ($2,923 million after tax) in the consolidated statements of income.•The Società Italiana Acetilene e Derivati S.p.A. (""SIAD"") Sale and Purchase Agreement dated December 5, 2017 whereby Praxair agreed, inter alia, to sell its 34% non-controlling participation in its Italian joint venture SIAD to its joint venture partner Flow Fin in exchange for Flow Fin’s 40% non-controlling participation in Praxair’s majority-owned Italian joint venture, Rivoira S.p.A., and cash payment of a net purchase price of €90 million ($102 million as of October 31, 2018) by Praxair to Flow Fin. This transaction was completed on October 31, 2018, and;•The Praxair Europe Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 5, 2018 pursuant to which Praxair sold the majority of its European businesses to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation for €5,000 million in cash consideration ($5,700 million at December 3, 2018), reduced by estimated normal closing adjustments of €86 million ($96 million). These transactions were completed on December 3, 2018.Additionally, to satisfy regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, Praxair agreed to sell certain operations in Chile, China, India and South Korea. The Chilean business was sold as part of the Linde AG Americas SPA (as defined below). The sale of the select Indian assets was completed on July 12, 2019 with a sale price of $218 million and resulted in a gain of $164 million recognized in ""Net gain on sale of businesses"" in the consolidated statements of income. The sale of select assets in South Korea and China were completed in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These businesses were evaluated for discontinued operations accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP and it was determined that they did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation as these transactions did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect, after considering the impact of the merger. Linde AG Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily Americas Industrial Gases BusinessAs a condition of the U.S. regulatory approval of the merger, Linde AG agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in the Americas, as described below:•The Linde AG Americas Sales and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as and further amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018, and February 20, 2019 whereby Linde AG and Praxair, Inc. entered into an agreement with a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII to sell the majority of Linde AG’s industrial gases business in North America and certain industrial gases business activities of Linde AG's in South America for $2.9 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold 63Table of Contentsbusinesses.

Total charges related to the cost reduction programs were $391 million ($277 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) and $304 million ($233 million, after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Severance costsDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, severance costs of $298 million were recorded for the elimination of approximately 3,100 positions. Severance costs of $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 were recorded for the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the actions have been taken, with the remaining actions anticipated to be completed within the next 12 months. Other cost reduction chargesOther cost reduction charges were $93 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These amounts primarily represent charges related to the execution of the company's synergistic actions including location consolidations and business rationalization projects, software and process harmonization, and associated non-recurring costs.Merger-Related Costs and Other ChargesMerger-related costs and other charges were $115 million ($95 million, after tax), $263 million ($211 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests), and $309 million ($306 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 2019 includes other charges for an asset impairment related to a joint venture in APAC of approximately $73 million ($42 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling. 2018 includes other charges of $73 million comprised of the following; (i) a $40 million charge ($40 million, after-tax) related to an unfavorable development related to a supplier contract in China, (ii) restructuring charges of $21 million ($18 million, after-tax) and (iii) a $12 million charge ($12 million, after-tax) associated with the transition to hyper-inflationary accounting in Argentina.Cash RequirementsTotal cash requirements of the cost reduction program and other charges during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 are estimated to be approximately $390 million, of which $221 million was paid through December 31, 2020. 65Table of ContentsRemaining cash requirements are expected to be paid through 2023. Total cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 also reflect the impact of cash payments of liabilities, including merger-related tax liabilities, accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.The following table summarizes the activities related to the company's cost reduction programs and other charges during 2019 and 2020:(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotal2019 Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges$204 $100 304 $263 $567 Less: Cash payments(91)(57)(148)(112)(260)Less: Non-cash charges— (21)(21)(78)(99)Foreign currency translation and other4 (6)(2)(6)(8)Balance, December 31, 2019$117 $16 $133 $67 $200 2020 Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges298 93 391 115 506 Less: Cash payments(156)(20)(176)(45)(221)Less: Non-cash charges— (68)(68)(82)(150)Foreign currency translation and other24 1 25 9 34 Balance, December 31, 2020$283 $22 $305 $64 $369 Classification in the consolidated financial statements The pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded as other current or long-term liabilities (see Note 7). On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 18 Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.NOTE 4. LEASESIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Linde determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Total lease and rental expenses related to operating lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $341 million, and $364 million respectively. Operating leases costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Total lease and rental expenses related to finance lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $44 million and $31 million, respectively, and the costs are included in depreciation and amortization and interest. Related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Linde includes renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Operating and financing lease expenses above include short term and variable lease costs which are immaterial.As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, Linde uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Linde determines incremental borrowing rates through market sources. The company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases that meet the short-term lease definition are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance. The company does not have material variable lease payments.66Table of ContentsGains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial. Operating cash flows used for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $317 million and $341 million, respectively. Cash flows used for finance leases for the same period were immaterial.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the tax payable related to the deemed repatriation tax is $230 million and $261 million, respectively, of which $204 million and $235 million is classified as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet (See Note 7), respectively. The company is required to fund the balance in annual installments through 2025.Effective Tax Rate ReconciliationFor purposes of the effective tax rate reconciliation, the company utilizes the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21%. An analysis of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income follows: 68Table of Contents(Dollar amounts in millions)Year Ended December 31,202020192018U.S. statutory income tax$711 21.0 %$615 21.0 %$1,060 21.0 %State and local taxes – net of federal benefit21 0.6 %31 1.1 %30 0.6 %U.S. tax credits and deductions (a)(8)(0.2)%(31)(1.1)%(12)(0.2)%Foreign tax differentials (b)167 4.9 %113 3.9 %57 1.1 %Share-Based compensation(53)(1.6)%(41)(1.4)%(22)(0.4)%Tax Act— — %— — %(61)(1.2)%Divestitures (c)— — %36 1.2 %(321)(6.4)%Other – net (d)9 0.3 %46 1.6 %86 1.7 %Provision for income taxes$847 25.0 %$769 26.3 %$817 16.2 % ________________________(a)U.S. tax credits and deductions relate to foreign derived intangible income and the research and experimentation tax credit in 2020, 2019 and 2018.(b)Primarily related to differences between the U.S. tax rate and the statutory tax rate in the countries where the company operates.

After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2020, the company had $386 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $243 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $276 million relating to NOLs of which $34 million expire within 5 years, $110 million expire after 5 years and $132 million have no expiration. The 70Table of Contentsdeferred tax assets also include $110 million related to credits of which $9 million expire within 5 years, $93 million expire after 5 years, and $8 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $243 million primarily relate to NOLs and are required because management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the NOLs will be utilized before they expire. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.The company has $609 million of foreign income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2020. A provision has not been made for any additional foreign income tax at December 31, 2020 on approximately $32 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $32 billion could become subject to additional foreign income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary, or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.Uncertain Tax PositionsUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $452 million, $472 million and $319 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (Millions of dollars)202020192018Unrecognized income tax benefits, January 1$472 $319 $54 Additions for tax positions of prior years (a)35 151 104 Reductions for tax positions of prior years(34)(3)(7)Additions for current year tax positions (b)11 33 179 Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (c)(39)(26)(3)Foreign currency translation and other7 (2)(8)Unrecognized income tax benefits, December 31$452 $472 $319 ________________________(a)Increase primarily relates to tax positions in the United States and Europe, $66 million in 2019 related to the merger with Linde AG.(b)2018 includes $167 million related to the merger with Linde AG.(c)Settlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty. The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest expense of $29 million, $1 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The company had $99 million and $65 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 7). 71Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2020, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below: Major tax jurisdictionsOpen YearsNorth and South AmericaUnited States2017 through 2020Canada2013 through 2020Mexico2014 through 2020Brazil2003 through 2020Europe and AfricaFrance2014 through 2020Germany2015 through 2020Netherlands2015 through 2020Republic of South Africa2017 through 2020Spain2006 through 2020United Kingdom2015 through 2020Asia and AustraliaAustralia2016 through 2020China2015 through 2020India2006 through 2020South Korea2015 through 2020Taiwan2015 through 2020The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.72Table of ContentsNOTE 6.

Linde applies loss rates that are lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition of the receivables. These expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default rates for each business, taking regional circumstances into account. If necessary, these historical default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. The loss rates are also evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability of the receivables. Gross trade receivables aged less than one year were $4,169 million and $4,075 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and gross receivables aged greater than one year were $358 million and $249 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Gross other receivables were $111 million and $304 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Receivables aged greater than one year are generally fully reserved unless specific circumstances warrant exceptions, such as those backed by federal governments. Provisions for expected credit losses were $182 million, $170 million and $25 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance activity in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to write-offs of uncollectible amounts, net of recoveries and currency movements is not material.74Table of ContentsDecember 31,20202019InventoriesRaw materials and supplies$411 $396 Work in process337 331 Finished goods981 970 $1,729 $1,697 December 31,20202019Prepaid and Other Current AssetsPrepaid and other deferred charges (d)$516 $516 VAT recoverable261 275 Unrealized gains on derivatives (Note 12)110 85 Assets held for sale (Note 2)4 125 Other221 264 $1,112 $1,265 December 31,20202019Other Long-term AssetsPension assets (Note 16)$55 $78 Insurance contracts (e)61 75 Long-term receivables, net (f)201 150 Lease assets (Note 4)1,090 1,025 Deposits47 56 Investments carried at cost23 40 Deferred charges96 90 Deferred income taxes (Note 5) 268 243 Unrealized gains on derivatives (Note 12)90 82 Other217 174 $2,148 $2,013 December 31,20202019Other Current LiabilitiesAccrued expenses$1,226 $1,079 Payroll653 619 VAT payable336 268 Pension and postretirement (Note 16)34 27 Interest payable135 127 Lease liability (Note 4)275 260 Insurance reserves38 38 Unrealized losses on derivatives (Note 12)70 54 Noncontrolling interest redemption and dividend (Note 14)231 — Synergy cost accruals (Note 3)199 140 Other1,135 891 $4,332 $3,503 75Table of ContentsDecember 31,20202019Other Long-term LiabilitiesPension and postretirement (Note 16)$2,963 $2,548 Tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions (Note 5)355 342 Tax Act liabilities for deemed repatriation (Note 5)204 235 Lease liability (Note 4)794 716 Interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions (Note 5)99 65 Insurance reserves33 28 Asset retirement obligation302 293 Unrealized losses on derivatives (Note 12)11 45 Synergy cost accruals (Note 3)170 60 Other 588 556 $5,519 $4,888 December 31,20202019Deferred CreditsDeferred income taxes (Note 5) $6,704 $6,889 Other532 347 $7,236 $7,236 December 31,20202019Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Cumulative translation adjustment - net of taxes:Americas (g)$(3,788)$(3,357)EMEA (g)1,020 (136)APAC (g)616 (140)Engineering354 (29)Other(1,020)282 (2,818)(3,380)Derivatives – net of taxes4 (27)Pension/OPEB funded status obligation (net of $560 million and $446 million tax benefit in 2020 and 2019) (Note 16)(1,876)(1,407)$(4,690)$(4,814)(a)Depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 include $1,267 million and $653 million, respectively, of Linde AG purchase accounting impacts.

For the 2020 test, the company applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded. There were no indicators of impairment through December 31, 2020. 77NOTE 10.

The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, Praxair and Linde AG terminated their major respective existing revolving credit facilities. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020.On September 3, 2019 Linde and the company’s subsidiaries Linde, Inc. and Linde GmbH entered into a series of parent and subsidiary guarantees related to currently outstanding notes as well as the $5 billion Credit Agreement.Other Debt InformationAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.0% and 0.6%, respectively. Expected maturities of long-term debt are as follows:(Millions of dollars) 2021$751 20222,440 20231,853 20241,067 20251,083 Thereafter5,709 $12,903 As of December 31, 2020, the amount of Linde's assets pledged as collateral was immaterial.See Note 13 for the fair value information related to debt.NOTE 12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and energy costs. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.81Table of ContentsWhen a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency interest rate contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Counterparties to Linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes (""CSAs"") in place for certain entities with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2020, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for consolidated subsidiaries: Fair Value(Millions of dollars)Notional AmountsAssets (a)Liabilities (a)December 31,202020192020201920202019Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $6,470 $7,936 $72 $62 $48 $37 Forecasted transactions823 748 16 14 12 15 Cross-currency swaps260 1,029 24 35 7 40 Commodity contracts N/AN/A1 — — — Total$7,553 $9,713 $113 $111 $67 $92 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $— $27 $— $2 $— $3 Forecasted transactions355 464 20 9 14 3 Commodity contractsN/AN/A3 6 — 1 Interest rate swaps 1,923 1,908 64 39 — — Total Hedges$2,278 $2,399 $87 $56 $14 $7 Total Derivatives$9,831 $12,112 $200 $167 $81 $99 (a) Current assets of $110 million are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $90 million are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $70 million are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $11 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities. Balance Sheet ItemsForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.82Table of ContentsForecasted TransactionsForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Cross-Currency SwapsCross-currency swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond. Commodity Contracts Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. The fair value adjustments for the majority of these contracts are recorded to AOCI and are eventually offset by the income statement impact of the underlying commodity purchase. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. Net investment hedgesAs of December 31, 2020, Linde has €1.7 billion ($2.1 billion) intercompany Euro-denominated credit facility loans and intercompany loans which are designated as hedges of the net investment positions in foreign operations. Since hedge inception, exchange rate movements have increased the credit facility loan and intercompany loans by $344 million, with the offsetting loss shown within the cumulative translation component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Linde had previously designated Euro-denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges to reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments in foreign subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. Exchange rate movements of $206 million relating to the previously denominated Euro-denominated debt incurred in the financial periods prior to de-designation will remain in AOCI, until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. Exchange rate movements related to the Euro-denominated debt occurring after de-designation are shown in the consolidated statements of income.Interest Rate SwapsLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability. The notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps of Linde with maturity dates from 2021 through 2028 was $1,923 million at December 31, 2020 and $1,908 million at December 31, 2019 (see Note 11 for further information).Terminated Treasury Rate LocksThe unrecognized aggregate losses related to terminated treasury rate lock contracts on the underlying $500 million 2.20% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2022 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was immaterial in both periods. The unrecognized gains/(losses) for the treasury rate locks are shown in AOCI and are being recognized on a straight line basis to interest expense - net over the term of the underlying debt agreements. Impact of derivative instruments on earnings and AOCIThe following table summarizes the impact of the company's derivatives on the consolidated statements of income:83Table of Contents(Millions of dollars) Amount of Pre-Tax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings *December 31,202020192018Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging InstrumentsCurrency contracts:Balance sheet items:Debt-related$(125)$253 $(118)Other balance sheet items(40)65 3 Total$(165)$318 $(115)* The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net.The amounts of gain or loss recognized in AOCI and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net losses expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI within foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on treasury rate locks are recorded as a component of AOCI within derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are reclassified to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are required to be reclassified, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. The gains (losses) for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense –net on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the underlying debt.NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019: Fair Value Measurements Using(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3 202020192020201920202019AssetsDerivative assets$— $— $200 $167 $— $— Investments and securities *21 18 — — 47 28 Total$21 $18 $200 $167 $47 $28 LiabilitiesDerivative liabilities$— $— $81 $99 $— $— *Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not 84Table of Contentsbased on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.The level 3 investments and securities as of January 1, 2020 was $28 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020 there was approximately $3 million of foreign currency movement and $16 million in gains recognized in interest expense - net in the company's consolidated statements of income. The balance as of December 31, 2020 was $47 million.The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,611 million versus a carrying value of $12,903 million. At December 31, 2019 the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $12,375 million versus a carrying value of $12,224 million. As Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair value as of the merger date, differences between the carrying value and the fair value are not significant; remaining differences are attributable to interest rate increases subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.NOTE 14. EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTSLinde plc Shareholders’ EquityAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Linde has total authorized share capital of €1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each, 25,000 A ordinary shares of €1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of €0.001 each.At December 31, 2020 there were 552,012,862 and 523,294,529 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2020 there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.At December 31, 2019 there were 552,012,862 and 534,380,544 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding. Linde’s Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.Other Linde plc Ordinary Share and Treasury Stock TransactionsLinde may issue new ordinary shares for dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans and employee savings and incentive plans. The number of new Linde ordinary shares issued from the merger date through December 31, 2019 was 958,293 shares. No new ordinary shares were issued in 2020.On December 10, 2018 the Linde board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 6,385,887 shares through December 31, 2019 (4,068,642 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2018). Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2019.On January 22, 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 24,310,534 shares through December 31, 2020 (12,016,083 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2019). This program expired on February 1, 2021.On January 25, 2021 the Linde board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $5.0 billion of its ordinary shares expiring on July 31, 2023.Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. The decrease during 2020 primarily relates to the initiated buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa. As of December 31, 2020, the conditions of the buyout were met obligating the company to execute in January 2021. Therefore, the company 85Table of Contentsreclassified $196 million from non-controlling interest to other current liabilities reflecting the transaction price. An additional $35 million of dividends declared to the minority owners, reflected on the Dividends and other capital reductions line, was also reclassified to other current liabilities at December 31, 2020 and was paid in January 2021.The $2,921 million decrease during 2019 was primarily driven by completion of the cash merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer related to the merger (See Note 2).The $186 million decrease during 2018 primarily relates to the sale of Praxair's industrial gases business in Europe (see Note 2). The ""Impact of Merger"" line item of the consolidated statements of equity includes the fair value of the noncontrolling interests acquired from Linde AG, including the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer that were the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out completed in 2019 (See Note 2).Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company’s control (“redeemable noncontrolling interests”) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2020, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes an industrial gas business in EMEA where the noncontrolling shareholders have put options. The decrease of $100 million during 2020 relates to the full redemption of the industrial gas business in the Americas and redemption of the majority of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in the industrial gas business in EMEA.86Table of ContentsNOTE 15. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense was $133 million in 2020 ($95 million and $62 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $79 million in 2020 ($42 million and $30 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.Summary of Plans The Amended and Restated 2009 Linde Long-Term Incentive Plan was initially adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. on April 28, 2009 and has been amended since its initial adoption (""the 2009 Plan""). Upon completion of the business combination of Praxair, Inc. with Linde AG on October 31, 2018, the 2009 Plan was assumed by the company. The 2009 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, 5,117,443 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2009 Plan, of which 1,406,647 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.Upon the completion of the business combination, all options outstanding under the 2009 Plan were converted into options to acquire the same number of shares of the company and at the same exercise price per share that applied prior to the business combination.Exercise prices for options granted under the 2009 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2009 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. In connection with the business combination, on October 31, 2018 the company's Board of Directors adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan 2018 of Linde plc (“the LTIP 2018”), the purpose of which was to replace certain outstanding Linde AG equity based awards that were terminated. Under the LTIP 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128. As of December 31, 2020, 277,553 shares remained available for grant, and since the company was obligated to make these replacement awards only in 2019, it does not anticipate any further grants under this plan.Exercise prices for the replacement option rights that were granted in 2019 under the LTIP 2018 were equal to EUR 1.67 ($1.92 as converted at an exchange rate from the time the exchange offer was completed as the option rights are exercisable in U.S. dollars on the NYSE) as prescribed in the business combination agreement. Each replacement option right granted under the LTIP 2018 is subject to vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant Linde AG award that had been granted before the business combination. After vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year.In order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares. Stock Option Fair ValueThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2020 was $17.37 ($23.38 in 2019 and $19.29 in 2018) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The decrease in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to 87Table of Contentsthe reduction in the risk-free interest rate. The weighted-average fair value of replacement option rights granted in 2019 was $160.08 based on intrinsic value method.The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2020, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31,202020192018Dividend yield2.2 %2.0 %2.1 %Volatility15.8 %14.3 %14.4 %Risk-free interest rate0.60 %2.38 %2.67 %Expected term years665The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): ActivityNumber ofOptions(000’s)AverageExercisePriceAverageRemainingLifeAggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding at January 1, 20209,297 $127.04 Granted1,155 173.16 Exercised(2,205)115.34 Cancelled or expired(180)162.97 Outstanding at December 31, 20208,067 $136.05 6.0$1,028 Exercisable at December 31, 20205,707 $123.93 5.0$797 The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $263.51 as of December 31, 2020 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2020 was $264 million ($219 million and $113 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively).Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2020 was $36 million ($64 million and $66 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $70 million for 2020 ($56 million and $30 million cash tax benefit in 2019 and 2018, respectively). As of December 31, 2020, $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.Performance-Based and Restricted Stock AwardsIn 2020, the company granted 224,045 performance-based stock awards under the 2009 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital (""ROC"") performance or relative total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance versus that of the S&P 500 (weighted 67%) and Eurofirst 300 (weighted 33%). The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2020 was $161.56, and during 2019 was $168.47. These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. There were no ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2018.The weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2020 was $198.61, and during 2019 was $215.85, and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. There were no performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2018.There were 185,973 restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2020. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2020 was $174.95 ($165.04 in 2019 and $144.86 in 2018). These fair values are based 88Table of Contentson the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.The following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): Performance-BasedRestricted StockNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNon-vested at January 1, 2020246 $184.29 884 $129.43 Granted224 174.70 186 174.95 Vested— — (355)117.62 Cancelled and Forfeited(33)178.27 (27)160.90 Non-vested at December 31, 2020437 $179.76 688 $148.56 There are approximately 10 thousand performance-based shares and 12 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at December 31, 2020 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current share price. As of December 31, 2020, $42 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards and $21 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2023.NOTE 16. RETIREMENT PROGRAMSDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.Linde has two main U.S. retirement programs which are non-contributory defined benefit plans: the Linde U.S. Pension Plan and the CBI Pension Plan. The latter program benefits primarily former employees of CBI Industries, Inc. which Linde acquired in 1996. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time choice to remain covered by the old formula or to elect coverage under a new formula. The old formula is based predominantly on years of service, age and compensation levels prior to retirement, while the new formula provides for an annual contribution to an individual account which grows with interest each year at a predetermined rate. Also, this new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. and non-U.S. pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including U.S. and non-U.S. corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde’s international subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.Defined Benefit Pension Plans - InternationalLinde has international, defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the U.K. The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. Multi-employer Pension Plans89Table of ContentsIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (""MEPs""), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2026. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. Linde’s contributions to these plans were $2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2019 and 2018. Total 2020 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.Linde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (""PPA"") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. The PPA classifies MEPs as either Red, Yellow or Green Zone plans. Among other factors, plans in the Red Zone are generally less than 65 percent funded with a projected insolvency date within the next twenty years; plans in the Yellow Zone are generally 65 to 80 percent funded; and plans in the Green Zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. Red Zone plans are considered to be in ""critical"" or ""critical and declining"" status, while Yellow Zone plans are considered to be in ""endangered"" status. Plans that are in neither ""critical"" nor ""endangered"" status are considered to have Green Zone status. According to the most recent data available, four of the MEPs that the company participates in are in a Red Zone status and four are in a Green Zone status. As of December 31, 2020, the four Red Zone plans have pending or have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.Defined Contribution PlansLinde’s U.S. business employees are eligible to participate in the Linde defined contribution savings plan. Employees may contribute up to 40% of their compensation, subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations. For the U.S. packaged gases business, company contributions to this plan are calculated as a percentage of salary based on age plus service. U.S. employees other than those in the packaged gases business have company contributions to this plan calculated on a graduated scale based on employee contributions to the plan. The cost for these defined contribution plans was $46 million in 2020, $47 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2018 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow).The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (""ESOP"") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 1,872,450 at December 31, 2020.Certain international subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $106 million in 2020, $95 million in 2019 and $32 million in 2018 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow). Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Pension and Postretirement Benefit CostsThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (""OPEB"") costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the table below (2018 reflects the impact of the Linde AG merger on October 31, 2018 and the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business on December 3, 2018 (see Note 2)): 90Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,PensionsOPEB202020192018202020192018Amount recognized in Operating Profit Service cost$150 $142 $74 $2 $2 $2 Amount recognized in Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost Interest cost208 261 128 5 7 5 Expected return on plan assets(482)(462)(219)— — — Net amortization and deferral90 61 71 (4)(4)(3) Curtailment and termination benefits (a)— 8 — — — — Settlement charges (b)6 97 14 — — — $(178)$(35)$(6)$1 $3 $2 Amount recognized in Net gain on sale of businesses Settlement gains from divestitures (c)— — (44)— — — Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(28)$107 $24 $3 $5 $4 (a) In 2019, Linde recorded curtailment gains of $9 million and a charge of $17 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. (b) In the third quarter of 2020, Linde recorded a pension settlement charge of $6 million triggered by lump sum benefit payments made from a U.S. non-qualified plan. In the first quarter of 2019, benefits of $91 million were paid related to the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. Such benefits were triggered by a change in control provision and resulted in a settlement charge of $51 million. In the third and fourth quarters of 2019, Linde recorded pension settlement charges of $40 million and $6 million, respectively, related to lump sum payments made from a U.S. qualified plan. These payments were triggered by merger-related divestitures. 2018 includes the impact of a $4 million charge and a $10 million charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. In the third quarter, a series of lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan triggered a settlement of the related pension obligation. In the fourth quarter, a change in control provision triggered the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. (c) In connection with Praxair merger-related divestitures, primarily the European industrial gases business, certain European pension plan obligations were settled. This resulted in the recognition of associated pension benefit obligations and deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within operating profit in the ""Net gain on sale of businesses"" line item.Funded StatusChanges in the benefit obligation and plan assets for Linde’s pension and OPEB programs, including reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown below. 91Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions 20202019OPEBU.S.International U.S.International20202019Change in Benefit Obligation (""PBO"")Benefit obligation, January 1$2,552 $8,689 $2,508 $7,533 $192 $184 Service cost37 113 38 104 2 2 Interest cost68 140 81 180 5 7 Divestitures — — (1)— — — Participant contributions— 18 — 20 11 8 Plan amendment— 7 — 13 (13)— Actuarial loss (gain)250 893 266 1,045 (2)8 Benefits paid(152)(320)(105)(333)(22)(20)Plan settlement(9)(14)(235)— — — Plan curtailment— (1)— (9)— 2 Foreign currency translation and other changes— 462 — 136 (1)1 Benefit obligation, December 31$2,746 $9,987 $2,552 $8,689 $172 $192 Accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"")$2,646 $9,830 $2,464 $8,553 Change in Plan AssetsFair value of plan assets, January 1$2,048 $6,888 $1,952 $6,292 $— $— Actual return on plan assets386 641 341 598 — — Company contributions25 66 — 94 — — Participant contributions— 18 — 20 — — Benefits paid from plan assets(149)(267)(244)(268)— — Divestitures — — (1)— — — Foreign currency translation and other changes— 307 — 152 — — Fair value of plan assets, December 31$2,310 $7,653 $2,048 $6,888 $— $— Funded Status, End of Year$(436)$(2,334)$(504)$(1,801)$(172)$(192)Recorded in the Balance Sheet (Note 7)Other long-term assets$2 $53 $— $78 $— $— Other current liabilities(9)(13)(6)(10)(12)(11)Other long-term liabilities(429)(2,374)(498)(1,869)(160)(181)Net amount recognized, December 31$(436)$(2,334)$(504)$(1,801)$(172)$(192)Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of:Net actuarial loss (gain)$687 $1,766 $753 $1,110 $(11)$(10)Prior service cost (credit)— 9 — 4 (15)(4)Deferred tax benefit (Note 7)(182)(383)(190)(251)5 (5)Amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (Note 7)$505 $1,392 $563 $863 $(21)$(19)92Table of ContentsComparative funded status information as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 for select international pension plans is presented in the table below as the benefit obligations of these plans are considered to be significant relative to the total benefit obligation: United KingdomGermanyOther InternationalTotal International(Millions of dollars)2020202020202020Benefit obligation, December 31$6,012 $2,582 $1,393 $9,987 Fair value of plan assets, December 315,355 1,258 1,040 7,653 Funded Status, End of Year$(657)$(1,324)$(353)$(2,334) United KingdomGermanyOther InternationalTotal International(Millions of dollars)2019201920192019Benefit obligation, December 31$5,221 $2,180 $1,288 $8,689 Fair value of plan assets, December 314,777 1,119 992 6,888 Funded Status, End of Year$(444)$(1,061)$(296)$(1,801)The changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income in 2020 and 2019 are as follows: PensionsOPEB(Millions of dollars)2020201920202019Current year net actuarial losses (gains)*$598 $834 $(2)$8 Amortization of net actuarial gains (losses)(89)(59)2 3 Plan amendment7 (4)(13)— Amortization of prior service credits (costs)(1)(2)2 1 Pension settlements(6)(97)— — Curtailments(1)— — 2 Foreign currency translation and other changes87 12 (1)— Total recognized in other comprehensive income$595 $684 $(12)$14 ________________________ * Pension net actuarial losses in 2020 and 2019 are largely driven by lower discount rates across all significant pension plans. In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets in both 2020 and 2019 largely offset the actuarial loss generated from a higher PBO, resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience in both years. OPEB net actuarial gains in 2020 relate to the favorable impact of liability experience and demographic assumptions, which more than outweighed the adverse impact of lower year-over-year discount rates. OPEB net actuarial losses in 2019 relate to the low interest rate environment, which was partially offset by favorable actual benefit payment experience.

For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.00% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 7.7% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.4% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.3% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.4% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 9.5%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.9%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2021, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. For 2021, the expected weighted average long-term rate of return for international plans will be 5.27%.94Table of Contents OPEBAssumed healthcare cost trend rates20202019Historical Praxair, Inc. plansHealthcare cost trend assumed6.50 %7.00 %Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)5.00 %5.00 %Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate20272027Historical Linde AG plansHealthcare cost trend assumed 6.50 %5.49 %Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)5.00 %4.50 %Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate20272038Pension Plan AssetsThe investments of the U.S. pension plan are managed to meet the future expected benefit liabilities of the plan over the long term by investing in diversified portfolios consistent with prudent diversification and historical and expected capital market returns. Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The international pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for Linde’s U.S. and international pension plans, as well as respective asset allocation ranges by major asset category, are generally as follows: U.S.InternationalAsset CategoryTarget 2020Target 201920202019Target 2020Target 201920202019Equity securities40%-60%40%-60%66 %55 %15%-25%15%-25%27 %23 %Fixed income securities30%-50%30%-50%27 %30 %30%-50%30%-50%34 %41 %Other5%-15%5%-15%7 %15 %30%-50%30%-50%39 %36 %The following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Equity Securities – This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual Funds – These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. U.S. and International Government Bonds – This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and international government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Corporate Bonds – This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and international corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Pooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities. Bank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Liquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using observable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Insurance Contracts – This category is comprised of purchased annuity insurance contracts (annuity contract buy-ins) and is intended to mitigate the Company's exposure to certain risks, such as longevity risk. The fair value is calculated based on the cash surrender value of the purchased annuity insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Real Estate Funds – This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Private Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. ContributionsAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, 97Table of Contentspension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $91 million in 2020, $94 million in 2019 and $87 million in 2018. Estimated required contributions for 2021 are currently expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company’s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).Contingent LiabilitiesLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.Significant matters are:•During 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During 2009, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.•At December 31, 2020 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $205 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. •On September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$2.2 billion Brazilian reais ($423 million) on White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. The fine was reduced to R$1.7 billion Brazilian reais ($327 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against White Martins was overturned by the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE has filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice and a decision is pending.Similarly, on September 1, 2010, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$237 million Brazilian reais ($46 million) on Linde Gases Ltda., the former Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde AG, which was divested to MG Industries GmbH on March 1, 2019 and with respect to which Linde provided a contractual indemnity. The fine was reduced to R$188 million Brazilian reais ($36 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against Linde Gases Ltda. was overturned by the Seventh Federal Court in Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Seventh Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice, and a final decision is pending.Linde has strong defenses and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fines overturned. Linde strongly believes that the allegations of anticompetitive activity against our current and former Brazilian 99Table of Contentssubsidiaries are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence. Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserves have been recorded as management does not believe that a loss from this case is probable. •On and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (Landgericht) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG’s minority shareholders for €189.46 per share. Any such increase would apply to all 14,763,113 Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims lack merit, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.CommitmentsAt December 31, 2020, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $2,905 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including non-U.S. litigation matters.Other commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 4, 5, 11, and 16).NOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. Similarly, total assets have not been included as this is not provided to the CODM for their assessment. The table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reflect the results of the combined business for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date).100Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)202020192018Sales (a)Americas$10,459 $10,989 $8,017 EMEA6,449 6,643 2,644 APAC5,687 5,779 2,446 Engineering2,851 2,799 459 Other1,797 1,953 1,270 Total Segment Sales27,243 28,163 14,836 Merger-related divestitures— 65 — Total Sales$27,243 $28,228 $14,836 202020192018Segment Operating ProfitAmericas$2,773 $2,577 $2,053 EMEA1,465 1,367 481 APAC1,277 1,184 465 Engineering435 390 14 Other(153)(246)(37)Reported Segment operating profit5,797 5,272 2,976 Cost reduction programs and other charges (Note 3)(506)(567)(309)Net gain on sale of business— 164 3,294 Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG(1,969)(1,952)(714)Merger-related divestitures— 16 — Total operating profit$3,322 $2,933 $5,247 202020192018Depreciation and AmortizationAmericas$1,196 $1,195 $860 EMEA723 749 269 APAC619 613 271 Engineering36 35 5 Other132 143 79 Segment depreciation and amortization2,706 2,735 1,484 Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG1,920 1,940 346 Total depreciation and amortization$4,626 $4,675 $1,830 202020192018Capital Expenditures and AcquisitionsAmericas$1,425 $1,814 $1,068 EMEA670 738 329 APAC1,214 1,231 372 Engineering13 79 27 Other146 45 112 Total Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions$3,468 $3,907 $1,908 101Table of Contents202020192018Sales by Major CountryUnited States$8,475 $8,604 $5,942 Germany3,740 3,630 868 China2,061 2,005 1,032 United Kingdom1,595 1,653 398 Australia1,071 1,127 183 Brazil822 994 1,003 Other – International9,479 10,215 5,410 Total sales$27,243 $28,228 $14,836 202020192018Long-lived Assets by Major Country (b)United States$7,777 $7,498 $7,189 Germany2,394 2,429 2,411 China2,413 2,254 2,237 United Kingdom1,313 1,479 1,582 Australia1,105 1,214 1,476 Brazil734 956 1,012 Other – International12,976 13,234 13,810 Total long-lived assets$28,711 $29,064 $29,717 ________________________(a)Sales reflect external sales only and include Linde AG sales from the merger date of October 31, 2018 forward.

REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.Contracts with CustomersApproximately 83% of Linde's consolidated sales are generated from industrial gases and related products in three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA, and APAC) and the remaining 17% is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 18 for operating segment details). Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. Industrial GasesWithin each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.Following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies: 102Table of ContentsOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. Linde Engineering The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance 103Table of Contentsunder the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $162 million at December 31, 2020 and $368 million at December 31, 2019. Total contract liabilities are $2,301 million at December 31, 2020 (current of $1,769 million and $532 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Total contract liabilities were $2,106 million at December 31, 2019 (current contract liabilities of $1,758 million and $348 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2019 was $1,283 million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business acquired in the merger. The industrial gases business does not typically have material contract assets or liabilities.Payment Terms and OtherLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.Disaggregated Revenue InformationAs described above and in Note 18, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing. The following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reflect the results of the combined business for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date).(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2020SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$2,839 $1,870 $2,005 $— $145 $6,859 25 %On-Site2,513 1,354 2,049 — — 5,916 22 %Packaged Gas5,034 3,175 1,559 — 22 9,790 36 %Other73 50 74 2,851 1,630 4,678 17 %$10,459 $6,449 $5,687 $2,851 $1,797 $27,243 100 %(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2019SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOther (a)Total%Merchant$2,945 $1,856 $2,080 $— $184 $7,065 25 %On-Site2,757 1,434 2,020 — — 6,211 22 %Packaged Gas5,183 3,347 1,542 — 19 10,091 36 %Other104 6 137 2,799 1,815 4,861 17 %$10,989 $6,643 $5,779 $2,799 $2,018 $28,228 100 %104Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2018SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$2,775 $832 $826 $— $119 $4,552 31 %On-Site2,405 536 1,156 — — 4,097 28 %Packaged Gas2,800 1,271 443 — 3 4,517 30 %Other37 5 21 459 1,148 1,670 11 %$8,017 $2,644 $2,446 $459 $1,270 $14,836 100 % (a) Other/Other includes $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 of merger-related divestitures that have been excluded from segment sales.Remaining Performance ObligationsAs described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. The company estimates the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $46 billion. This amount excludes all sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next five years and the remaining thereafter.NOTE 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEffective January 1, 2021, Linde deconsolidated a joint venture with operations in Taiwan, due to the expiration of certain contractual rights that the parties mutually agreed not to renew. The joint venture contributed sales of approximately $600 million in 2020. From the effective date, the joint venture will be reflected as an equity investment on Linde's consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding results reflected in income from equity investments on the consolidated statement of income. The deconsolidation will not have an impact on earnings per share as the ownership percent remains the same.105Table of ContentsITEM 9.

The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. Linde’s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2021 84% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 16% are related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.Linde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North and South America (""Americas"")Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)Asia and Pacific (“APAC”)United StatesGermanyChinaBrazilUnited KingdomAustraliaMexicoEastern EuropeSouth KoreaCanadaSouth AfricaIndiaThe company manufactures and distributes its industrial gas products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States and China. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company’s customer base. The majority of Linde’s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.19Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK2021 Year in review•Sales of $30,793 million were 13% above 2020 sales of $27,243 million. Volume growth across all end markets and project start-ups increased sales by 8% . Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Favorable currency translation and higher cost pass-through increased sales by 5%, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which decreased sales by 3% . •Reported operating profit of $4,984 million was 50% above 2020. Adjusted operating profit of $7,176 million was 24% above 2020. The increase in both reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and other charges and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC.*•Income from continuing operations of $3,821 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.32 increased from $2,497 million and $4.70, respectively in 2020. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $5,579 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.69 were 28% and 30%, respectively above 2020 adjusted amounts.*•Cash flow from operations of $9,725 million was 31% above 2020. Capital expenditures were $3,086 million; dividends paid were $2,189 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $4,562 million; and debt repayments, net were $514 million.*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section in this MD&A.2022 OutlookLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

Volume growth across all end markets and project start ups increased sales by 8%. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Currency translation increased sales by 2%, largely in EMEA and APAC, driven by the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound against the U.S. dollar. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, increased sales by 3%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Divestitures decreased sales by 3% primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $2,160 million, or 14%, for the year primarily due to higher volumes, cost pass-through and currency impacts, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 57.0% and 56.5% of sales, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher cost pass-through.Selling, general and administrative expensesSelling, general and administrative expense (""SG&A"") decreased $4 million, from $3,193 in 2020 to $3,189 million in 2021. SG&A was 10.4% of sales in 2021 versus 11.7% in 2020, primarily due to continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher cost pass-through on sales. Currency impacts increased SG&A by approximately $62 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&A decreased due to continued productivity initiatives. Depreciation and amortizationReported depreciation and amortization expense increased $9 million versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts, partially offset by a decrease related primarily to intangible assets acquired in the merger becoming fully amortized.On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $66 million, or 2%, versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts which increased depreciation and amortization by approximately $60 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying depreciation was relatively flat as the impact of new project start ups was largely offset by the decrease related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Cost reduction programs and other chargesLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $273 million and $506 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the company's cost reduction program, which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted basis, these costs have been excluded in both periods. Operating profitReported operating profit increased $1,662 million in 2021, or 50%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%, for 2021 versus 2020.22Table of ContentsOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $1,662 million, or 50% in 2021. The increase in the year was driven by higher volumes and price, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. Cost reduction programs and other charges were $273 million in 2021 and $506 million in 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.Interest expense - netReported interest expense – net in 2021 decreased $38 million, or 33%, versus 2020 . On an adjusted basis interest expense decreased $54 million, or 29% in 2021 as compared to 2020.On both a reported and adjusted basis, the decrease year over year was driven by a lower effective borrowing rate and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on an unhedged intercompany loan in the prior year.Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service costReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $192 million and $177 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in benefit largely relates to a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).Effective tax rateThe reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2021 was 24.7% versus 25.0% in 2020. The decrease is primarily driven by increased pre-tax income and jurisdictional mix. 2021 includes a deferred income tax charge related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities for a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom, offset by a reduction to tax expense related to uncertain tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of $47 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2021 was 24.1% versus 23.8% in 2020. The increase in the adjusted ETR is primarily due to lower tax benefits in 2021 relative to higher pre-tax income.Income from equity investmentsReported income from equity investments for 2021 was $119 million as compared to $85 million in 2020. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2021 was $231 million versus $142 million in 2020. On a reported basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021, partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segment in the third quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021. Noncontrolling interests from continuing operationsAt December 31, 2021, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $10 million, from $125 million in 2020 to $135 million in 2021, primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa.Adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $36 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa, which more than offset the increase from higher income from continuing operations.Income from continuing operationsReported income from continuing operations increased $1,324 million, or 53%, primarily due to higher overall operating profit. 23Table of ContentsOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other non-GAAP adjustments, income from continuing operations increased $1,208 million, or 28%, in 2021 versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $2.62, or 56%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $10.69 in 2021 increased 30% versus 2020. The increase on both reported and adjusted basis was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding.EmployeesThe number of employees at December 31, 2021 was 72,327, a decrease of 3%, or 1,880 employees from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by cost reduction actions and divestitures. Other Financial DataEBITDA increased to $9,738 million in 2021 from $8,033 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $10,179 million for 2021 as compared to $8,645 million in 2020, primarily due to higher income from continuing operations versus the prior year period. See the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $358 million resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,175 million largely offset by an increase in the funded status of the company's retirement obligations of $746 million driven by a higher discount rate environment and strong asset performance. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. See the ""Currency"" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment.Related Party TransactionsThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.Environmental MattersLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. Climate ChangeLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions, and Linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, several other countries worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the company's customers and Linde operations, including regulations in China, Singapore and the European Union. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.24Table of ContentsLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering GHG emissions. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.To manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. Linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. Effective November 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for Board oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.At the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples of such factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.Costs Relating to the Protection of the EnvironmentEnvironmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.Retirement BenefitsPensionsThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was a benefit of $35 million and $28 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and costs of $107 million in 2019. 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of $97 million related to lump sum payments, which were triggered by either a change in control provision or merger-related divestitures, and a net curtailment charge of $8 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $135 million and $436 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a deficit of $1,409 million and $2,334 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S. 25Table of Contentsplans derived the benefit from the actual return on plan assets, as well as favorability generated from a lower PBO due to an increase in discount rates. Global pension contributions were $42 million in 2021, $91 million in 2020, and $94 million in 2019. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2021 are currently expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.Linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2022 of 7.00% and 5.54% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios. Excluding the impact of any settlements, 2022 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $91 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.InsuranceLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers’ compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States, $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. In addition, the company self retains risk up to €5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate €5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had recorded a total of $75 million and $71 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company’s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.Linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.26Table of ContentsSEGMENT DISCUSSIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business which designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources.

CurrencyThe results of Linde’s non-U.S. operations are translated to the company’s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies used in the countries in which the company operates. For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde’s results of operations in any given period.To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of 2021Statements of IncomeBalance Sheets ConsolidatedAverage Year Ended December 31,December 31,CurrencySales2021202020212020Euro21 %0.85 0.88 0.88 0.82 Chinese yuan9 %6.45 6.90 6.36 6.53 British pound7 %0.73 0.78 0.74 0.73 Australian dollar4 %1.33 1.45 1.38 1.30 Brazilian real4 %5.39 5.11 5.58 5.20 Korean won3 %1,144 1,178 1,189 1,087 Canadian dollar3 %1.25 1.34 1.26 1.27 Mexican peso2 %20.28 21.35 20.53 19.91 Indian rupee2 %73.91 74.08 74.34 73.07 Republic of South African rand2 %14.77 16.37 15.94 14.69 Swedish krona1 %8.58 9.18 9.05 8.23 Thailand bhat1 %31.93 31.28 33.40 29.96 Russian ruble1 %73.69 71.95 74.68 74.04 31Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31,20212020Net Cash Provided by (Used for)Operating ActivitiesIncome from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests)$3,956 $2,622 Non-cash charges (credits): Add: Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments (a)98 258 Add: Depreciation and amortization4,635 4,626 Add (Less): Deferred income taxes(254)(369) Add (Less): non-cash charges and other 109 285 Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash charges and other8,544 7,422 Less: Pension contributions(42)(91)Add (Less): Working capital1,148 364 Add (Less): Other75 (266)Net cash provided by operating activities$9,725 $7,429 Investing ActivitiesCapital expenditures$(3,086)$(3,400)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired(88)(68)Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested167 482 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(3,007)$(2,986)Financing ActivitiesDebt increases (decreases) – net$(514)$1,313 Issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares – net(4,562)(2,410)Cash dividends – Linde plc shareholders(2,189)(2,028)Noncontrolling interest transactions and other(323)(220)Net cash (used) for financing activities$(7,588)$(3,345)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash$(61)$(44)Cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period$2,823 $3,754 ____________________(a)See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Cash decreased $931 million in 2021 versus 2020. The primary sources of cash in 2021 were cash flows from operations of $9,725 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $3,086 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $4,562 million, and cash dividends to shareholders of $2,189 million. Cash Flows From Operations 2021 compared with 2020Cash flows from operations was $9,725 million, an increase of $2,296 million, or 31% from 2020. The increase was driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower working capital requirements, including an increase in contract liabilities due to engineering customer advanced payments, which more than offset higher cash taxes. Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments was $98 million and $258 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing charges of $273 million and $506 million net of related cash outflows of $175 million and $248 million, respectively, in each period. 32Table of ContentsInvesting2021 compared with 2020Net cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.Capital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment. At December 31, 2021 , Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $3.5 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.Acquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.Divestitures and asset sales in 2021 totaled $167 million as compared to $482 million in 2020. The 2020 period includes net proceeds from merger-related divestitures of $98 million from the sale of selected assets of Linde China and proceeds of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.FinancingLinde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).Cash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.The company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.Linde’s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $11,384 million, $1,016 million lower than $12,400 million at December 31, 2020. The December 31, 2021 net debt balance includes $13,069 million in public securities, $1,138 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $2,823 million of cash. Linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 1.4% for 2021. 33Table of ContentsIn June 2021, Linde repaid €600 million of 3.875% notes that became due. In September 2021, Linde issued €700 million of 0.000% notes due 2026, €500 million of 0.375% notes due 2033, and €700 million of 1.000% notes due 2051. In November 2021, Linde repaid $600 million of 2.45% notes that were due in 2022. There was no impact to interest within the consolidated statements of income (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). In January 2022, Linde repaid €1.0 billion of 0.250% notes that became due in 2022.On February 28, 2022, the company’s Board of Directors approved the additional repurchase of $10.0 billion of its ordinary shares. For additional information related to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2021, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde’s Audit Committee.Revenue RecognitionLong-Term Construction Contracts The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenues for sale of equipment contracts are generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. The result is applied to total expected revenue and results in financial statement recognition of revenue in addition to costs incurred to date. Any expected loss on a contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.The cost incurred input method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. The key source of estimation uncertainty is the total estimated costs at completion including material, labor and overhead costs and the resultant state of completion of the contracts. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimation process, including technical complexity, duration of construction cycle, potential cost inflation (whether equipment or manpower), and scope considerations all of which may affect the total estimation process. Changes in these estimates may lead to a significant impact on future financial statements.Pension BenefitsPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including long-term inflation rates, employee turnover, retirement age, and 34Table of Contentsmortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year.The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.00% for U.S. plans and 5.28% for non-U.S. plans for the year ended December 31, 2021 (7.00% and 5.31%, respectively at December 31, 2020). The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. and Non-U.S. plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $46 million.The company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $9,612 million, or $804 million lower than the fair value of assets of $10,416 million at December 31, 2021. These net deferred investment losses of $804 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.Discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. The company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant U.S. and non-U.S. plans using the spot rate approach. U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining Non-U.S. plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2021 benefit costs. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would increase Linde’s pension expense by approximately $52 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of $47 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $951 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $841 million. The weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.55% for non-U.S. plans at December 31, 2021 (3.25% and 2.55%, respectively, at December 31, 2020). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $8 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $54 million.Asset ImpairmentsGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles AssetsAt December 31, 2021, the company had goodwill of $27,038 million and $1,813 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated no impairment. At December 31, 2021, Linde’s enterprise value was approximately $188 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus net debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $57 billion.The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to 35Table of Contentstheir carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. Management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2021 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the 2018 Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.See Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a collection of distribution related assets (cylinders, distribution centers, and stores) or be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. Income TaxesAt December 31, 2021, Linde had deferred tax assets of $1,829 million (net of valuation allowances of $235 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $7,826 million. At December 31, 2021, uncertain tax positions totaled $387 million (see Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $1,262 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or about 24.7% of pre-tax income (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions. The company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.ContingenciesThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.36Table of ContentsLinde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.37Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company’s financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.The non-GAAP measures in the following reconciliations are presented in this MD&A.Adjusted Amounts(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)Year Ended December 31,20212020Adjusted Operating Profit and Operating MarginReported operating profit$4,984 $3,322 Add: Cost reduction programs and other charges273 506 Add: Purchase accounting impacts -

Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchasing accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements.A summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows:Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the periods presented relate primarily to depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger and the allocation of fair value step-up for ongoing Linde AG asset disposals (reflected in Other Income/(Expense)). Adjusted Interest Expense - Net: Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.Adjusted Income from Equity Investments: Represents the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets. Adjusted Noncontrolling Interests from Continuing Operations: Represents the noncontrolling interests’ ownership portion of the adjustments described above determined on an entity by entity basis.(d) Impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segmentNet Debt and Adjusted Net DebtNet debt is a financial liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to evaluate the ability of a company to repay its debt.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Note 1 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2021. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2021, Linde had debt totaling $14,207 million ($16,154 million at December 31, 2020). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2021, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,492 million and floating-rate debt of $1,715 million, representing 88% and 12%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2020, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,365 million and floating-rate debt of $5,789 million, representing 64% and 36%, respectively, of total debt. Fixed Rate DebtIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate, interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2021, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $834 million ($674 million in 2020). A one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $37 million decrease to derivative assets recorded.Variable Rate DebtAt December 31, 2021, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $33 million ($44 million in 2020).Foreign Currency RiskLinde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in Latin America (primarily Brazil and Mexico), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the U.K.), Canada, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and China) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2021, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $5,870 million ($7,553 million at December 31, 2020) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Holding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% increase in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately $28 million and at December 31, 2020 would decrease by approximately $99 million, which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.44Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Revenue Recognition9545Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLinde’s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.Linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGLinde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 as stated in their report./s/ STEPHEN F.

WhiteChief Financial Officer February 28, 202246Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plcOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.47Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at CompletionAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,867 million of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 was generated from sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimated costs at completion and management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions involved evaluating management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates and significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPStamford, ConnecticutFebruary 28, 2022We have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1992.48Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

integral part of these financial statements54Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESLinde plc (""Linde"" or ""the company"") is an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland. Linde’s registered office is located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland. Linde’s principal executive offices are located at The Priestley Centre, 10 Priestley Road, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XY, United Kingdom and 10 Riverview Drive, Danbury, Connecticut, United States. Linde trades on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol LIN.Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("" U.S. GAAP"") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.Operations – Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde’s Engineering business offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including supplying plant components and services directly to customers.Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 19 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies. Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment – Net – Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes labor, applicable overhead and interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are also capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 8). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.The company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.Asset-Retirement Obligations – An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at fair 55Table of Contentsvalue and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company’s asset-retirement obligations are primarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation – For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 7). Financial Instruments – Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Provided the hedge remains highly effective, any ineffectiveness is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.See Note 12 for additional information relating to financial instruments.Goodwill – Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. The qualitative analysis of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021 showed the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value, as such further analysis was not performed. See Note 9 for additional information relating to goodwill.Other Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying 56Table of Contentscharacteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred. See Note 10 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – Assets held for sale, as well as liabilities directly related to these assets, are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets as held for sale if the requirements of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are satisfied. The main requirements of ASC 360 are: (i) management having the authority to approve the action has committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (ii) the assets are available for sale in their present condition at a reasonable market price, and (iii) a sale within the next twelve months is probable. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Amortization and depreciation has been discontinued. The process involved in determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.Discontinued operations are reported as soon as a business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and when the business to be disposed of represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the company’s operations and financial results. Businesses acquired with the intent of divesting are also required to be reported as discontinued operations. The profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations. The information provided in the Notes relates to continuing operations. If the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted accordingly.Income Taxes – Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.Under the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. See Note 5 for additional information relating to income taxes.Retirement Benefits – Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees’ expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices. See Note 16 for additional information relating to retirement programs.Share-based Compensation– The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. See Note 15 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.Reclassifications – Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.57Table of ContentsRecently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Implemented in 2021 •Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes - In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing several exceptions in the current standard and adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, such as requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date, evaluating whether a step-up in tax basis of goodwill relates to a business combination or a separate transaction and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements.•Reference Rate Reform - In March 2020 with amendments in 2021, the FASB issued guidance related to reference rate reform which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions that the reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates. This update is applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. The amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through December 31, 2022. The application of this guidance did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2. Business Combination and DivestituresMerger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AGOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company.Linde AG Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily Americas Industrial Gases BusinessAs a condition of the U.S. regulatory approval of the merger, Linde AG agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in the Americas, as described below:•The Linde AG Americas Sales and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as and further amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018, and February 20, 2019 whereby Linde AG and Praxair, Inc. entered into an agreement with a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII to sell the majority of Linde AG’s industrial gases business in North America and certain industrial gases business activities of Linde AG's in South America for $2.9 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold businesses. In addition, divestitures include $0.5 billion of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the Americas under other agreements. These transactions were completed on March 1, 2019.•On April 30, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde South Korea with the sale price of $1.2 billion to IMM Private Equity Inc., to satisfy requirements of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The assets divested include bulk and on-site business in Giheung, Pohang and Seosan sites as well as oxygen and nitrogen on-site generators.•On December 16, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde India with a sale price of $193 million. •In March 2020, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde China with a sale price of $98 million.58Table of ContentsDiscontinued OperationsOnly the sales of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures meet the criteria for discontinued operations, Praxair merger-related divestitures do not qualify as discontinued operations. As such, operations related to the Linde AG merger-related divestitures are included within Income from discontinued operations, net of tax for periods subsequent to the merger, as summarized below:Millions of dollars202120202019Net sales$5 $7 $449 Cost of sales1 3 251 Other operating costs1 1 43 Operating profit$3 $3 $155 Income from equity investments2 1 8 Income taxes— — 54 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax$5 $4 $109 Noncontrolling interests— — (7)Income from continuing operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interests$5 $4 $102 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 there were no material amounts of capital expenditures or significant operating or investing non-cash items related to discontinued operations.Non-Merger Related AcquisitionsNon-merger related acquisitions of $88 million, $68 million and $225 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were primarily related to the Americas and are not material, individually or in the aggregate.Non-Merger Related DivestituresEffective January 1, 2021, Linde deconsolidated a joint venture with operations in APAC, due to the expiration of certain contractual rights that the parties mutually agreed not to renew. From the effective date, the joint venture is reflected as an equity investment on Linde's consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding results reflected in income from equity investments on the consolidated statement of income.The fair value of the joint venture at January 1, 2021 was determined using a discounted cash flow model and approximated the carrying amount of its net assets. The net carrying value of $852 million was mainly comprised of assets of approximately $1.9 billion (primarily Other intangibles and Property plant and equipment - net), net of liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion. Upon deconsolidation an equity investment was recorded representing Linde's share of the joint venture's net assets. The deconsolidation resulted in a gain of $52 million recorded within cost reduction programs and other charges (see Note 3) related to the release of the CTA balance recorded within AOCI. The company did not receive any consideration, cash or otherwise, as part of the deconsolidation.The joint venture contributed sales of approximately $600 million in 2020. Future earnings per share will not be affected as the ownership percent remains the same. NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER CHARGESCost reduction programs and other charges were $273 million, $506 million, and $567 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. After tax and noncontrolling interests, charges were $279 million, $372 million, and $444 million for the same respective periods. The following tables provide a summary of the pre-tax charges by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:59Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2021(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotalAmericas$4 $2 6 (6)$— EMEA204 33 237 1 238 APAC16 12 28 (50)(22)Engineering20 6 26 — 26 Other15 26 41 (10)31 Total$259 $79 $338 $(65)$273 Year Ended December 31, 2020(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotalAmericas$35 $24 59 13 $72 EMEA131 21 152 3 155 APAC7 2 9 3 12 Engineering38 28 66 4 70 Other87 18 105 92 197 Total$298 $93 $391 $115 $506 Year Ended December 31, 2019(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotalAmericas$36 $20 56 34 $90 EMEA105 16 121 21 142 APAC40 10 50 72 122 Engineering1 12 13 (9)4 Other22 42 64 145 209 Total$204 $100 $304 $263 $567 Cost Reduction ProgramsIn 2019, Linde initiated a cost reduction program, which represents charges of achieving synergies and cost efficiencies expected from the merger of Praxair and Linde AG (see Note 2). Total charges related to the cost reduction programs were $338 million ($253 million, after tax), $391 million ($277 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests), and $304 million ($233 million, after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Severance costsDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, severance costs of $259 million were recorded for the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions. Severance costs of $298 million and $204 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were recorded for the elimination of approximately 3,100 and 2,400 positions, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the actions have been taken, with the remaining actions planned to be completed within the next 12 months. Other cost reduction chargesOther cost reduction charges were $79 million, $93 million, and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These amounts primarily represent charges related to the execution of the company's 60Table of Contentssynergistic actions including location consolidations and business rationalization projects, software and process harmonization, and associated non-recurring costs.Merger-Related Costs and Other ChargesMerger-related costs and other charges were a benefit of $65 million ($26 million, after tax) and charges of $115 million ($95 million, after tax) and $263 million ($211 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The 2021 pretax benefit was primarily due to a $52 million gain triggered by a joint venture deconsolidation in the APAC segment in the first quarter (see Note 2). After-tax charges also include the impact of the below items.2021 after-tax charges include a net income tax charge of $56 million, primarily related to (i) $83 million of expense due to the revaluation of a net deferred tax liability resulting from a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom which was enacted in the second quarter, and (ii) a tax settlement benefit of $33 million. 2021 also includes an impairment charge of $35 million ($35 million, after tax) related to a joint venture in the APAC segment. The charge is shown within income from equity investments in the consolidated statements of income.2019 includes other charges for an asset impairment related to a joint venture in APAC of approximately $73 million ($42 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling. Cash RequirementsTotal cash requirements of the cost reduction program and other charges incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 are estimated to be approximately $259 million, of which $175 million was paid through December 31, 2021. Remaining cash requirements are expected to be paid through 2023. Total cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 also reflect the impact of cash payments of liabilities, including merger-related tax liabilities, accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The following table summarizes the activities related to the company's cost reduction programs and other charges during 2020 and 2021:(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotalBalance, December 31, 2019$117 $16 $133 $67 $200 2020 Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges298 93 391 115 506 Less: Cash payments(156)(20)(176)(45)(221)Less: Non-cash charges— (68)(68)(82)(150)Foreign currency translation and other24 1 25 9 34 Balance, December 31, 2020$283 $22 $305 $64 $369 2021 Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges259 79 338 (65)273 Less: Cash payments(138)(15)(153)(22)(175)Less: Non-cash charges— (41)(41)54 13 Foreign currency translation and other(20)(7)(27)— (27)Balance, December 31, 2021$384 $38 $422 $31 $453 Classification in the consolidated financial statements The pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded as other current or long-term liabilities (see Note 7). On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 18 Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.61Table of ContentsNOTE 4. LEASESIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Linde determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Total lease and rental expenses related to operating lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $317 million, and $341 million respectively. Operating leases costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Total lease and rental expenses related to finance lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $51 million and $44 million, respectively, and the costs are included in depreciation and amortization and interest. Related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Linde includes renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Operating and financing lease expenses above include short term and variable lease costs which are immaterial.As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, Linde uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Linde determines incremental borrowing rates through market sources. The company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases that meet the short-term lease definition are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance. The company does not have material variable lease payments.Gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial. Operating cash flows used for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $290 million and $317 million, respectively. Cash flows used for finance leases for the same period were immaterial.

After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances. 65Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, the company had $358 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $235 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $266 million relating to NOLs of which $84 million expire within 5 years, $53 million expire after 5 years and $129 million have no expiration. The deferred tax assets also include $92 million related to credits of which $5 million expire within 5 years, $83 million expire after 5 years, and $4 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $235 million primarily relate to NOLs and are required because management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the NOLs will be utilized before they expire. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.The company has $586 million of non-U.S. income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2021. A provision has not been made for any additional non-U.S. income tax at December 31, 2021 on approximately $32 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $32 billion could become subject to additional non-U.S. income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary, or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.Uncertain Tax PositionsUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $387 million, $452 million and $472 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (Millions of dollars)202120202019Unrecognized income tax benefits, January 1$452 $472 $319 Additions for tax positions of prior years (a)11 35 151 Reductions for tax positions of prior years(11)(34)(3)Additions for current year tax positions19 11 33 Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (b)(60)(39)(26)Foreign currency translation and other(24)7 (2)Unrecognized income tax benefits, December 31$387 $452 $472 ________________________(a)Increase primarily relates to tax positions in the United States and Europe, $66 million in 2019 related to the merger with Linde AG.(b)Settlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty. The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest benefit of $15 million, and expense of $29 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The company had $40 million and $99 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 7). 66Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below: Major tax jurisdictionsOpen YearsNorth and South AmericaUnited States2017 through 2021Canada2014 through 2021Mexico2014 through 2021Brazil2003 through 2021Europe and AfricaFrance2014 through 2021Germany2016 through 2021Republic of South Africa2018 through 2021Spain2010 through 2021United Kingdom2016 through 2021Asia and AustraliaAustralia2017 through 2021China2016 through 2021India2006 through 2021South Korea2016 through 2021The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.NOTE 6.

These expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default rates for each business, taking regional circumstances into account. If necessary, these historical default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. The loss rates are also evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability of the receivables. Gross trade receivables aged less than one year were $4,425 million and $4,169 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and gross receivables aged greater than one year were $329 million and $358 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Gross other receivables were $150 million and $111 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Receivables aged greater than one year are generally fully reserved unless specific circumstances warrant exceptions, such as those backed by federal governments. Provisions for expected credit losses were $129 million, $182 million and $170 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The allowance activity in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 related to write-offs of uncollectible amounts, net of recoveries and currency movements is not material.69Table of ContentsDecember 31,20212020InventoriesRaw materials and supplies$399 $411 Work in process334 337 Finished goods1,000 981 $1,733 $1,729 December 31,20212020Prepaid and Other Current AssetsPrepaid and other deferred charges (d)$527 $516 VAT recoverable196 261 Unrealized gains on derivatives (Note 12)101 110 Assets held for sale (Note 2)— 4 Other146 221 $970 $1,112 December 31,20212020Other Long-term AssetsPension assets (Note 16)$139 $55 Insurance contracts (e)46 61 Long-term receivables, net (f)105 201 Lease assets (Note 4)1,016 1,090 Deposits43 47 Investments carried at cost18 23 Deferred charges62 96 Deferred income taxes (Note 5) 242 268 Unrealized gains on derivatives (Note 12)35 90 Other278 217 $1,984 $2,148 December 31,20212020Other Current LiabilitiesAccrued expenses$1,248 $1,226 Payroll710 653 VAT payable295 336 Pension and postretirement (Note 16)38 34 Interest payable102 135 Lease liability (Note 4)262 275 Insurance reserves19 38 Unrealized losses on derivatives (Note 12)27 70 Noncontrolling interest redemption and dividend (Note 14)— 231 Synergy cost accruals (Note 3)200 199 Other998 1,135 $3,899 $4,332 70Table of ContentsDecember 31,20212020Other Long-term LiabilitiesPension and postretirement (Note 16)$1,802 $2,963 Tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions (Note 5)302 355 Tax Act liabilities for deemed repatriation (Note 5)178 204 Lease liability (Note 4)747 794 Interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions (Note 5)40 99 Insurance reserves56 33 Asset retirement obligation305 302 Unrealized losses on derivatives (Note 12)8 11 Synergy cost accruals (Note 3)253 170 Other 497 588 $4,188 $5,519 December 31,20212020Deferred CreditsDeferred income taxes (Note 5) $6,239 $6,704 Other759 532 $6,998 $7,236 December 31,20212020Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Cumulative translation adjustment - net of taxes:Americas (g)$(3,985)$(3,788)EMEA (g)94 1,020 APAC (g)154 616 Engineering24 354 Other(280)(1,020)(3,993)(2,818)Derivatives – net of taxes75 4 Pension/OPEB funded status obligation (net of $305 million and $560 million tax benefit in 2021 and 2020) (Note 16)(1,130)(1,876)$(5,048)$(4,690)(a)Depreciation and amortization expense in 2021 include $1,245 million and $618 million, respectively, of Linde AG purchase accounting impacts.

For the 2021 test, the company applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded. There were no indicators of impairment through December 31, 2021. 72NOTE 10.

The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.Other Debt InformationAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.0% in both years.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy and commodity costs. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On 76Table of Contentsan ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, through the use of a qualitative assessment, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Counterparties to Linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes (""CSAs"") in place for certain entities with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2021, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for consolidated subsidiaries: Fair Value(Millions of dollars)Notional AmountsAssets (a)Liabilities (a)December 31,202120202021202020212020Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $4,427 $6,470 $22 $72 $17 $48 Forecasted transactions537 823 6 16 11 12 Cross-currency swaps148 260 21 24 4 7 Commodity contracts N/AN/A— 1 — — Total$5,112 $7,553 $49 $113 $32 $67 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $— $— $— $— $— $— Forecasted transactions758 355 14 20 3 14 Commodity contractsN/AN/A49 3 — — Interest rate swaps 1,251 1,923 24 64 — — Total Hedges$2,009 $2,278 $87 $87 $3 $14 Total Derivatives$7,121 $9,831 $136 $200 $35 $81 (a) December 31, 2021 and 2020 included current assets of $101 million and $110 million, which are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $35 million and $90 million, which are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $27 million and $70 million, which are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $8 million and $11 million, which are recorded in other long-term liabilities. Balance Sheet ItemsForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.Forecasted TransactionsForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional 77Table of Contentscurrency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Cross-Currency SwapsCross-currency interest rate swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond. Commodity Contracts Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. Net Investment HedgesAs of December 31, 2021, Linde has €4.2 billion ($4.8 billion) Euro-denominated notes and intercompany loans that are designated as hedges of the net investment positions in foreign operations. Since hedge inception, the deferred gain recorded within cumulative translation adjustment component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is $140 million (deferred gain of $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2021).As of December 31, 2021, exchange rate movements relating to previously designated hedges that remain in AOCI is a loss of $42 million. These movements will remain in AOCI, until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the related foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. Interest Rate SwapsLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability. The notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps of Linde with maturity dates from 2022 through 2028 was $1,251 million at December 31, 2021 and $1,923 million at December 31, 2020 (see Note 11 for further information).Terminated Treasury Rate LocksThe unrecognized aggregated losses related to terminated treasury rate lock contracts on the underlying $500 million 2.20% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2022 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were immaterial in both periods. The unrecognized gains/(losses) for the treasury rate locks are shown in AOCI and are being recognized on a straight line basis to interest expense - net over the term of the underlying debt agreements. Derivatives Impact on Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following table summarizes the impact of the company's derivatives on the consolidated statements of income:(Millions of dollars) Amount of Pre-Tax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings *December 31,202120202019Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging InstrumentsCurrency contracts:Balance sheet items:Debt-related$42 $(125)$253 Other balance sheet items(5)(40)65 Total$38 $(165)$318 * The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as 78Table of Contentsinterest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net.The amounts of gain or loss recognized in AOCI and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net losses expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020: Fair Value Measurements Using(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3 202120202021202020212020AssetsDerivative assets$— $— $136 $200 $— $— Investments and securities *42 21 — — 20 47 Total$42 $21 $136 $200 $20 $47 LiabilitiesDerivative liabilities$— $— $35 $81 $— $— *Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.Changes in level 3 investments and securities were immaterial.The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. At December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,219 million versus a carrying value of $13,044 million. At December 31, 2020 the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,611 million versus a carrying value of $12,903 million. Differences between the carrying value and the fair value are attributable to fluctuations in interest rates subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.79Table of ContentsNOTE 14. EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTSLinde plc Shareholders’ EquityAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, Linde has total authorized share capital of €1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each, 25,000 A ordinary shares of €1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of €0.001 each.At December 31, 2021 there were 552,012,862 and 508,680,879 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2021 there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.At December 31, 2020 there were 552,012,862 and 523,294,529 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2020, there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding. Linde’s Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.Other Linde plc Ordinary Share and Treasury Share TransactionsLinde may issue new ordinary shares for dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans and employee savings and incentive plans. The number of new Linde ordinary shares issued from the merger date through December 31, 2019 was 958,293 shares. No new ordinary shares were issued in 2020 or 2021.On December 10, 2018 the Linde board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 6,385,887 shares through December 31, 2019 (4,068,642 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2018). Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2019.On January 22, 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 24,847,354 shares through December 31, 2021 (24,310,534 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2020). This program expired on February 1, 2021.On January 25, 2021 the company's board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $5.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 15,103,335 shares through December 31, 2021. This program is set to expire on July 31, 2023.On February 28, 2022 the Linde board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $10.0 billion of its ordinary shares expiring on July 31, 2024.Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. The decrease during 2021 is primarily related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2). The decrease during 2020 primarily relates to the initiated buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa. As of December 31, 2020, the conditions of the buyout were met obligating the company to execute in January 2021. Therefore, the company reclassified $196 million from non-controlling interest to other current liabilities reflecting the transaction price. An additional $35 million of dividends declared to the minority owners, reflected on the Dividends and other capital reductions line, was also reclassified to other current liabilities at December 31, 2020 and was paid in January 2021.The $2,921 million decrease during 2019 was primarily driven by the completion of the cash merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer related to the merger.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company’s control (“redeemable noncontrolling interests”) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes an industrial gas business in EMEA where the noncontrolling shareholders have put options. 80Table of ContentsNOTE 15. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense was $128 million in 2021 ($133 million and $95 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $64 million in 2021 ($79 million and $42 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.Summary of Plans The 2021 Linde plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan"") was adopted by the Board of Directors and shareholders of Linde plc on July 26, 2021. Upon adoption of the 2021 Plan, any authorized shares that remained available for grant for new awards under the Amended and Restated 2009 Linde Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”) were cancelled. The 2021 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, 8,995,710 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2021 Plan, of which 2,995,710 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.Exercise prices for options granted under the 2021 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2021 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. In connection with the business combination, on October 31, 2018 the company's Board of Directors adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan 2018 of Linde plc (“the LTIP 2018”), the purpose of which was to replace certain outstanding Linde AG equity based awards that were terminated. Under the LTIP 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128. As of December 31, 2021, 285,113 shares remained available for grant, and since the company was obligated to make these replacement awards only in 2019, no further grants will be made under this plan.Exercise prices for the replacement option rights that were granted in 2019 under the LTIP 2018 were equal to EUR 1.67 ($1.92 as converted at an exchange rate from the time the exchange offer was completed as the option rights are exercisable in U.S. dollars on the NYSE) as prescribed in the business combination agreement. Each replacement option right granted under the LTIP 2018 is subject to vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant Linde AG award that had been granted before the business combination. After vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year.In order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares. Stock Option Fair ValueThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2021 was $37.80 ($17.37 in 2020 and $23.38 in 2019) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to the increase in the stock price. The weighted-average fair value of replacement option rights granted in 2019 was $160.08 based on intrinsic value method.The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2021, 2020 and 2019: 81Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31,202120202019Dividend yield1.7 %2.2 %2.0 %Volatility18.4 %15.8 %14.3 %Risk-free interest rate1.10 %0.60 %2.38 %Expected term years666The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2021 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): ActivityNumber ofOptions(000’s)AverageExercisePriceAverageRemainingLifeAggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding at January 1, 20218,067 $136.05 Granted831 253.68 Exercised(1,672)121.40 Cancelled or expired(60)207.35 Outstanding at December 31, 20217,166 $152.56 6.0$1,389 Exercisable at December 31, 20215,297 $132.84 5.0$1,131 The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $346.43 as of December 31, 2021 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2021 was $294 million ($264 million and $219 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively).Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2021 was $50 million ($36 million and $64 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $64 million for 2021 ($70 million and $56 million cash tax benefit in 2020 and 2019, respectively). As of December 31, 2021, $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.Performance-Based and Restricted Stock AwardsIn 2021, the company granted 187,830 performance-based stock awards under the 2009 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital (""ROC"") performance or relative total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance versus that of the S&P 500 (weighted 67%) and Eurofirst 300 (weighted 33%). The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2021 was $241.10 ( $161.56 in 2020 and $168.47 in 2019). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2021 was $301.04 ($198.61 in 2020 and $215.85 in 2019) and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. There were 175,597 restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2021. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2021 was $242.60 ($174.95 in 2020 and $165.04 in 2019). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.82Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of December 31, 2021 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): Performance-BasedRestricted StockNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNon-vested at January 1, 2021437 $179.76 688 $148.56 Granted188 262.56 176 242.60 Vested— — (213)147.84 Cancelled and Forfeited(15)221.70 (15)206.65 Non-vested at December 31, 2021610 $204.39 636 $172.90 There are approximately 14 thousand performance-based shares and 15 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at December 31, 2021 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations.

RETIREMENT PROGRAMSDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.The Linde retirement plans are non-contributory defined benefit plans covering eligible employees and its participating affiliates. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between a traditional benefit (the “Traditional Design”) and an account-based benefit (the “Account-Based Design”). The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant’s career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde’s non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.Linde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. Multi-employer Pension PlansIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (""MEPs""), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective 83Table of Contentsbargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2026. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2020 and 2019. Total 2021 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.Linde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (""PPA"") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. As of December 31, 2021, there were four Red Zone plans, deemed to be in ""critical"" or ""critical and declining"" status that have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans and such obligation would be immaterial. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.Defined Contribution Plans Linde’s U.S. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution savings plans offered by their applicable business. Employee contribution percentages vary by plan and are subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations.The cost for these defined contribution plans was $51 million in 2021, $46 million in 2020 and $47 million in 2019 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow).The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (""ESOP"") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 1,761,608 at December 31, 2021.Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $101 million in 2021, $106 million in 2020 and $95 million in 2019 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow). Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Pension and Postretirement Benefit CostsThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (""OPEB"") costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the table below: (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,PensionsOPEB202120202019202120202019Amount recognized in Operating Profit Service cost$155 $150 $142 $2 $2 $2 Amount recognized in Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost Interest cost151 208 261 3 5 7 Expected return on plan assets(521)(482)(462)— — — Net amortization and deferral176 90 61 (5)(4)(4) Curtailment and termination benefits (a)— — 8 — — — Settlement charges (b)4 6 97 — — — $(190)$(178)$(35)$(2)$1 $3 Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(35)$(28)$107 $— $3 $5 (a) In 2019, Linde recorded curtailment gains of $9 million and a charge of $17 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. (b) Linde recorded a pension settlement charge of $4 million and $6 million during the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Settlement charges were triggered by lump sum benefit payments made from a U.S. non-qualified plan.84Table of ContentsIn the first quarter of 2019, benefits of $91 million were paid related to the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. Such benefits were triggered by a change in control provision and resulted in a settlement charge of $51 million. In the third and fourth quarters of 2019, Linde recorded pension settlement charges of $40 million and $6 million, respectively, related to lump sum payments made from a U.S. qualified plan. These payments were triggered by merger-related divestitures.

For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.00% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 7.7% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.4% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.3% expected return). For the non-U.S. plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.4% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.2% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 10.8%. For the non-U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 9.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as a factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2022, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. For 2022, the expected weighted average long-term rate of return for non-U.S. plans will be 5.54%.

Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The non-U.S. pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for Linde’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, as well as respective asset allocation ranges by major asset category, are generally as follows: U.S.Non-U.S.Asset CategoryTarget 2021Target 202020212020Target 2021Target 202020212020Equity securities40%-60%40%-60%66 %66 %15%-25%15%-25%27 %27 %Fixed income securities30%-50%30%-50%25 %27 %30%-50%30%-50%35 %34 %Other5%-15%5%-15%9 %7 %30%-50%30%-50%38 %39 %The following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Equity Securities – This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and non-U.S. companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or non-U.S. exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual Funds – These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. Emerging Market Debt - This category includes fixed income debt issued by countries with developing economies as well as by corporations within those nations. They typically have higher yields but lower credit ratings relative to developed country corporate and government bonds. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.U.S. and Non-U.S. Government Bonds – This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and non-U.S. government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Corporate Bonds – This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Pooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities. Bank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 90Table of ContentsLiquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using observable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Insurance Contracts – This category is comprised of purchased annuity insurance contracts (annuity contract buy-ins) and is intended to mitigate the Company's exposure to certain risks, such as longevity risk. The fair value is calculated based on the cash surrender value of the purchased annuity insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Real Estate Funds – This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Private Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. ContributionsAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $42 million in 2021, $91 million in 2020 and $94 million in 2019. Estimated required contributions for 2022 are currently expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company’s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).Contingent LiabilitiesLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.Significant matters are:•During 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During 2009, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.•At December 31, 2021 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $200 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. •On September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of $2.2 billion Brazilian reais ($395 million) on White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde Inc. The fine was reduced to $1.7 billion Brazilian reais ($305 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against White Martins was overturned by the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE has filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice and a decision is pending.Similarly, on September 1, 2010, CADE imposed a civil fine of $237 million Brazilian reais ($43 million) on Linde Gases Ltda., the former Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde AG, which was divested to MG Industries GmbH on March 1, 2019 and with respect to which Linde provided a contractual indemnity. The fine was reduced to $188 million Brazilian reais ($34 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against Linde Gases Ltda. was overturned by the Seventh Federal Court in Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Seventh Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice, and a final decision is pending.Linde has strong defenses and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fines overturned. Linde strongly believes that the allegations of anticompetitive activity against our current and former Brazilian 92Table of Contentssubsidiaries are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence. Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserves have been recorded as management does not believe that a loss from this case is probable. •On and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (Landgericht) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG’s minority shareholders for €189.46 per share. Any such increase would apply to all 14,763,113 Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims lack merit, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.CommitmentsAt December 31, 2021, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $3,695 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including non-U.S. litigation matters.Other commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 4, 5, 11, and 16).NOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. Similarly, total assets have not been included as this is not provided to the CODM for their assessment. The table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 93Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)202120202019Sales (a)Americas$12,103 $10,459 $10,989 EMEA7,643 6,449 6,643 APAC6,133 5,687 5,779 Engineering2,867 2,851 2,799 Other2,047 1,797 1,953 Total Segment Sales30,793 27,243 28,163 Merger-related divestitures— — 65 Total Sales$30,793 $27,243 $28,228 202120202019Segment Operating ProfitAmericas$3,368 $2,773 $2,577 EMEA1,889 1,465 1,367 APAC1,502 1,277 1,184 Engineering473 435 390 Other(56)(153)(246)Reported Segment operating profit7,176 5,797 5,272 Cost reduction programs and other charges (Note 3)(273)(506)(567)Net gain on sale of business— — 164 Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG(1,919)(1,969)(1,952)Merger-related divestitures— — 16 Total operating profit$4,984 $3,322 $2,933 202120202019Depreciation and AmortizationAmericas$1,243 $1,196 $1,195 EMEA752 723 749 APAC611 619 613 Engineering39 36 35 Other127 132 143 Segment depreciation and amortization2,772 2,706 2,735 Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG1,863 1,920 1,940 Total depreciation and amortization$4,635 $4,626 $4,675 202120202019Capital Expenditures and AcquisitionsAmericas$1,354 $1,425 $1,814 EMEA669 670 738 APAC995 1,214 1,231 Engineering25 13 79 Other131 146 45 Total Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions$3,174 $3,468 $3,907 94Table of Contents202120202019Sales by Major CountryUnited States$9,123 $8,475 $8,604 Germany3,601 3,740 3,630 China2,562 2,061 2,005 United Kingdom2,060 1,595 1,653 Australia1,307 1,071 1,127 Brazil1,065 822 994 Other – non-U.S.11,075 9,479 10,215 Total sales$30,793 $27,243 $28,228 202120202019Long-lived Assets by Major Country (b)United States$7,659 $7,777 $7,498 Germany2,003 2,394 2,429 China2,385 2,413 2,254 United Kingdom1,078 1,313 1,479 Australia872 1,105 1,214 Brazil705 734 956 Other – non-U.S.11,301 12,976 13,234 Total long-lived assets$26,003 $28,711 $29,064 ________________________(a)Sales reflect external sales only.

REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.Contracts with CustomersLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. Industrial GasesWithin each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.Following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies: On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline 95Table of Contentsmay be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. Linde Engineering The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $134 million at December 31, 2021 and $162 million at December 31, 2020. Total contract liabilities are $3,699 million at December 31, 2021 (current of $2,940 million and $759 million within other long-96Table of Contentsterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Total contract liabilities were $2,301 million at December 31, 2020 (current contract liabilities of $1,769 million and $532 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2020 was $1,173 million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business.Payment Terms and OtherLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.Disaggregated Revenue InformationAs described above and in Note 18, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing.The following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2021SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$3,279 $2,227 $2,181 $— $173 $7,860 26 %On-Site3,225 1,824 2,296 — — 7,345 24 %Packaged Gas5,456 3,539 1,532 — 24 10,551 34 %Other143 53 124 2,867 1,850 5,037 16 %$12,103 $7,643 $6,133 $2,867 $2,047 $30,793 100 %(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2020SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$2,839 $1,870 $2,005 $— $145 $6,859 25 %On-Site2,513 1,354 2,049 — — 5,916 22 %Packaged Gas5,034 3,175 1,559 — 22 9,790 36 %Other73 50 74 2,851 1,630 4,678 17 %$10,459 $6,449 $5,687 $2,851 $1,797 $27,243 100 %(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2019SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOther (a)Total%Merchant$2,945 $1,856 $2,080 $— $184 $7,065 25 %On-Site2,757 1,434 2,020 — — 6,211 22 %Packaged Gas5,183 3,347 1,542 — 19 10,091 36 %Other104 6 137 2,799 1,815 4,861 17 %$10,989 $6,643 $5,779 $2,799 $2,018 $28,228 100 % (a) Other includes $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 of merger-related divestitures that have been excluded from segment sales.97Table of ContentsRemaining Performance ObligationsAs described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. The company estimates the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $57 billion. This amount excludes all sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next five years and the remaining thereafter.98Table of ContentsITEM 9.

The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. Linde’s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2022 86% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 14% are related largely to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.Linde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North and South America (""Americas"")Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)Asia and Pacific (“APAC”)United StatesGermanyChinaBrazilUnited KingdomAustraliaMexicoEastern EuropeSouth KoreaCanadaIndiaThe company manufactures and distributes its industrial gas products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States and China. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company’s customer base. The majority of Linde’s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.19Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK2022 Year in review•Sales of $33,364 million were 8% above 2021 sales of $30,793 million. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 7% to sales. Cost pass-through increased sales by 6% with minimal impact on operating profit. Volume increased sales by 1%. Currency translation decreased sales by 5%, largely in EMEA and APAC. Divestitures decreased sales by 1%.•Reported operating profit of $5,369 million was 8% above 2021. Adjusted operating profit of $7,904 million was 10% above 2021. The increase in the reported operating profit was primarily due to higher pricing, productivity initiatives and lower depreciation and amortization driven by merger related assets, which more than offset Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges and the adverse impacts of inflation and currency in the year. The increase in adjusted operating profit increase was primarily due to higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the adverse impacts of inflation and currency in the year.* •Income from continuing operations of $4,147 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.23 increased from $3,821 million and $7.32, respectively in 2021. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $6,195 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $12.29 were 11% and 15%, respectively above 2021 adjusted amounts.*•Cash flow from operations of $8,864 million was $861 million below 2021. The decrease was driven by higher working capital requirements, including lower inflows from contract liabilities from engineering customer advanced payments, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non cash charges. Capital expenditures were $3,173 million; dividends paid were $2,344 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $5,132 million; and debt borrowings, net were $4,475 million. *A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section in this MD&A.2023 OutlookLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 7% to sales. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, increased sales by 6%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Volume growth in all end markets, except healthcare, and startups increased sales by 1%. Currency translation decreased sales by 5%, largely in EMEA and APAC, driven by the weakening of the Euro, Chinese yuan, British pound and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures decreased sales by 1%. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $1,907 million, or 11%, for the year primarily due to inflation and higher volumes, partially offset by productivity gains and currency effects. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 58.3% and 57.0% of sales, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher cost pass-through to customers. Selling, general and administrative expensesSelling, general and administrative expense (""SG&A"") decreased $82 million, from $3,189 in 2021 to $3,107 million in 2022. SG&A was 9.3% of sales in 2022 versus 10.4% in 2021. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $127 million in 2022. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&A increased primarily due to higher costs. Depreciation and amortizationReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $431 million, or 9% versus 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger and currency impacts.On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $49 million, or 2%, versus 2021. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $123 million in 2022. Excluding currency impacts, underlying depreciation and amortization increased including new project start ups. Russia-Ukraine conflict and other chargesRussia-Ukraine conflict and other charges were $1,029 million and $273 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charge for 2022 relates primarily to the deconsolidation and impairment of Russian subsidiaries resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine and related sanctions recorded as of June 30, 2022. 2021 charges relate to cost reduction program and other charges, primarily severance (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted basis, these benefits and costs have been excluded in both periods.Operating profitReported operating profit increased $385 million in 2022, or 8%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $728 million, or 10%, for 2022 versus 2021. On a reported basis, operating profit increased $385 million, or 8% in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher pricing, volumes, savings from productivity initiatives, and lower depreciation and amortization driven by merger related 22Table of Contentsassets. These increases more than offset the adverse impacts of inflation and currency in the year as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges of $1,029 million. Cost reduction programs and other charges was $273 million in 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting as well as Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges, operating profit increased $728 million, or 10%. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing, volumes and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of inflation and currency during the period. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.Interest expense - netReported interest expense – net in 2022 decreased $14 million, or 18%, versus 2021. On an adjusted basis interest expense decreased $32 million, or 25% in 2022 as compared to 2021.On both a reported and adjusted basis, the decrease year over year was driven primarily by higher interest income on cash deposits, partially offset by higher borrowing costs on short-term debt. Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service costReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $237 million and $192 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in benefit primarily relates to lower amortization of deferred losses, partially offset by higher interest cost reflective of the higher discount rate environment year-over-year (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).Effective tax rateThe reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2022 was 25.9% versus 24.7% in 2021. The increase in the rate is primarily related to the net tax expense resulting from the deconsolidation and impairment of the company’s business in Russia in 2022. 2021 included a deferred income tax charge related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities for a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2022 was 24.2% versus 24.1% in 2021.Income from equity investmentsReported income from equity investments for 2022 was $172 million as compared to $119 million in 2021. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2022 was $247 million versus $231 million in 2021.On a reported basis, the year-over-year increase in income from equity investments was due to a $35 million impairment charge taken in the third quarter of 2021 related to a joint venture in the APAC segment. On an adjusted basis, the year-over-year increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the overall performance of investments in APAC. Noncontrolling interests from continuing operationsAt December 31, 2022, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in APAC (primarily in China). Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $1 million, from $135 million in 2021 to $134 million in 2022.Adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021.Income from continuing operationsReported income from continuing operations increased $326 million, or 9%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges, income from continuing operations increased $616 million, or 11%, in 2022 versus 2021. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.91, or 12%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $12.29 in 2022 increased 15% versus 2021. The increase on both reported and adjusted basis was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding.EmployeesThe number of employees at December 31, 2022 was 65,010, a decrease of 10%, or 7,317 employees from 2021, primarily driven by the sale of GIST business, cost reduction initiatives and the deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries in the EMEA and Engineering segments. 23Table of ContentsOther Financial DataEBITDA from continuing operations increased to $9,745 million in 2022 from $9,738 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $10,873 million for 2022 as compared to $10,179 million in 2021, primarily due to higher adjusted income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization versus the prior period.See the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a loss of $778 million resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,835 million, partially offset by an increase in the funded status of the company's retirement obligations of $1,070 million driven by a higher discount rate environment. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. See the ""Currency"" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment.Related Party TransactionsThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.Environmental MattersLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which for the most part are used to help customers reduce their emissions. Worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. Climate ChangeLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and therefore faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions to which Linde, its suppliers and customers are subject to. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, several other countries worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the company and its customers, including regulations in China, Singapore and the European Union. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.Linde anticipates continued growth in hydrogen sales due to increased focus on decarbonization projects. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.To manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. 24Table of ContentsLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing low-carbon source energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. In 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean energy and carbon management.At the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. For example, in 2022, several pieces of legislation were enacted, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., which provides for investments in decarbonization opportunities including hydrogen projects. Other factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can help customers lower emissions by reducing energy consumption and increasing product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.Costs Relating to the Protection of the EnvironmentEnvironmental protection costs in 2022 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2022, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.Retirement BenefitsPensionsThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was a benefit of $110 million, $35 million and $25 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $238 million and $271 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $208 million and deficit of $1,430 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans derived the benefit from a lower PBO due to an increase in discount rates. Global pension contributions were $51 million in 2022, $42 million in 2021, and $91 million in 2020. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2023 are currently expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.Linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2023 of 7.00% and 5.60% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios. Excluding the impact of any settlements, 2023 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $118 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.25Table of ContentsInsuranceLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers’ compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States, $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. In addition, the company self retains risk up to €5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate €5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had recorded a total of $71 million and $75 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company’s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.Linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.26Table of ContentsSEGMENT DISCUSSIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment, which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources.

For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde’s results of operations in any given period.To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of 2022Statements of IncomeBalance Sheets ConsolidatedAverage Year Ended December 31,December 31,CurrencySales2022202120222021Euro21 %0.95 0.85 0.93 0.88 Chinese yuan8 %6.72 6.45 6.90 6.36 British pound6 %0.81 0.73 0.83 0.74 Australian dollar4 %1.44 1.33 1.47 1.38 Brazilian real4 %5.16 5.39 5.28 5.58 Korean won3 %1,286 1,144 1,266 1,189 Canadian dollar3 %1.36 1.25 1.36 1.26 Mexican peso2 %20.10 20.28 19.50 20.53 Indian rupee2 %78.49 73.91 82.73 74.34 Republic of South African rand1 %16.30 14.77 17.04 15.94 Swedish krona1 %10.08 8.58 10.43 9.05 Thailand bhat1 %34.96 31.93 34.61 33.40 32Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31,20222021Net Cash Provided by (Used for)Operating ActivitiesIncome from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests)$4,281 $3,956 Non-cash charges (credits): Add: Russia-Ukraine and other charges, net of payments (a)902 98 Add: Depreciation and amortization4,204 4,635 Add (Less): Deferred income taxes(383)(254) Add (Less): Non-cash charges and other 58 109 Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash charges and other9,062 8,544 Less: Pension contributions(51)(42)Add (Less): Working capital(310)1,148 Add (Less): Other163 75 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities$8,864 $9,725 Investing ActivitiesCapital expenditures$(3,173)$(3,086)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired(110)(88)Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested195 167 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(3,088)$(3,007)Financing ActivitiesDebt increases (decreases) – net$4,475 $(514)Issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares – net(5,132)(4,562)Cash dividends – Linde plc shareholders(2,344)(2,189)Noncontrolling interest transactions and other(88)(323)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(3,089)$(7,588)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash$(74)$(61)Cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period$5,436 $2,823 ____________________(a)See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Cash increased $2,613 million in 2022 versus 2021. The primary sources of cash in 2022 were cash flows from operations of $8,864 million and debt borrowings, net of $4,475 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $3,173 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $5,132 million, cash dividends to shareholders of $2,344 million.2022 compared with 2021Cash Flows From Operations Cash flows from operations was $8,864 million, a decrease of $861 million from 2021. The decrease was driven primarily by higher working capital requirements, including lower inflows from contract liabilities from engineering customer advanced payments, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non cash charges. Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges, net of payments, were $902 million and $98 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing charges of $1,029 million and $273 million net of related cash outflows of $127 million and $175 million, respectively, in each period. As of December 31, 2022, Linde has approximately $1.7 billion recorded in contract liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet related to engineering projects in Russia. Any obligation to satisfy the related residual contract liabilities may have an adverse effect on Linde’s cash flows.33Table of ContentsInvestingNet cash used for investing activities was $3,088 million in 2022 compared to $3,007 million in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $3,173 million, an increase of $87 million from 2021. Capital expenditures during 2022 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for operating and growth requirements. Approximately 52% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 27% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment. At December 31, 2022 , Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $5.7 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.Acquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2022 were $110 million, an increase of $22 million from 2021. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $88 million. Acquisitions in each period related primarily to the Americas and EMEA. On January 6, 2023, Linde purchased the remaining 77.2% ownership interest in nexAir, LLC in an all cash transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $0.8 billion (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested in 2022 were $195 million as compared to $167 million in 2021. Divestiture proceeds for the year include cash received from the sale of the company's GIST business of $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). FinancingLinde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).Cash used for financing activities was $3,089 million in 2022 compared to $7,588 million in 2021. Cash provided by debt was $4,475 million in 2022 versus cash used for debt of $514 million in 2021 primarily driven by higher commercial paper borrowings and debt issuances in 2022. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $5,132 million in 2022 versus $4,562 million in 2021. Cash dividends increased to $2,344 million in 2022 versus $2,189 million in 2021 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share to $4.68 per share from $4.24 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 versus cash used of $323 million for the respective 2021 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in 2021.The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2022, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt activity in 2022, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2022 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.The company maintains a $5 billion and a $1.5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2022. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.Linde’s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $12,478 million, $1,094 million higher than $11,384 million at December 31, 2021. The December 31, 2022 net debt balance includes $17,561 million in public securities, and $353 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $5,436 million of cash. Linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 1.7% for 2022. 34Table of ContentsIn January 2022, Linde repaid €1.0 billion of 0.250% notes that became due. In March 2022, Linde issued €500 million of 1.000% notes due 2027, €750 million of 1.375% notes due 2031, and €800 million of 1.625% notes due 2035. In May 2022, Linde repaid $500 million of 2.20% notes due in August 2022. In November 2022, Linde issued $300 million of 4.80% notes due in 2024 and $600 million of 4.70% notes due in 2025.On February 28, 2022, the company’s Board of Directors approved the additional repurchase of $10.0 billion of its ordinary shares. For additional information related to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde’s Audit Committee.Revenue RecognitionLong-Term Construction Contracts The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenues for sale of equipment contracts are generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. The result is applied to total expected revenue and results in financial statement recognition of revenue in addition to costs incurred to date. Any expected loss on a contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.The cost incurred input method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. The key source of estimation uncertainty is the total estimated costs at completion including material, labor and overhead costs and the resultant state of completion of the contracts. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimation process, including technical complexity, duration of construction cycle, potential cost inflation (whether equipment or manpower), and scope considerations all of which may affect the total estimation process. Changes in these estimates may lead to a significant impact on future financial statements.35Table of ContentsPension BenefitsPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including long-term inflation rates, employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year.The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.00% for U.S. plans and 5.60% for non-U.S. plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 (7.00% and 5.28%, respectively at December 31, 2021). The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. and Non-U.S. plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $44 million.The company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $8,898 million, or $1,213 million higher than the fair value of assets of $7,685 million at December 31, 2022. These net deferred investment gains of $1,213 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.Discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. The company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant U.S. and non-U.S. plans using the spot rate approach. U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining Non-U.S. plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2022 benefit costs. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would increase Linde’s pension expense by approximately $22 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of $96 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $462 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $417 million. The weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.59% for non-U.S. plans at December 31, 2022 (3.25% and 2.55%, respectively, at December 31, 2021). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $6 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $28 million.Asset ImpairmentsGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles AssetsAt December 31, 2022, the company had goodwill of $25,817 million and $1,706 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name. 36Table of ContentsThe company performs a goodwill impairment test annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated no impairment. At December 31, 2022, Linde’s enterprise value was approximately $173 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus net debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $54 billion.The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. Management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2022 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the 2018 Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.See Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a collection of distribution related assets (cylinders, distribution centers, and stores) or be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesAt December 31, 2022, Linde had deferred tax assets of $1,247 million (net of valuation allowances of $276 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $6,903 million. At December 31, 2022, uncertain tax positions totaled $325 million (see Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $1,434 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or about 25.9% of pre-tax income (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions. The company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.37Table of ContentsContingenciesThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.Linde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.38Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company’s financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.The non-GAAP measures in the following reconciliations are presented in this MD&A.Adjusted Amounts(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)Year Ended December 31,20222021Adjusted Operating Profit and Operating MarginReported operating profit$5,369 $4,984 Add: Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges (a)1,029 273 Add: Purchase accounting impacts -

Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchasing accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements.A summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows:Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the periods presented relate primarily to depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger and the allocation of fair value step-up for ongoing Linde AG asset disposals (reflected in Other Income/(Expense)). Adjusted Interest Expense - Net: Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Note 1 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2022. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2022, Linde had debt totaling $17,914 million ($14,207 million at December 31, 2021). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2022, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $13,000 million and floating-rate debt of $4,914 million, representing 73% and 27%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2021, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,492 million and floating-rate debt of $1,715 million, representing 88% and 12%, respectively, of total debt.Fixed Rate DebtIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate, interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2022, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $666 million ($834 million in 2021). A one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $21 million decrease to derivative assets recorded.Variable Rate DebtAt December 31, 2022, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $25 million ($33 million in 2021).Foreign Currency RiskLinde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in Latin America (primarily Brazil and Mexico), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the U.K.), Canada, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and China) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2022, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $3,870 million ($5,870 million at December 31, 2021) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Holding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% increase in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately $83 million and at December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately $28 million, which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.45Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Subsequent Events9846Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLinde’s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.Linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGLinde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as stated in their report./s/ Sanjiv Lamba/s/ KELCEY E.

WhiteChief Financial Officer February 28, 202347Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plcOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.48Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at CompletionAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,762 million of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 was generated from the sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from the sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimated costs at completion and management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions involved evaluating management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates and significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPStamford, ConnecticutFebruary 28, 2023We have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1992.49Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOMELINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) Year Ended December 31,202220212020Sales$33,364 $30,793 $27,243 Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization19,450 17,543 15,383 Selling, general and administrative3,107 3,189 3,193 Depreciation and amortization4,204 4,635 4,626 Research and development143 143 152 Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges1,029 273 506 Other income (expenses) – net(62)(26)(61)Operating Profit5,369 4,984 3,322 Interest expense – net63 77 115 Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost(237)(192)(177)Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments5,543 5,099 3,384 Income taxes on continuing operations1,434 1,262 847 Income From Continuing Operations Before Equity Investments4,109 3,837 2,537 Income from equity investments172 119 85 Income From Continuing Operations (Including Noncontrolling Interests)4,281 3,956 2,622 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— 5 4 Net Income (Including Noncontrolling Interests)4,281 3,961 2,626 Less: noncontrolling interests from continuing operations(134)(135)(125)Net Income – Linde plc$4,147 $3,826 $2,501 Net Income – Linde plcIncome from continuing operations$4,147 $3,821 $2,497 Income from discontinued operations$— $5 $4 Per Share Data – Linde plc ShareholdersBasic earnings per share from continuing operations$8.30 $7.39 $4.74 Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations— 0.01 0.01 Basic earnings per share$8.30 $7.40 $4.75 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations$8.23 $7.32 $4.70 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations— 0.01 0.01 Diluted earnings per share$8.23 $7.33 $4.71 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding (000’s):Basic shares outstanding499,736 516,896 526,736 Diluted shares outstanding504,038 521,875 531,157 The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.50Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMELINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES(Dollar amounts in millions) Year Ended December 31,202220212020 NET INCOME (INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS)$4,281 $3,961 $2,626 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Translation adjustments:Foreign currency translation adjustments(1,725)(1,116)565 Reclassifications to net income(110)(52)— Income taxes— (7)30 Translation adjustments(1,835)(1,175)595 Funded status -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESLinde plc (""Linde"" or ""the company"") is an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland. Linde’s registered office is located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland. Linde’s principal executive offices are located at Forge, 43 Church Street West, Woking, Surrey GU21 6HT, United Kingdom and 10 Riverview Drive, Danbury, Connecticut, United States 06810. Linde trades on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol LIN.On January 18, 2023, shareholders approved the company’s proposal for an intercompany reorganization that will result in the delisting of its ordinary shares from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Following the completion of legal and regulatory approvals, Linde anticipates that the intercompany reorganization and delisting process will be completed, and its ordinary shares will be delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, on or about March 1, 2023.In connection with the closing of the intercompany reorganization, Linde shareholders will automatically receive one share of the new holding company, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in exchange for each share of Linde plc they own. The new holding company will also be named “Linde plc” and will trade under the existing ticker LIN.Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("" U.S. GAAP"") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.Operations – Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde’s Engineering business offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including supplying plant components and services directly to customers.Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 19 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies. Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment – Net – Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes labor, applicable overhead and interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are also capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which 55Table of Contentsrange from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 8). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.The company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value may be required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.Asset-Retirement Obligations – An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company’s asset-retirement obligations are primarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation – For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 7). Financial Instruments – Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Provided the hedge remains highly effective, any ineffectiveness is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.See Note 12 for additional information relating to financial instruments.Goodwill – Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.56Table of ContentsThe company performs a goodwill impairment test annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. The qualitative analysis of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022 showed the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value, as such further analysis was not performed. See Note 9 for additional information relating to goodwill.Other Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred. See Note 10 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.Income Taxes – Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.Under the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. See Note 5 for additional information relating to income taxes.Retirement Benefits – Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees’ expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices. See Note 16 for additional information relating to retirement programs.Share-based Compensation– The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. See Note 15 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.Reclassifications – Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Implemented in 2022 There were no new accounting pronouncements that would materially impact the 2022 financial statements.57Table of ContentsNOTE 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures AcquisitionsAcquisitions were $110 million, $88 million and $68 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Acquisitions in 2022 and 2021 primarily related to the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions in 2020 primarily related to the Americas.DivestituresSale of GIST businessIn the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its GIST business. Proceeds from the sale were $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $21 million (benefit of $3 million, after tax), recorded within the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 3).Deconsolidation of Joint Venture in APACEffective January 1, 2021, Linde deconsolidated a joint venture with operations in APAC, due to the expiration of certain contractual rights that the parties mutually agreed not to renew. From the effective date, the joint venture is reflected as an equity investment on Linde's consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding results reflected in income from equity investments on the consolidated statement of income.The fair value of the joint venture at January 1, 2021 was determined using a discounted cash flow model and approximated the carrying amount of its net assets. The net carrying value of $852 million was mainly comprised of assets of approximately $1.9 billion (primarily Other intangibles and Property plant and equipment - net), net of liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion. Upon deconsolidation an equity investment was recorded representing Linde's share of the joint venture's net assets. The deconsolidation resulted in a gain of $52 million recorded within 2021 charges (see Note 3) related to the release of the CTA balance recorded within AOCI. The company did not receive any consideration, cash or otherwise, as part of the deconsolidation.The joint venture contributed sales of approximately $600 million in 2020. 58Table of ContentsNOTE 3. Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Other Charges2022 ChargesRussia-Ukraine conflict and other charges were $1 billion ($896 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the year ended December 31, 2022, largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia-Ukraine ConflictIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., have imposed several tranches of economic sanctions on Russia. As a result, Linde reassessed its ability to control its Russian subsidiaries and determined that as of June 30, 2022 it can no longer exercise control over these entities. As such, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax) during the second quarter. The fair value of Linde’s Russian subsidiaries was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, which resulted in the recognition of a $407 million loss on deconsolidation when compared to the carrying value of the entities. This loss is recorded within Russia-Ukraine conflict and other charges in the consolidated statements of income.Upon deconsolidation an investment was recorded, which represents the fair value of net assets. The company did not receive any consideration, cash or otherwise, as part of the deconsolidation. Linde will maintain its interest in its Russian subsidiaries and will continue to comply with sanctions and government restrictions as it continues to develop divestiture options. The investment will be monitored for impairment in future periods.Receivables, primarily loans receivable, with newly deconsolidated entities were reassessed for collectability resulting in a write-off of approximately $380 million.Other Russia related chargesOther charges related specifically to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were $103 million ($73 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are primarily comprised of impairments of assets which are maintained by international entities in support of the Russian business.Merger-Related Costs and Other ChargesMerger-related costs and other charges were $139 million ($93 million, after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to severance actions within the Engineering segment recorded during the fourth quarter, the impairment of an equity method investment in the EMEA segment, and the sale of the GIST business completed on September 30, 2022 (see Note 2).The following table provides a summary of the pre-tax charges by reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 :Year Ended December 31, 2022(millions of dollars)Russia deconsolidation chargesOther Russia related chargesTotal Russia chargesMerger-related costs and other chargesTotalAmericas$— $— $— $4 $4 EMEA733 (7)726 25 751 APAC— — — 28 28 Engineering54 110 164 41 205 Other— — — 41 41 Total$787 $103 $890 $139 $1,029 2021 Charges Cost reduction programs and other charges were $273 million ($279 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2021. 59Table of ContentsTotal cost reduction program related charges were $338 million ($253 million after tax), for the year ended December 31, 2021. These expenses consisted primarily of severance charges of $259 million and other charges of $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other charges related primarily to the execution of the company's synergistic actions including location consolidations and business rationalization projects, process harmonization, and associated non-recurring costs. Merger-related and other charges were benefits of $65 million (benefit of $26 million, after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 pre-tax benefit was primarily due to a $52 million gain triggered by a joint venture deconsolidation in the APAC segment.Year Ended December 31, 2021(millions of dollars)Severance costsOther cost reduction chargesTotal cost reduction program related chargesMerger related and other chargesTotalAmericas$4 $2 $6 $(6)$— EMEA204 33 237 1 238 APAC16 12 28 (50)(22)Engineering20 6 26 — 26 Other15 26 41 (10)31 Total$259 $79 $338 $(65)$273 2020 Charges Cost reduction programs and other charges were $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, ($372 million after tax).

In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded as other current or long-term liabilities (see Note 7). On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 18 Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.61Table of ContentsNOTE 4. LEASESIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Linde determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Total lease and rental expenses related to operating lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $284 million and $317 million, respectively. Operating leases costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Total lease and rental expenses related to finance lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $57 million and $51 million, respectively, and the costs are included in depreciation and amortization and interest. Related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Linde includes renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Operating and financing lease expenses above include short term and variable lease costs which are immaterial.As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, Linde uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Linde determines incremental borrowing rates through market sources. The company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases that meet the short-term lease definition are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance. The company does not have material variable lease payments.Gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial. Operating cash flows used for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $254 million and $290 million, respectively. Cash flows used for finance leases for the same period were immaterial.

After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2022, the company had $289 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $276 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $215 million relating to NOLs of which $90 million expire within 5 years, $42 million expire after 5 years and $83 million have no expiration. The 65Table of Contentsdeferred tax assets also include $74 million related to credits of which $5 million expire within 5 years, $66 million expire after 5 years, and $3 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $276 million primarily relate to NOLs and foreign currency loss related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities associated with future repatriations. Management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the benefit of these losses will be realized. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.The company has $545 million of non-U.S. income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2022. A provision has not been made for any additional non-U.S. income tax at December 31, 2022 on approximately $33 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $33 billion could become subject to additional non-U.S. income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary, or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.Uncertain Tax PositionsUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $325 million, $387 million and $452 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (Millions of dollars)202220212020Unrecognized income tax benefits, January 1$387 $452 $472 Additions for tax positions of prior years 26 11 35 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (a)(45)(11)(34)Additions for current year tax positions— 19 11 Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (a)(b)(23)(60)(39)Foreign currency translation and other(20)(24)7 Unrecognized income tax benefits, December 31$325 $387 $452 ________________________(a)2022 amounts are primarily related to the settlement of tax audits. (b)Settlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty. The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest benefit of $3 million and $15 million and expense of $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company had $35 million and $40 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 7). 66Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2022, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below: Major tax jurisdictionsOpen YearsNorth and South AmericaUnited States2017 through 2022Canada2014 through 2022Mexico2014 through 2022Brazil2003 through 2022Europe and AfricaFrance2019 through 2022Germany2018 through 2022Spain2010 through 2022United Kingdom2020 through 2022Asia and AustraliaAustralia2018 through 2022China2017 through 2022India2006 through 2022South Korea2020 through 2022The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.67Table of ContentsNOTE 6.

These expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default rates for each business, taking regional circumstances into account. If necessary, these historical default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. The loss rates are also evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability of the receivables. Gross trade receivables aged less than one year were $4,498 million and $4,425 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and gross receivables aged greater than one year were $321 million and $329 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Gross other receivables were $145 million and $150 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Receivables aged greater than one year are generally fully reserved unless specific circumstances warrant exceptions, such as those backed by federal governments.Provisions for expected credit losses were $163 million, $129 million and $182 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

For the fourth quarter 2022 test, the company applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded. There were no indicators of impairment since the annual goodwill impairment test was performed through December 31, 2022. 72NOTE 10.

The Five Year Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on December 7, 2027 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In addition, on December 7, 2022, the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured 364-day revolving credit agreement (the “364-Day Credit Agreement” and, together with the Five Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) with a syndicate of banking institutions. The 364-Day Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $1.5 billion. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on December 7, 2023 with the option to elect to have the entire principal balance outstanding under the Credit Agreement converted into non-revolving term loans, which will be due and payable one year after the commitment termination date. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreements as of December 31, 2022.Other Debt InformationThe weighted-average interest rates of short-term borrowings outstanding were 3.2% and 0.0% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expected maturities of long-term debt are as follows:(Millions of dollars) 2023$1,599 20241,219 20251,548 20261,686 20271,442 Thereafter6,303 $13,797 As of December 31, 2022, the amount of Linde's assets pledged as collateral was immaterial.See Note 13 for the fair value information related to debt.76Table of ContentsNOTE 12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy and commodity costs. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, through the use of a qualitative assessment, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Counterparties to Linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes (""CSAs"") in place for certain entities with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2022, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for consolidated subsidiaries: Fair Value(Millions of dollars)Notional AmountsAssets (a)Liabilities (a)December 31,202220212022202120222021Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $3,056 $4,427 $13 $22 $7 $17 Forecasted transactions449 537 9 6 9 11 Cross-currency swaps42 148 — 21 1 4 Commodity contracts N/AN/A— — — — Total$3,547 $5,112 $22 $49 $17 $32 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:Currency contracts:Balance sheet items $— $— $— $— $— $— Forecasted transactions323 758 6 14 5 3 Commodity contractsN/AN/A— 49 4 — Interest rate swaps 856 1,251 — 24 70 — Total Hedges$1,179 $2,009 $6 $87 $79 $3 Total Derivatives$4,726 $7,121 $28 $136 $96 $35 77Table of Contents (a) Amounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 included current assets of $24 million and $101 million, which are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $4 million and $35 million, which are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $23 million and $27 million, which are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $73 million and $8 million, which are recorded in other long-term liabilities. Balance Sheet ItemsForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.Forecasted TransactionsForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Cross-Currency SwapsCross-currency interest rate swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond. Commodity Contracts Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. Net Investment HedgesAs of December 31, 2022, Linde has €8.0 billion ($8.5 billion) Euro-denominated notes and intercompany loans and ¥3.2 billion ($0.5 billion) CNY-denominated intercompany loans that are designated as hedges of the net investment positions in certain foreign operations. Since hedge inception, the deferred gain recorded within cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is $473 million (deferred gain of $333 million for the year ended December 31, 2022).As of December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements relating to previously designated hedges that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is a loss of $42 million. These movements will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the related foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. Interest Rate SwapsLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability (See Note 11). Derivatives Impact on Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following table summarizes the impact of the company's derivatives on the consolidated statements of income:78Table of Contents(Millions of dollars) Amount of Pre-Tax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings *December 31,202220212020Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging InstrumentsCurrency contracts:Balance sheet items:Debt-related$12 $42 $(125)Other balance sheet items8 (5)(40)Total$20 $38 $(165)* The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net.The amounts of gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. Net impacts expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021: Fair Value Measurements Using(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3 202220212022202120222021AssetsDerivative assets$— $— $28 $136 $— $— Investments and securities *20 42 — — 13 20 Total$20 $42 $28 $136 $13 $20 LiabilitiesDerivative liabilities$— $— $96 $35 $— $— *Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.Changes in level 3 investments and securities were immaterial.The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. 79Table of ContentsThe fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $11,994 million versus a carrying value of $13,797 million. At December 31, 2021 the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,219 million versus a carrying value of $13,044 million. Differences between the carrying value and the fair value are attributable to fluctuations in interest rates subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.80Table of ContentsNOTE 14. EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTSLinde plc Shareholders’ EquityAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, Linde has total authorized share capital of €1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each, 25,000 A ordinary shares of €1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of €0.001 each.At December 31, 2022 there were 552,012,862 and 492,457,627 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2022 there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.At December 31, 2021 there were 552,012,862 and 508,680,879 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding. Linde’s Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.Other Linde plc Ordinary Share and Treasury Share TransactionsLinde may issue new ordinary shares for dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans and employee savings and incentive plans. No new ordinary shares were issued in 2022, 2021 and 2020.On January 22, 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 24,847,354 shares through December 31, 2021. Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2021.On January 25, 2021 the company's board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $5.0 billion of its ordinary shares (""2021 program"") under which Linde had repurchased 16,662,678 shares through December 31, 2022. This program is set to expire on July 31, 2023. Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2022.On February 28, 2022, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $10.0 billion of its ordinary shares (""2022 program"") under which Linde had repurchased 15,474,759 shares through December 31, 2022. This program expires on July 31, 2024.Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. 2022 includes the impact of deconsolidating the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities (see to Note 3). The decrease during 2021 is primarily related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see to Note 2). The decrease during 2020 primarily relates to the initiated buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa. As of December 31, 2020, the conditions of the buyout were met obligating the company to execute in January 2021. Therefore, the company reclassified $196 million from non-controlling interest to other current liabilities reflecting the transaction price. An additional $35 million of dividends declared to the minority owners, reflected on the Dividends and other capital reductions line, was also reclassified to other current liabilities at December 31, 2020 and was paid in 2021.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company’s control (“redeemable noncontrolling interests”) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes an industrial gas business in EMEA where the noncontrolling shareholders have put options. 81Table of ContentsNOTE 15. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense was $107 million in 2022 ($128 million and $133 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $64 million in 2022 ($64 million and $79 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.Summary of Plans The 2021 Linde plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan"") was adopted by the Board of Directors and shareholders of Linde plc on July 26, 2021. Upon adoption of the 2021 Plan, any authorized shares that remained available for grant for new awards under the Amended and Restated 2009 Linde Long Term Incentive Plan (the ""2009 Plan"") were cancelled. The 2021 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, 8,271,252 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2021 Plan, of which 2,726,282 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.Exercise prices for options granted under the 2021 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2021 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. In order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares. Stock Option Fair ValueThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2022 was $45.07 ($37.80 in 2021 and $17.37 in 2020) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in the grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to the increase in the stock price. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2022, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31,202220212020Dividend yield1.7 %1.7 %2.2 %Volatility20.6 %18.4 %15.8 %Risk-free interest rate1.70 %1.10 %0.60 %Expected term years566The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2022 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): 82Table of ContentsActivityNumber ofOptions(000’s)AverageExercisePriceAverageRemainingLifeAggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding at January 1, 20227,166 $152.56 Granted476 270.99 Exercised(880)125.03 Cancelled or expired(42)239.21 Outstanding at December 31, 20226,720 $164.03 5.0$1,090 Exercisable at December 31, 20225,383 $145.71 5.0$971 The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $326.18 as of December 31, 2022 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2022 was $176 million ($294 million and $264 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively).Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2022 was $36 million ($50 million and $36 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $61 million for 2022 ($64 million and $70 million cash tax benefit in 2021 and 2020, respectively). As of December 31, 2022, $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.Performance-Based and Restricted Stock Unit AwardsIn 2022, the company granted 368,600 performance-based stock unit awards under the 2021 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital (""ROC"") performance or relative total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance versus that of the S&P 500 (weighted 67%) and Eurofirst 300 (weighted 33%). The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The number of performance-based stock unit awards granted in 2022 includes an increase of 226,690 stock units to the target number of performance-based awards originally granted in 2019, as these awards achieved a higher payout factor upon completion of the three-year performance period.The weighted-average fair value of ROC awards granted in 2022 was $257.63 ($241.10 in 2021 and $161.56 in 2020). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value of TSR awards granted in 2022 was $301.42 ($301.04 in 2021 and $198.61 in 2020) and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. There were 139,512 restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2022. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2022 was $260.27 ($242.60 in 2021 and $174.95 in 2020). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.The following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock unit award activity as of December 31, 2022 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): 83Table of Contents Performance-BasedRestricted StockNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNumber ofShares(000’s)AverageGrant DateFair ValueNon-vested at January 1, 2022610 $204.39 636 $172.90 Granted 369 275.31 140 260.27 Vested(383)184.32 (113)168.33 Cancelled and Forfeited(13)250.01 (17)232.51 Non-vested at December 31, 2022583 $226.04 646 $190.33 There are approximately 12 thousand performance-based stock units and 18 thousand restricted stock units that are non-vested at December 31, 2022 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current share price.As of December 31, 2022, $42 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards and $32 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock unit awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2025.NOTE 16. RETIREMENT PROGRAMSDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.The Linde retirement plans are non-contributory defined benefit plans covering eligible employees and its participating affiliates. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between a traditional benefit (the “Traditional Design”) and an account-based benefit (the “Account-Based Design”). The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant’s career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde’s non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.Linde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. Multi-employer Pension PlansIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (""MEPs""), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2026. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2021 and 2020. Total 2022 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.84Table of ContentsLinde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (""PPA"") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. As of December 31, 2022, there were three Red Zone plans, deemed to be in ""critical"" or ""critical and declining"" status that have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans and such obligation would be immaterial. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.Defined Contribution PlansLinde’s U.S. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution savings plans offered by their applicable business. Employee contribution percentages vary by plan and are subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations.The cost for these defined contribution plans was $56 million in 2022, $51 million in 2021 and $46 million in 2020 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow).The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (""ESOP"") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 1,733,281 at December 31, 2022.Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $80 million in 2022, $101 million in 2021 and $106 million in 2020 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow). Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Pension and Postretirement Benefit CostsThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (""OPEB"") costs for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are shown in the table below: (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,202220212020Amount recognized in Operating Profit Service cost$127 $157 $152 Amount recognized in Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost Interest cost201 154 213 Expected return on plan assets(518)(521)(482) Net amortization and deferral74 171 86 Settlement charges (a)6 4 6 $(237)$(192)$(177)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(110)$(35)$(25)(a) Settlement charges were triggered by lump sum benefit payments made from a U.S. non-qualified plan.Funded StatusChanges in the benefit obligation and plan assets for Linde’s pension and OPEB programs, including reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are shown below. 85Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,20222021U.S.Non-U.S. U.S.Non-U.S.Change in Benefit Obligation (""PBO"")Benefit obligation, January 1$2,719 $9,398 $2,895 $10,010 Service cost34 93 39 118 Interest cost60 141 48 106 Divestitures — — — (13)Participant contributions11 17 11 19 Plan amendment— — — — Actuarial loss (gain)(528)(2,972)(101)(210)Benefits paid(158)(296)(166)(333)Plan settlement(9)(8)(7)(13)Foreign currency translation and other changes— (787)— (286)Benefit obligation, December 31$2,129 $5,586 $2,719 $9,398 Accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"")$1,982 $5,508 $2,503 $9,278 Change in Plan AssetsFair value of plan assets, January 1$2,448 $7,968 $2,310 $7,653 Actual return on plan assets(421)(1,302)281 728 Company contributions— 51 — 42 Participant contributions— 17 — 19 Benefits paid from plan assets(136)(248)(143)(272)Divestitures — — — (14)Foreign currency translation and other changes— (692)— (188)Fair value of plan assets, December 31$1,891 $5,794 $2,448 $7,968 Funded Status, End of Year$(238)$208 $(271)$(1,430)Recorded in the Balance Sheet (Note 7)Other long-term assets$13 $648 $15 $124 Other current liabilities(38)(13)(25)(13)Other long-term liabilities(213)(427)(261)(1,541)Net amount recognized, December 31$(238)$208 $(271)$(1,430)Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of:Net actuarial loss (gain)$357 $(343)$364 $1,078 Prior service cost (credit)(12)4 (13)6 Deferred tax obligation (benefit) (Note 7)(85)139 (88)(217)Amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (Note 7)$260 $(200)$263 $867 86Table of ContentsComparative funded status information as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for select non-U.S. pension plans is presented in the table below as the benefit obligations of these plans are considered to be significant relative to the total benefit obligation: United KingdomGermanyOther Non-U.S.Total Non-U.S.(Millions of dollars)2022202220222022Benefit obligation, December 31$3,100 $1,485 $1,001 $5,586 Fair value of plan assets, December 313,625 1,285 884 5,794 Funded Status, End of Year$525 $(200)$(117)$208 United KingdomGermanyOther Non-U.S.Total Non-U.S.(Millions of dollars)2021202120212021Benefit obligation, December 31$5,879 $2,240 $1,279 $9,398 Fair value of plan assets, December 315,577 1,359 1,032 7,968 Funded Status, End of Year$(302)$(881)$(247)$(1,430)The changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income in 2022 and 2021 are as follows: Pensions(Millions of dollars)20222021Current year net actuarial losses (gains)*$(1,259)$(787)Amortization of net actuarial gains (losses)(75)(170)Amortization of prior service credits (costs)1 (1)Pension settlements(6)(4)Foreign currency translation and other changes(90)(39)Total recognized in other comprehensive income$(1,429)$(1,001)________________________ * Pension net actuarial gains in 2022 are largely driven by the continued increase in the discount rate environment resulting in actuarial gains from a lower PBO, which is partially offset by unfavorable plan asset experience for both non-U.S. and U.S. plans. In 2021, the actuarial gains were attributable to an increase in actual return on assets and favorability generated from a lower PBO due the initial increase in discount rates.

For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.00% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 50%-70% equity securities (approximately 7.70% expected return), 20%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.40% expected return) and 2%-8% alternative investments (approximately 6.30% expected return). For the non-U.S. plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.40% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.30% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.00% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 7.00%. For the non-U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 5.10%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as a factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. For 2023, the expected weighted average long-term rate of return for non-U.S. plans will be 5.60%.Pension Plan AssetsThe investments of the U.S. pension plan are managed to meet the future expected benefit liabilities of the plan over the long term by investing in diversified portfolios consistent with prudent diversification and historical and expected capital market returns. Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The non-U.S. pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for Linde’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, as well as respective asset allocation ranges by major asset category, are generally as follows: 88Table of Contents U.S.Non-U.S.Asset CategoryTarget 2022Target 202120222021Target 2022Target 202120222021Equity securities50%-70%40%-60%60 %66 %15%-25%15%-25%20 %27 %Fixed income securities20%-50%30%-50%29 %25 %30%-50%30%-50%30 %35 %Other2%-8%5%-15%11 %9 %30%-50%30%-50%50 %38 %The following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Equity Securities – This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and non-U.S. companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or non-U.S. exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual Funds – These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. Emerging Market Debt - This category includes fixed income debt issued by countries with developing economies as well as by corporations within those nations. They typically have higher yields but lower credit ratings relative to developed country corporate and government bonds. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.U.S. and Non-U.S. Government Bonds – This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and non-U.S. government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Corporate Bonds – This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Pooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities. Bank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Liquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using 90Table of Contentsobservable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Insurance Contracts – This category is comprised of purchased annuity insurance contracts (annuity contract buy-ins) and is intended to mitigate the Company's exposure to certain risks, such as longevity risk. The fair value is calculated based on the cash surrender value of the purchased annuity insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Real Estate Funds – This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Private Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. ContributionsAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $51 million in 2022, $42 million in 2021 and $91 million in 2020. Estimated required contributions for 2023 are currently expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company’s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).Contingent LiabilitiesLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate individually or in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.Significant matters are:•During 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During 2009, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.•At December 31, 2022 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company that previously received favorable rulings. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $240 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. On February 8, 2023, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a decision confirming the constitutionality of a specific federal income tax, with retroactive effect. This decision has not yet been finalized and is subject to ongoing motions for clarification. The timing of when this decision will be final and the potential impact on the company’s tax liability remain uncertain at this time.•On September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$2.2 billion Brazilian reais ($417 million) on White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde Inc. The fine was reduced to R$1.7 billion Brazilian reais ($322 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against White Martins was overturned by the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE has filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice and a decision is pending.Similarly, on September 1, 2010, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$237 million Brazilian reais ($45 million) on Linde Gases Ltda., the former Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde AG, which was divested to MG Industries GmbH on March 1, 2019 and with respect to which Linde provided a contractual indemnity. The fine was reduced to R$188 million Brazilian reais ($36 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. The fine against Linde Gases Ltda. was overturned by the Seventh Federal Court in Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision, and the Federal Court of Appeals rejected CADE's appeal and confirmed the decision of the Seventh 92Table of ContentsFederal Court of Brasilia. CADE filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice, and a final decision is pending.Linde has strong defenses and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fines overturned. Linde strongly believes that the allegations of anticompetitive activity against our current and former Brazilian subsidiaries are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence. Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserves have been recorded as management does not believe that a loss from this case is probable. •On and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (Landgericht) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG’s minority shareholders for €189.46 per share. Any such increase would apply to all 14,763,113 Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims lack merit, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.•On December 30, 2022, the Russian Arbitration Court of the St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region issued an injunction preventing (i) the sale of any shares in Linde’s subsidiaries and joint ventures in Russia, and (ii) the disposal of any of assets in those entities exceeding 5% of the relevant company’s overall asset value. The injunction is not expected to have any impact on the operations of Linde’s Russian businesses. The injunction was requested by RusChemAlliance (RCA) as a preliminary measure to secure payment of an eventual award under an arbitration proceeding RCA intends to file against Linde Engineering for alleged breach of contract under the agreement to build a gas processing plant in Ust Luga, Russia entered into between a consortium of Linde Engineering and Renaissance Heavy Industries LLC, and RCA on July 7, 2021. Performance of the agreement was lawfully suspended by Linde Engineering on May 27, 2022 in compliance with applicable sanctions and in accordance with a decision by the sanctions authority in Germany. As of December 31, 2022, Linde had approximately $1.2 billion of advance payments recorded in contract liabilities related to engineering projects with RCA which are subject to sanctions and have been suspended accordingly as of May 27, 2022. Contract liabilities are typically recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022 (see Note 3), and the remaining investment value of its Russia subsidiaries is immaterial. As such, the obligation to satisfy any residual contract liabilities is not expected to have an adverse impact on earnings, but may result in net cash outflows. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of this matter. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in both the injunction and arbitration proceedings.CommitmentsAt December 31, 2022, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $3,578 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including non-U.S. litigation matters.Other commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 4, 5, 11, and 16).NOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATIONLinde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment, which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. 93Table of ContentsThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. Similarly, total assets have not been included as this is not provided to the CODM for their assessment. The table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.Contracts with CustomersLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.Industrial GasesWithin each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.Following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies: On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.96Table of ContentsThe company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. Engineering The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Changes to cost estimates and contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustments for the inception-to-date effect of such change.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $124 million at December 31, 2022 and $134 million at December 31, 2021. Total contract liabilities are $3,986 million at December 31, 2022 (current of $3,073 million and $913 million within deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheets). As of December 31, 2022 Linde has approximately $1.7 billion recorded in contract liabilities related to engineering projects in Russia subject to sanctions. Total contract liabilities were $3,699 million at December 31, 2021 (current contract liabilities of $2,940 million and $759 million within deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2021 was $1,305 million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business.Payment Terms and OtherLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.Disaggregated Revenue InformationAs described above and in Note 18, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing.The following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.97Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2022SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$3,786 $2,509 $2,220 $— $176 $8,691 26 %On-Site4,048 2,415 2,471 — — 8,934 27 %Packaged Gas5,831 3,466 1,523 — 51 10,871 33 %Other209 53 266 2,762 1,578 4,868 14 %$13,874 $8,443 $6,480 $2,762 $1,805 $33,364 100 %(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2021SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$3,279 $2,227 $2,181 $— $173 $7,860 26 %On-Site3,225 1,824 2,296 — — 7,345 24 %Packaged Gas5,456 3,539 1,532 — 24 10,551 34 %Other143 53 124 2,867 1,850 5,037 16 %$12,103 $7,643 $6,133 $2,867 $2,047 $30,793 100 %(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2020SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal%Merchant$2,839 $1,870 $2,005 $— $145 $6,859 25 %On-Site2,513 1,354 2,049 — — 5,916 22 %Packaged Gas5,034 3,175 1,559 — 22 9,790 36 %Other73 50 74 2,851 1,630 4,678 17 %$10,459 $6,449 $5,687 $2,851 $1,797 $27,243 100 %Remaining Performance ObligationsAs described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. Additionally, plant sales from the Linde Engineering business are primarily contracted on a fixed price basis. The company estimates the consideration related to future minimum purchase requirements and plant sales was approximately $51 billion (excludes Russian projects which are impacted by sanctions, refer to Note 3). This amount excludes all on-site sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next five years and the remaining thereafter.20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn January 6, 2023, Linde purchased the remaining 77.2% ownership interest in nexAir, LLC. nexAir, LLC is one of the largest independent packaged gas distributors in the United States with annual sales of approximately $400 million in 2022.98Table of ContentsITEM 9.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe information set forth below is a summary that should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of Linde plc and the related notes thereto, included in Item 8 to this Form 10-K.To date, Linde plc has not conducted any material activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the business combination agreement. Linde plc does not have any material assets and the management of Linde plc has not resolved to make any future investments other than in relation to the business combination. In connection with the proposed business combination, Linde plc filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 which was declared effective by the SEC on August 14, 2017. On July 24, 2017 Linde plc entered into a cash management agreement with Praxair International Finance UC to finance the Company´s working capital obligations. The total available amount under the facility is €30,000,000. The cash management agreement is Euro denominated and has a variable interest rate of one month EUR LIBOR plus a 0% spread. The cash management agreement terminates on the earlier of the termination date of the business combination agreement or the business day immediately following the closing date of the business combination. As of December 31, 2017, $9,501,470 was outstanding under this facility primarily related to SEC registration fees paid by Praxair International Finance UC on behalf of Linde plc.In addition, Linde plc has incurred expenses of $1,882,646 for the period from inception to December 31, 2017, primarily related to accounting and advisory services incurred in connection with the business combination. As of December 31, 2017, Linde plc did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Linde plc did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities.Forward-looking StatementsCertain statements and assumptions in this document contain or are based on “forward-looking” information. Forward-looking statements are based on Linde plc’s beliefs and assumptions on the basis of factors currently known to them. These forward-looking statements include terms and phrases such as: “anticipate,” “expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding benefits of the proposed business combination, integration plans and expected synergies and cost reductions, anticipated future growth, financial and operating performance and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results predicted or expected. No assurance can be given that these forward-looking statements will prove accurate and correct, or that projected or anticipated future results will be achieved. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to Linde plc on the date hereof, and Linde plc disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than Linde plc has described. All such factors are difficult to predict and beyond Linde plc’s control. These factors include: •failure to obtain applicable governmental or regulatory approvals in a timely manner or otherwise, or being required to accept conditions, including divestitures, that could reduce the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination as a condition to obtaining regulatory approvals; •the ability to implement the business combination and to satisfy applicable closing conditions; •the ability to integrate the operations of Praxair and Linde, the ultimate outcome of Linde plc’s commercial and operating strategy following completion of the business combination, including the ultimate ability to realize synergies and cost reductions; •operating costs, customer loss or business disruption being greater than expected in anticipation of, or, if consummated, following, the business combination; 18Table of Contents•the effects of a combination of Praxair and Linde, including Linde plc’s future financial position, operating results, strategy and plans; •Linde plc’s ability to maintain effective internal controls; •unanticipated litigation, claims or assessments, as well as the outcome/impact of any current/pending litigation, claims or assessments, including in connection with a potential post-completion reorganization with respect to Linde AG; •potential security violations to Linde plc's information technology systems; •the investment performance of Praxair’s and/or Linde’s pension plan assets, which could require Praxair and/or Linde to increase their pension contributions; •changes in legislation or governmental regulations affecting Linde plc; international, national or local economic, social or political conditions or other factors such as currency exchange rates, inflation rates, recessionary or expansive trends, taxes and regulations and laws that could adversely affect Linde plc, Praxair and Linde or their clients; and •other factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in the section ""Risk Factors"" included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskDuring the period covered by this report, Linde plc did not conduct any material activities and therefore did not incur any significant interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk or other relevant market risks. 19Table of ContentsItem 8.

Quarterly Data (Unaudited)3120Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and shareholders of Linde plc:Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and April 18, 2017, and the related consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and April 18, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Organization and Basis of Presentation Linde plc, formerly known as Zamalight plc (""Linde plc"" or the “Company”), was incorporated as a public limited company under the laws of Ireland on April 18, 2017, by Enceladus Holding Limited (""Enceladus"") and Cumberland Corporate Services Limited (""Cumberland""), with an issued share capital of €25,000 ($26,827), comprised of 25,000 A ordinary shares with a nominal value of €1.00 each, and additional paid in capital of €25,000 ($26,827). The A ordinary shares of €1.00 each were initially issued on Linde plc’s incorporation as ordinary shares. These shares were subsequently re-designated as A ordinary shares on July 25, 2017. Zamalight plc was renamed ""Linde plc"" on July 20, 2017.The Company is registered in Ireland under the registration number 602527 and with its registered office located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland and principal executive offices at The Priestley Centre, 10 Priestley Road, The Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XY, United Kingdom. The Company was formed on April 18, 2017; accordingly, the financial statements as of that date only comprise the balance sheet (“opening balance sheet”). The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31, 2017.The Company was formed in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated as of June 1, 2017, as amended (the ""business combination agreement""), pursuant to which, among other things, Praxair, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Praxair”) and Linde AG, a German stock corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Linde”) agreed to combine their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of the Company. In connection with the proposed business combination, Linde plc filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the ""registration statement"") which was declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on August 14, 2017. Linde plc has also filed an offer document with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt fuer Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”) which was approved for publication by BaFin on August 14, 2017 and published by Linde plc on August 15, 2017 (the ""offer document""). Pursuant to the offer document, Linde plc made an offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of Linde AG for 1.540 ordinary shares of Linde plc (the “exchange offer”). In addition, Zamalight Subco, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of Linde plc, will merge with and into Praxair, Inc., with Praxair, Inc. surviving the merger (the “merger”, and together with the exchange offer, the “business combination” ). In the merger, each share of Praxair, Inc. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one Linde plc ordinary share. Praxair, Inc.’s stockholders approved the merger at Praxair, Inc.’s special meeting held on September 27, 2017 and on November 24, 2017, the tender period for the exchange offer expired with approximately 92% of all Linde AG shares entitled to voting rights being tendered. The parties currently expect the business combination to be completed in the second half of 2018. Upon completion of the business combination, Linde plc will apply to list its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and will seek inclusion in the S&P 500 and DAX 30 indices.Completion of the business combination remains subject to approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities, including approvals under applicable competition laws.The business combination agreement, or certain covenants contained therein, may be terminated for, or may terminate as a result of, certain reasons, including, among others, (a) the mutual consent of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG to termination, (b) a permanent injunction or order by any governmental entity in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany or the United States that prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the Business Combination, (c) the occurrence of a change, event, occurrence or effect that has had or is reasonably expected to have a “material adverse change” (as defined in the business combination agreement) on Linde AG or Praxair, Inc. or (d) the failure to obtain approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities described in the preceding paragraph. To date, the Company has not conducted any material activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the business combination agreement such as the incurrence of SEC registration fees and other transaction-related costs (see Note 3 - Subsidiaries). For additional information related to the business combination agreement, please refer to the registration statement.To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient funds available to satisfy its obligations, Praxair, Inc. will finance any out of pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement. If the Business Combination is not completed, any expenses incurred by the Company and/or its affiliates will be shared equally by Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law and as otherwise provided in the business combination agreement.26Table of ContentsThese financial statements have been prepared in compliance with US GAAP. The following new accounting standards in the United States issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) have not yet been implemented by the Company. The Company will evaluate, when applicable, the impacts of adopting the below standards on future periods:•Revenue Recognition - In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the reporting and disclosure of revenue. The new guidance requires the evaluation of contracts with customers to determine the recognition of revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation, and requires expanded disclosures. Subsequently, the FASB has issued amendments to certain aspects of the guidance including the effective date. This guidance is required to be effective beginning in the first quarter 2018 and includes several transition options.•Leases - In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting and financial statement presentation of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, except those that meet certain scope exceptions, and would require expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2019 and requires companies to transition using a modified retrospective approach.•Credit Losses on Financial Instruments - In June 2016, the FASB issued an update on the measurement of credit losses. The guidance introduces a new accounting model for expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on estimates of current expected credit losses. This guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter 2019 and requires companies to apply the change in accounting on a prospective basis. •Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The update provides accounting guidance for specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. This new guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2018 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption optional. •Intra-Entity Asset Transfers - In October 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for income tax accounting of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The update requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory in the period when the transfer occurs. This new guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2018, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis.•Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment - In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2020 with early adoption permitted.•Pension Costs - In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires the service cost component be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and not included within operating profit. This guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2018, with early adoption optional, and requires companies to transition using a retrospective approach for the presentation of the service cost component and the other cost components and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component. •Derivatives and Hedging - In August 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for hedging activities. The new guidance changes both the designation and measurement for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2019, with early adoption optional. •Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income – In February 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This new guidance will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2019 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption optional. 27Table of Contents2. Accounting PoliciesBasis of PreparationThe financial statements present the consolidated results and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period from incorporation being April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Going ConcernThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, taking account of the facilities available under the cash management agreement (see Note 7). CurrencyItems included in these consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial information is presented in U.S. Dollars (""USD""). The US Dollar/Euro exchange rate at April 18, 2017 was 0.9319 and at December 31, 2017 was 0.8330.Consolidation and SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Company and its group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the group.Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks or other highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Other ReceivablesOther receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Other receivables are stated at the lower of amortized cost or recoverable amount. If collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. Other ProvisionsThe Company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s balance sheet or liquidity.Share CapitalAccording to article 3 of Linde plc's Articles of Association, the authorized share capital of the Company is €1,775,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each and 25,000 A ordinary shares of €1.00 each. As of the opening balance sheet date and as of December 31, 2017, 25,000 A ordinary shares had been issued and 12,500 shares were held by Enceladus which is wholly owned by Praxair, Inc.’s Irish legal counsel Arthur Cox, and 12,500 shares were held by Cumberland which is wholly owned by Linde AG´s Irish legal counsel William Fry, the Company’s shareholders. Furthermore, an additional €25,000 ($26,827) was committed to be paid by the two shareholders. 28Table of ContentsA ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are capitalized and upon the closing of the associated equity transaction are reclassified to equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was not subject to any capital requirements.Income TaxesThe income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences and losses. No deferred tax has been recognized as at December 31, 2017, as the Company has recently been incorporated and therefore does not have any history of income.3. SubsidiariesThe principal subsidiaries of the Company, all of which have been included in these consolidated financial statements, are as follows:Name Country of Incorporation and Principal Place of BusinessProportion of Ownership Interest at December 31, 2017April 18, 2017Zamalight Holdco LLCUSA100%—%Zamalight Subco, Inc.USA100%—%Linde Holding GmbHGermany100%—%Linde Intermediate Holding AGGermany100%—%On May 26, 2017, the Company formed Zamalight Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Immediately following its formation, Zamalight Holdco LLC formed Zamalight Subco, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Zamalight Holdco LLC. Upon effectiveness of the Merger, Zamalight Subco, Inc. will merge with and into Praxair, Inc., with Praxair, Inc. surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 26, 2017, the Company formed Linde Holding GmbH, a German limited liability company (GmbH), which on July 28, 2017 in turn formed Linde Intermediate Holding AG, a German stock corporation (AG), to facilitate the settlement of the Exchange Offer and a post-completion reorganization with respect to Linde AG.4. Receivables from ShareholdersThis relates to a receivable from the two shareholders and comprises two checks of €25,000 each which are being held on behalf of the Company by Praxair, Inc.’s Irish legal counsel. Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value. 5. Other AssetsOther assets at December 31, 2017 of $9,129,562 relate to the costs to issue equity securities (SEC registration fee). When the business combination is completed, these costs will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In case the business combination is not completed, these costs will be expensed and reimbursed to Linde plc by Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG.29Table of Contents6. Accrued LiabilitiesAccrued liabilities at December 31, 2017 for the amount of $1,644,799 consist of expenses incurred in connection with the business combination and mainly relate to fees for accounting and advisory services.7.

Controls and ProceduresConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation of the effectiveness of Linde plc’s disclosure controls and procedures, which was made under the supervision and with the participation of management, including Linde plc’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that, as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Linde plc in reports that it files under the Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to management, including Linde plc’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in Linde plc’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Linde plc’s internal control over financial reporting.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThis Form 10-K does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of Linde plc's independent registered accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.Item 9B. Other InformationNone.32Table of ContentsPART IIIItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceCorporate Governance Structure of Linde plcOverviewLinde plc is required to comply with the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) (Ireland). However, there is no corporate governance regime applicable to Linde plc in Ireland because the Linde plc shares are not listed in Ireland. Following completion of the business combination, Linde plc will be subject to the corporate governance frameworks required by virtue of the listing of the Linde plc shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange. DirectorsLinde plc is currently managed by a board of directors with four directors, two designated by Praxair and two by Linde. Decisions of the board prior to the completion of the business combination may only be made by a majority of the directors. Under its existing constitution, the directors of Linde plc serve indefinitely and are not subject to annual re-election.The following individuals are currently the directors of Linde plc:33Table of Contents NameAgePresent Principal Occupation or Employment, Employment History and OtherDirectorships Held in the Last Five YearsGuillermo Bichara43Mr. Bichara was appointed Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Praxair, Inc. effective January 1, 2015.

He holds the position of company secretary at Linde plc. Mr. Brackfield is an English solicitor and holds a law degree from the University of Cambridge. Christopher Cossins51Mr. Cossins has served as Head of Tax, UK and Financial Restructuring for Linde since 2007. Mr. Cossins is also a Director of a number of Linde subsidiaries.

He holds the positions of principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of Linde plc. Mr. Cossins is a chartered accountant and holds an engineering degree from the University of Nottingham. Richard L. Steinseifer60Mr. Steinseifer was named vice president of Mergers and Acquisitions for Praxair, Inc. in 2005. He has primary responsibility for the implementation of all merger, acquisition, divestiture and joint-venture transactions for the company, its affiliates and subsidiaries.Mr. Steinseifer joined Praxair in 1996 as director of financial services for Praxair’s largest business unit, North American Industrial Gases.

Code of Ethics Linde plc has not adopted a code of ethics. Given the nature of the Company’s business, its limited shareholder base and current composition of management, the board does not believe that the Company requires a code of ethics at this time. 34Table of ContentsCommitteesLinde plc has not yet established an audit committee, a nomination and governance committee or a compensation committee. Executive Officers of the RegistrantChristopher Cossins is the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of Linde plc. For additional information about Mr. Cossins, see ""Directors"" included in this Item 10 above.Item 11. Executive CompensationAs of the date of this report, the Company has not paid any compensation to its directors or executive officer.Item 12.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director IndependenceDirector IndependenceThe Company has not established its own standard for determining whether its directors and nominees for directors are “independent” nor has it adopted any other standard of independence employed by any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system. Under the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, on which the Company’s stock is expected to be listed and traded following completion of the business combination, Messrs. Cossins and Brackfield would not be deemed to be “independent” given that Mr. Cossins is also the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of Linde plc and Mr. Brackfield is also the corporate secretary of Linde plc. In addition to serving as members of the Linde plc board of directors, Messrs. Brackfield and Cossins are employed by Linde. In this context, they participate in Linde’s share-based incentive program for executives, the Linde LTIP and the retention scheme which was set up by Linde in connection with the business combination and have entered into indemnification agreements with Linde. Besides this, Messrs. Brackfield and Cossins hold Linde shares. Messrs. Bichara and Steinseifer would not be deemed to be “independent” under the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange because in addition to serving as members of the Linde plc board of directors, Messrs. Bichara and Steinseifer are employed by Praxair, Inc. In their capacities as employees of Praxair, Inc., Messrs. Bichara and Steinseifer receive a salary which comprises, among others, equity awards. In this context, Messrs. Bichara and Steinseifer hold Praxair shares and other equity-based awards for Praxair. In their capacity as members of the Linde plc board of directors, Messrs. Bichara, Steinseifer, Brackfield and Cossins receive no compensation and none of them holds shares or equity-based instruments in Linde plc.Certain Relationships and TransactionsLinde plc has not yet adopted a policy for review of related person transactions. Given the nature of the Company’s business, its limited shareholder base and current composition of management, the board does not believe that the Company requires a policy at this time. 35Table of ContentsOn July 24, 2017 the Company entered into a cash management agreement with Praxair International Finance UC to finance the Company´s working capital obligations. The total available amount under the facility is €30,000,000. The cash management agreement is Euro denominated and has a variable interest rate of one month EUR LIBOR plus a 0% spread. The cash management agreement terminates on the earlier of the termination date of the business combination agreement or the business day immediately following the closing date of the business combination. At December 31, 2017, $9,501,470 was outstanding under this facility (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services The information required by this item is set forth below.Independent Auditor SelectionThe Company's board of directors has not yet established an audit committee. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the entire board of directors to serve the functions of an audit committee and to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors, such approval to take place in advance of such services when required by law, regulation, or rule, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act that are approved by the board prior to completion of the audit.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of the company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

AND LINDE AGLinde plc (""Linde"") is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement between Praxair, Inc. (""Praxair"") and Linde Aktiengesellschaft (""Linde AG""). On October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde plc (collectively referred to as the “business combination” or ""merger""). The business combination of Praxair and Linde AG has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Praxair for the periods prior to the merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of Linde. The results of Linde AG are included in Linde’s consolidated results from the merger date forward. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LIN”. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.In connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG, entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements required the sale of the majority of Praxair’s European businesses (completed on December 3, 2018), a significant portion of Linde AG’s Americas business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), select assets of Praxair's Indian industrial gases business (completed July 12, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's Indian industrial gases business (completed December 16, 2019) as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are currently expected to be sold in 2020 (collectively, the “merger-related divestitures”). In the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Praxair’s merger-related divestitures are included in the results of operations until sold and Linde AG’s merger-related divestitures are accounted for as discontinued operations. See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures. Additionally, to obtain merger approval in the United States Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission dated October 1, 2018 (“hold separate order” or “HSO”). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other’s operations; and not coordinate any aspect of their operations until certain divestitures in the United States were completed. Accordingly, Linde had accounted for Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date. Prior to the merger date, the company’s Linde AG segment did not exist. Since the FTC hold separate order restrictions were lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company subsequently implemented a new segment structure as follows: Americas; EMEA 21Table of Contents(Europe/Middle East/Africa); APAC (Asia/South Pacific) and Engineering. This new management organization structure was implemented during the first quarter 2019 and, accordingly, segment information has been retrospectively recast for all prior periods. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITYBecause Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses effective with the merger date of October 31, 2018, the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results and cash flows of the combined business, while the year ended December 31, 2018 includes twelve months of Praxair and two months of Linde AG. Due to the size of Linde AG’s businesses prior to the merger, the reported results for 2019 and 2018 periods are not comparable. The balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are comparable because both periods reflect the merger.Pro Forma Income Statement InformationTherefore, to assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a consolidated and segment basis (referred to as ""pro forma income statement information"" or ""pro forma information""). The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the merger and merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2018. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma Adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the business combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the business combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Pro forma information was not developed for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the business combination or any related restructuring costs. 22Table of ContentsBUSINESS OVERVIEWWith the merger, Linde is the leading industrial gas company worldwide. The company's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use; and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. Linde’s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2019 83% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 17% is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.Linde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following twelve geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North and South America (""Americas"") Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) Asia and Pacific (“APAC”)United States Germany China & TaiwanBrazil United Kingdom AustraliaMexico Eastern Europe South KoreaCanada IndiaThe company manufactures and distributes its industrial gas products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company’s customer base. The majority of Linde’s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, healthcare, food and beverage, and aerospace. 23Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK2019 Year in reviewOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock merger transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde plc. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018.•Sales of $28,228 million were 90% above 2018 sales of $14,836 million, primarily driven by the merger that contributed 89% to sales, net of divestitures. Underlying sales increased 1% driven by 3% higher pricing across all geographic segments and 1% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower cost pass-through. •Reported operating profit of $2,933 million was 44% below 2018 primarily driven by the net gain on sale of businesses in 2018 partially offset by the impact of the merger, including purchase accounting impacts, in the current year. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, for 2019 versus 2018, as the impacts of higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation.*•Income from continuing operations of $2,183 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.00 decreased from $4,273 million and $12.79, respectively in 2018. Adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations of $4,003 million and adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.34 were 17% and 19%, respectively above 2018 adjusted pro forma amounts.*•Cash flow from operations was $6,119 million, or 22% of sales. Capital expenditures were $3,682 million; dividends paid were $1,891 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,586 million; and debt repayments, net were $1,260 million.* A reconciliation of the adjusted pro forma amounts can be found in the ""Supplemental Pro Forma Income Statement Information"" and ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section in this MD&A. See Notes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.2020 OutlookThe company’s business is to build, own, and operate industrial gas plants in order to supply atmospheric and process gases to customers. As such, Linde believes that its sale of gas project backlog is one indicator of future sales growth. At December 31, 2019, Linde’s sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was $4.4 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction. APAC and Americas represent 64 percent and 29 percent of the backlog, respectively, with the remaining backlog in EMEA. These plants will primarily supply customers in the energy, chemical, and electronics end-markets.The above outlook should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”Linde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences. These materials are available on the company’s website, www.linde.com, but are not incorporated herein.24Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATIONThe following table provides summary information for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Results of OperationsThe following table provides a summary of changes in consolidated reported and pro forma sales: 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 % Change % Change Reported Pro forma ReportedFactors Contributing to Changes - Sales Volume 1 % 2 % 4 %Price/Mix 3 % 2 % 2 %Cost pass-through (1)% (1)% 1 %Currency (2)% (4)% (1)%Acquisitions/Divestitures 89 % 1 % 25 % 90 % — % 31 %2019 Compared With 2018 SalesReported sales increased $13,392 million, or 90% for the year primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures. On a pro forma basis sales increased $79 million in 2019 compared to 2018.On a reported basis, sales increased 90% to $28,228 million in 2019 compared to $14,836 million in 2018 primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures. Volume increased sales by 1% driven by higher volumes largely in the APAC segment, including new project start-ups. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Currency translation decreased sales by 2% driven by the weakening of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Chinese yuan against the US dollar. Lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. On a pro forma basis, sales were relatively flat with prior year. Volume growth of 2% was largely driven by higher volumes in the Americas and APAC segments, including new project start-ups. Higher pricing across the gases segments contributed 2% to sales. Unfavorable currency translation, primarily driven by the weakening of the Euro, British pound, Chinese yuan and Australian dollar, decreased sales by 4%. Lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Acquisitions, largely in the Americas segment, contributed 1% to sales.Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization Reported cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased $7,624 million, or 85%, for the year primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures. On a pro forma basis, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased $345 million or 2% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pro forma cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 58.9% of sales in the year versus 60.3% of sales for 2018. The decrease as a percentage of sales in the year was due primarily to higher pricing.Selling, general and administrative expensesReported selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses increased $1,828 million, or 112%, in 2019 to $3,457 million primarily due to the merger. On a pro forma basis, SG&A decreased $179 million, or 5%, versus the 2018 period. On a reported basis, SG&A increased 112% in 2019, primarily due to the merger. SG&A was 12.2% of sales in 2019 versus 11.0% in 2018, primarily due to the merger.26Table of ContentsOn a pro forma basis, SG&A decreased 5% in 2019 versus 2018. SG&A was 12.3% of sales in 2019 versus 12.9% in 2018. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $145 million in the 2019 period. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&A decreased due to cost reduction actions and productivity improvements which also drove the improvement of SG&A as a percentage of sales in the period. Depreciation and amortizationReported depreciation and amortization expense increased $2,845 million, or 155%, versus 2018. The increase is primarily due to the merger, including $1,940 million of purchase accounting impacts related to the depreciation and amortization of the fair value adjustments of fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in the merger. On a pro forma basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, or 5%, versus 2018. Currency movements decreased depreciation and amortization by approximately $197 million for the year. Excluding currency effects, depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $52 million, primarily driven by measurement period adjustments recognized in 2019 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by increases due to large project start-ups.Cost reduction programs and other chargesLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $567 million and $309 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to merger and synergy-related costs and an asset impairment in the third quarter 2019 of approximately $73 million related to a joint venture in APAC resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted pro forma basis, these costs have been eliminated in both periods. Operating profitReported operating profit decreased $2,314 million in 2019, or 44%, primarily driven by the net gain on sale of businesses in 2018 partially offset by the impact of the merger, including purchase accounting impacts, in the current year. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, for 2019 versus 2018.On a reported basis, operating profit decreased $2,314 million, or 44%. 2019 includes Linde AG's operating results for the full year and a gain on merger-related divestitures of $164 million, which was offset by $1,952 million which primarily related to $1,940 million of purchase accounting charges for additional depreciation and amortization, and $567 million in cost reduction program and other charges. 2018 included Linde AG's operating results from October 31, 2018 forward and a gain on merger-related divestitures of $3,294 million, partially offset by purchase accounting impacts of $714 million and $309 million of merger-related charges. On an adjusted pro forma basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges and net gains from merger-related divestitures, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, as the impacts of higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.Interest expense - netReported interest expense – net in 2019 decreased $164 million, or 81%, versus 2018. On an adjusted pro forma basis interest expense decreased $145 million, or 52% in 2019 as compared to 2018.On a reported basis, interest expense - net decreased $164 million in 2019 and included a decrease of $96 million related to purchase accounting impacts on the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. Excluding this purchase accounting impact, reported interest expense decreased $68 million in the year as interest on debt acquired in the merger was more than offset by higher interest income. On an adjusted pro forma basis, interest expense - net decreased $145 million in 2019 primarily due to lower debt levels and higher interest income.Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service costReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $32 million in 2019 versus a benefit of $4 million in 2018 and included pension settlement charges of $97 million and a net $8 million curtailment charge (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these charges, the net pension and OPEB benefit, excluding service cost increased $133 million in 2019, primarily due to the impact of pension and OPEB plans acquired in the merger.On an adjusted pro forma basis, net pension and OPEB (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $129 million in 2019 versus a benefit of $165 million in 2018.27Table of ContentsEffective tax rateThe reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2019 was 26.3% versus 16.2% in 2018. 2018 included the impact of the sale of Praxair's European industrial gas business (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted pro forma basis, the ETR for 2019 was 24.0% versus 25.8% in 2018.Income from equity investmentsReported income from equity investments for 2019 increased $58 million to $114 million largely related to investments in APAC and EMEA. This increase is primarily related to the merger. On an adjusted pro forma basis, income from equity investments for 2019 increased $55 million to $171 million. The increase is primarily related to increased earnings from equity investments. Noncontrolling interests from continuing operationsAt December 31, 2019, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $74 million to $89 million in 2019 from $15 million in 2018, primarily driven by the merger. 2019 noncontrolling interests includes a $33 million impact for an asset impairment charge in the third quarter related to a joint venture in APAC (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).On an adjusted pro forma basis, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $10 million in 2019 driven by higher income from continuing operations.Income from continuing operationsReported income from continuing operations decreased $2,090 million, or 49%, primarily due to the 2018 gain on merger-related divestitures, partially offset by the merger. Other impacts related to interest - net; net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost; income taxes; income from equity investments; and noncontrolling interest largely offset in the aggregate.On an adjusted pro forma basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other non-GAAP adjustments, income from continuing operations increased $570 million, or 17%, in 2019 primarily due to higher adjusted pro forma operating profit, lower adjusted pro forma interest expense-net, lower adjusted ETR, and higher adjusted pro forma income from equity investments.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $8.79, or 69%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net income from continuing operations and higher diluted shares outstanding as a result of the merger. On an adjusted pro forma basis, diluted EPS of $7.34 in 2019 increased 19% versus 2018, primarily due to higher adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding.EmployeesThe number of employees at December 31, 2019 was 79,886, a decrease of 934 employees from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by cost reduction actions partially offset by acquisitions. Other Financial DataEBITDA increased to $7,722 million in 2019 from $7,133 million in 2018, primarily due to the merger.Adjusted pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $8,178 million for 2019 as compared to $7,603 million in 2018 primarily due to higher income from continuing operations versus the prior year period. See the ""Supplemental Pro Forma Income Statement Information"" for pro forma amounts and ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" for adjusted pro forma amounts sections below for definitions and reconciliations of these pro forma and adjusted pro forma non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $435 million resulted primarily from a decrease in the funded status of the company's largest retirement programs. Driven by the low discount rate environment, 28Table of Contentsthe other comprehensive loss of $544 million related to the remeasurement of such retirement programs was partially offset by benefits from cumulative translation adjustments. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. See the ""Currency"" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment.2018 Compared With 2017 Sales increased 31% to $14,836 million in 2018 compared to $11,358 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the merger with Linde AG which contributed 25% to sales, net of divestitures. Underlying sales increased 6% driven by higher volumes and pricing. Volume growth of 4% was driven by higher volumes in North America and Asia, including new project start-ups. Higher overall pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales. Currency translation impact decreased sales by 1%. Higher cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. The divestiture of Praxair's European businesses in December of 2018 decreased sales by 1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $422 million, or 35%, in 2018 to $1,629 million primarily due to the merger. SG&A was 11.0% of sales in 2018 versus 10.6% in 2017, primarily due to the merger.Depreciation and amortization expense increased $646 million, or 55%, versus 2017. The increase is primarily due to the merger, including $346 million of purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in the merger. Cost reduction programs and other charges were $309 million and $52 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively and are primarily related to the merger. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Net gain on the sale of businesses was $3,294 million and related primarily to the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business in connection with the merger. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Other income (expenses) – net in 2018 was a $18 million benefit versus a $4 million benefit in 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of major components). In North America, 2018 included a $30 million asset impairment charge which was more than offset by $43 million of gains on asset disposals. In Asia, 2018 included a $22 million asset impairment charge, offset by a litigation settlement gain.Reported operating profit of $5,247 million in 2018 was $2,803 million, or 115% higher than reported operating profit of $2,444 million in 2017. 2018 includes a net gain on sale of businesses of $3,294 million, partially offset by transaction costs and other charges of $309 million, and purchase accounting impacts of $714 million related to the Linde AG merger (see Notes 4, 5 and 3, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements). 2017 included transaction costs of $52 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating profit of $2,976 million in 2018 was $480 million, or 19%, higher than adjusted operating profit of $2,496 million in 2017 driven primarily by the merger. Higher volumes and price in the geographic segments and surface technologies also contributed to operating profit growth. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows. Reported interest expense – net in 2018 increased $41 million, or 25%, versus 2017. 2018 included charges of $26 million relating to the early redemption of notes and a decrease of $21 million related to purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of debt acquired in the merger (see Notes 13 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively). Excluding these impacts, adjusted interest expense of $197 million increased $36 million, or 22%, largely attributable to interest on the debt acquired in the merger and lower capitalized interest. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to interest expense.The reported effective tax rate (""ETR"") for 2018 was 16.2% versus 44.9% in 2017. The decrease in the ETR for the 2018 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of the sale of Praxair's European industrial gases business. The increase in the ETR for the 2017 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the net $394 million charge related to the Tax Act. Excluding these and other smaller impacts as set forth in the ""Non-GAAP financial measures"" section of this MD&A, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2018 and 2017 periods was 23.8% and 27.2%, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact of the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Equity income increased $9 million in 2018 versus 2017 and included charges of $9 million for purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value step up of equity investments acquired in the merger. Excluding this impact, equity income increased $18 million, primarily driven by income from equity investments acquired in the merger.29Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2018, reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in Asia (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $46 million to $15 million in 2018 from $61 million in 2017. 2018 includes the impact of the merger and related purchase accounting impacts. Excluding these impacts, adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations of $73 million increased $12 million, or 20%, primarily due to noncontrolling interests acquired in the merger.Reported income from continuing operations for 2018 was $4,273 million, $3,026 million, or 243%, higher than reported income from continuing operations of $1,247 million in 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $2,121 million in 2018 was $431 million, or 26%, higher than adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,690 million in 2017 primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and a lower effective tax rate.Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (""EPS"") of $12.79 in 2018 increased $8.47 per diluted share, or 196% from $4.32 in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.35 in 2018 increased $.50 per diluted share, or 9%, from adjusted diluted EPS of $5.85 in 2017. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to the merger and higher adjusted income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in diluted shares resulting from equity acquired in the merger.Other comprehensive losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $299 million resulted primarily from (i) a $221 million unfavorable impact in the funded status of Linde's retirement obligations and (ii) adverse currency translation adjustments of $76 million, net of a benefit of $318 million related to the release of currency translation adjustments on Praxair's European business (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The decrease in the funded status of retirement obligations was primarily the result of higher current year actuarial losses, as the impact of higher U.S. discount rates was largely offset by a lower actual return on assets. Unfavorable translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar. Unfavorable currency translation adjustments included $343 million in South America and $149 million in Asia, partially offset by favorable currency translation adjustments of $231 million related to Linde AG (primarily Europe and Asia) representing translation impacts for the period from merger date through December 31, 2018. Remaining other comprehensive losses of $2 million relate to the amortization of deferred losses on the company's derivatives and unrealized losses on available for sale securities. Refer to the Currency section of the MD&A and Notes 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.The number of employees at December 31, 2018 was 80,820, an increase of 54,359 employees from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 56,000 related to the merger partially offset by a decrease of approximately 2,500 from the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business. Other Financial DataEarnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") increased $3,458 million to $7,133 million in 2018 from $3,675 million in 2017. EBITDA in 2018 includes a gain on sale of businesses and purchase accounting impacts, and both periods include transaction and other costs. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted EBITDA increased $789 million to $4,516 million in 2018 from $3,727 million in 2017 driven by the consolidation of Linde AG starting October 31, 2018, and higher adjusted income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization versus the prior year.See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for definitions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported amounts.Related Party TransactionsThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.Environmental MattersLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental 30Table of Contentsprotection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. Climate ChangeLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions, and Linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, GHGs are regulated in the European Union under the Emissions Trading System, which has wide implications for the company's customers and may impact certain operations of Linde in Europe. There are also requirements for mandatory reporting in Canada, which apply to certain Linde operations and will be used in developing cap-and-trade regulations on GHG emissions. These regulations are expected to impact certain Linde facilities in Canada. Climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies are also being widely introduced in jurisdictions throughout Latin America and parts of Asia. China has announced plans to implement its national carbon emissions trading system in 2020, though it does not appear the regulations will have a direct impact on GHG emissions from Linde facilities. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.Linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business, as hydrogen is essential to refineries that use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the United States and fuel standards in other regions. Hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.To manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. Linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG footprint through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, investment in renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. At the same time, Linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions, including GHG emissions, in Linde's processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.Costs Relating to the Protection of the EnvironmentEnvironmental protection costs in 2019 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2019, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based 31Table of Contentson historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.Legal ProceedingsSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.Retirement BenefitsPensionsThe net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. and international pension plans was $107 million in 2019, $24 million in 2018 and $58 million in 2017. The net periodic pension cost for 2019 includes pension settlement charges of $97 million related to lump sum payments, which were triggered by either a change in control provision or merger-related divestitures and a net curtailment charge of $8 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges for 2018 and 2017 were $14 million and $2 million, respectively. The funded status (pension benefit obligation (""PBO"") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $504 million as of December 31, 2019 and a deficit of $556 million at December 31, 2018. The funded status for international plans was a deficit of $1,801 million as of December 31, 2019 and a deficit of $1,241 million at December 31, 2018. In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impacts of unfavorable liability experience, resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience. Global pension contributions were $94 million in 2019, $87 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2017. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2020 are currently expected to be in the range of $50 million to $80 million.Linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2020 of 7.00% and 5.31% for the U.S. and international plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios. Excluding the impact of any settlements, 2020 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $45 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the amortization of deferred losses. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status.InsuranceLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers’ compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States, $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. In addition, the company self retains risk up to $5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils effecting its properties along with a separate $5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had recorded a total of $66 million and $60 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company’s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.Linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.32Table of ContentsSEGMENT DISCUSSIONEffective October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG completed the previously announced merger, resulting in the formation of Linde plc (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the merger). As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order effective on March 1, 2019, new operating segments were created which are used by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") to allocate company resources and assess performance. Linde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's new reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes remains unchanged - Segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. For a description of Linde's previous operating segments, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of Linde's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The table below presents sales and operating profit information about reportable segments and Other for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting (See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The historical periods prior to 2018 reflect the results of Praxair. Prior periods presented have been recast to be consistent with the new segment structure.:33Table of ContentsReported Variance(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017Sales Americas$10,993 $8,017 $7,204 37% 11%EMEA6,643 2,644 1,520 151% 74%APAC5,839 2,446 1,571 139% 56%Engineering2,799 459 N/A N/M N/AOther1,954 1,270 1,063 54% 19% $28,228 $14,836 $11,358 90% 31%Operating Profit Americas$2,578 $2,053 $1,854 26% 11%EMEA1,367 481 317 184% 52%APAC1,198 465 329 158% 41%Engineering390 14 N/A N/M N/AOther(245) (37) (4) N/M N/MSegment operating profit5,288 2,976 2,496 78% 19%Reconciliation to reported operating Profit : Cost reduction programs and other charges (Note 5)(567) (309) (52) Net gain on sale of businesses164 3,294 N/A Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG(1,952) (714) N/A Total operating profit$2,933 $5,247 $2,444 Pro Forma Variance(Dollar amounts in millions)Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018Sales Americas$10,989 $10,539 4 %EMEA6,643 6,991 (5)%APAC5,779 5,950 (3)%Engineering2,799 2,792 — %Other1,953 1,812 8 % $28,163 $28,084 — %Operating Profit Americas$2,577 $2,433 6 %EMEA1,367 1,344 2 %APAC1,184 1,029 15 %Engineering390 285 37 %Other(246) (295) (17)%Segment operating profit$5,272 $4,796 10 %34Table of ContentsAmericas Variance(Dollar amounts in millions)Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 Reported sales$10,993 $8,017 $7,204 37% 11%Pro forma sales$10,989 $10,539 N/A 4% N/A Reported operating profit$2,578 $2,053 $1,854 26% 11%As a percent of sales23.5% 25.6% 25.7% Pro forma operating profit$2,577 $2,433 N/A 6% N/AAs a percent of sales23.5% 23.1% N/A 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 % Change % Change Reported Pro forma Reported Factors Contributing to Changes - Sales Volume/Equipment — % 1 % 3 % Price/Mix 3 % 3 % 2 % Cost pass-through (1)% (1)% 1 % Currency (2)% (2)% (2)% Acquisitions/Divestitures 37 % 3 % 7 % 37 % 4 % 11 % The Americas segment includes Linde’s industrial gases operations in approximately 20 countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.SalesReported sales for the Americas segment for 2019 increased $2,976 million, or 37%, versus 2018, primarily due to the merger.

For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde’s results of operations in any given period.To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of2019ConsolidatedSales Statements of Income Balance Sheets Average Year Ended December 31, December 31,Currency2019 2018 2017 2019 2018Euro20% 0.89 0.85 0.89 0.89 0.87Chinese yuan7% 6.90 6.60 6.76 6.96 6.88British pound6% 0.78 0.75 0.78 0.75 0.78Australian dollar4% 1.44 1.34 N/A 1.42 1.42Brazilian real4% 3.94 3.63 3.19 4.03 3.87Korean won3% 1,165 1,100 1,131 1,156 1,111Canadian dollar3% 1.33 1.30 1.30 1.30 1.36Mexican peso2% 19.24 19.20 18.86 18.93 19.65Taiwan dollar2% 30.90 30.13 30.43 29.99 30.55Indian rupee2% 70.40 68.00 65.00 71.38 69.77South African rand1% 14.43 13.16 N/A 14.00 14.35Swedish kroner1% 9.45 8.68 8.53 9.37 8.85Thailand bhat1% 31.04 32.30 33.91 29.71 32.33 42Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities Income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests)$2,272 $4,288 $1,308Non-cash charges (credits): Add: Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments (a)(236) 40 26 Add: Amortization of merger-related inventory step-up12 368 — Less: Net gain on sale of businesses, net of tax (b)(108) (2,923) — Add: Tax Act income tax charge, net— (61) 394 Add: Depreciation and amortization4,675 1,830 1,184 Add (Less): Deferred income taxes, excluding Tax Act(303) (187) 136 Add (Less): non-cash charges and other (32) 237 102 Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash charges and other6,280 3,592 3,150Less: Pension contributions(94) (87) (19)Add (Less): Working capital(160) 202 (158)Add (Less): Other93 (53) 68Net cash provided by operating activities$6,119 $3,654 $3,041Investing Activities Capital expenditures$(3,682) $(1,883) $(1,311)Acquisitions, net of cash acquired(225) (25) (33)Divestitures and asset sales, net of cash divested5,096 5,908 30Cash acquired in merger transaction— 1,363 —Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$1,189 $5,363 $(1,314)Financing Activities Debt increases (decreases) – net$(1,260) $(2,908) $(771)Issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares – net(2,586) (522) 108Cash dividends – Linde plc shareholders(1,891) (1,166) (901)Noncontrolling interest transactions and other(3,260) (402) (92)Net cash (used) for financing activities$(8,997) $(4,998) $(1,656) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash$(77) $(60) $22Cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period$2,700 $4,466 $617 ____________________(a)See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.(b)See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Cash decreased $1,766 million in 2019 versus 2018. The primary sources of cash in 2019 were cash flows from operations of $6,119 million and proceeds from divestitures and asset sales of $5,096 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $3,682 million, transactions with noncontrolling interests of $3,260 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,586 million, cash dividends to shareholders of $1,891 million and net debt repayments of $1,260 million. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other of $3,260 million included a payment of approximately $3.2 billion related to the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).43Table of ContentsCash Flows From Operations 2019 compared with 2018Cash flows from operations was $6,119 million, or 22% of sales, an increase of $2,465 million from $3,654 million, or 25% of sales in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the merger which drove higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and higher merger and synergy related cash outflows. 2019 included merger and synergy related cash outflows of $803 million, of which $567 million is included within ""Net income (including noncontrolling interests)"" and $236 million is included within ""Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments"".2018 compared with 2017Cash flows from operations was $3,654 million, or 25% of sales, an increase of $613 million from $3,041 million, or 27% of sales in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the merger, higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and favorable working capital requirements, partially offset by unfavorable changes in other long–term assets and liabilities and higher pension contributions. 44Table of ContentsInvesting2019 compared with 2018Net cash provided by investing activities of $1,189 million decreased $4,174 million from 2018 primarily driven by lower proceeds from merger-related divestitures, cash acquired in the merger and higher capital expenditures.Capital expenditures in 2019 were $3,682 million, an increase of $1,799 million from 2018, driven primarily by the merger. Capital expenditures during 2019 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 44% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 33% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.Acquisition expenditures in 2019 were $225 million, an increase of $200 million from 2018 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas. Divestitures and asset sales in 2019 totaled $5,096 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures including $3.4 billion from the sale of Linde AG's Americas business, $1.2 billion from the sale of Linde Korea, and approximately $200 million each from the sale of the legacy Praxair and legacy Linde India selected assets (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 2018 divestiture and asset sale cash flows included $5.6 billion from the sale of Praxair's European business and $214 million related to the sale of Praxair's Italian joint venture (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).2018 compared with 2017Net cash provided by investing activities of $5,363 million increased $6,677 million from 2017 primarily driven by proceeds from the divestiture of Praxair's European business and cash acquired in the merger, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.Capital expenditures in 2018 were $1,883 million, an increase of $572 million from 2017, driven primarily by the merger with Linde AG. Capital expenditures during 2019 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth and density. Acquisition expenditures in 2018 were $25 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2017. Additionally, $1,363 million of cash was acquired in the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2018 totaled $5,908 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures including $5.6 billion from the sale of Praxair's European business and $214 million related to the sale of Praxair's Italian joint venture (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).45Table of ContentsFinancingLinde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).Cash used for financing activities was $8,997 million in 2019 compared to $4,998 million in 2018. The primary financing uses of cash were for transactions with noncontrolling interests, net debt repayments, cash dividends and net purchases of Linde ordinary shares. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other payments of $3,260 million increased $2,858 million from 2018 driven by a payment of approximately $3.2 billion for the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). Amounts paid in 2018 include $315 million for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Praxair's Italian joint venture in a merger-related transaction (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and $25 million in interest related to the early redemption of bonds. Cash dividends of $1,891 million increased $725 million from 2018 driven primarily by higher shares outstanding after the merger and a 6% increase in dividends per share from $3.30 to $3.50. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $2,586 million in 2019 versus $522 million in 2018 driven by increased share repurchases. The cash used for debt repayments-net of $1,260 million decreased $1,648 million from $2,908 million during 2018 while cash decreased $1,766 million. Net debt (calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) increased $426 million primarily due to lower cash balances partially offset by debt repayments.The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2019, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt repayments in 2019, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 14 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2019 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.Linde’s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $11,256 million, $426 million higher than $10,830 million at December 31, 2018. The December 31, 2019 net debt balance includes $12,752 million in public securities, $1,204 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $2,700 million of cash. Linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2% for 2019. In February 2019, Linde repaid $500 million of 1.90% rate notes that became due; in May 2019 Linde repaid $150 million of variable rate notes that became due; in June 2019 Linde repaid €500 million of 1.75% notes that due and AUD100 million of variable rate notes that became due; in August 2019 Linde repaid $200 million of variable rate notes that became due.On March 26, 2019 the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (""the Credit Agreement"") with a syndicate of banking institutions, which became effective on March 29, 2019. The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, Praxair and Linde AG terminated their respective existing revolving credit facilities. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.On September 3, 2019, Linde and the company’s subsidiaries Praxair and Linde AG entered into a series of parent and subsidiary guarantees related to currently outstanding notes issued by Praxair and Linde AG as well as the $5 billion Credit Agreement.On December 10, 2018, the company announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed in February of 2019. On January 22, 2019, the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares, of which $2.3 billion had been repurchased through December 31, 2019. For additional information 46Table of Contentsrelated to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table sets forth Linde’s material contract obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019: (Millions of dollars)Due or expiring by December 31, 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt obligations: Debt and capitalized lease maturities (Note 13)$1,531 $1,855 $2,330 $1,798 $983 $3,727 $12,224Contractual interest297 237 175 146 98 585 1,538Operating leases (Note 6)275 208 163 110 75 251 1,082Retirement obligations101 36 37 37 36 183 430Unconditional purchase obligations 833 769 718 660 650 2,877 6,507Construction commitments2,234 871 291 25 — — 3,421Total Contractual Obligations$5,271 $3,976 $3,714 $2,776 $1,842 $7,623 $25,202Contractual interest on long-term debt of $1,538 million represents interest the company is contracted to pay on outstanding long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, calculated on a basis consistent with planned debt maturities, excluding the interest impact of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2019, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,799 million and floating-rate debt of $3,157 million. The rate assumed for floating-rate debt was the rate in effect at December 31, 2019.Retirement obligations of $430 million include estimates of pension plan contributions and expected future benefit payments for unfunded pension and OPEB plans. Pension plan contributions are forecasted for 2020 only. For purposes of the table, $60 million of estimated contributions have been included for 2020. Expected future unfunded pension and OPEB benefit payments are forecasted only through 2029. Contribution and unfunded benefit payment estimates are based upon current valuation assumptions. Estimates of pension contributions after 2020 and unfunded benefit payments after 2029 are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Retirement obligations are more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.Unconditional purchase obligations of $6,507 million represent contractual commitments under various long and short-term take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers and are not included on Linde's balance sheet. These obligations are primarily minimum-purchase commitments for helium, electricity, natural gas and feedstock used to produce atmospheric and process gases. A significant portion of these obligations is passed on to customers through similar take-or-pay or other contractual arrangements. Purchase obligations that are not passed along to customers through such contractual arrangements are subject to market conditions, but do not represent a material risk to Linde. Approximately $2,983 million of the purchase obligations relates to power and is intended to secure the uninterrupted supply of electricity and feedstock to Linde's plants to reliably satisfy customer product supply obligations, and extend through 2030. Certain of the power contracts contain various cancellation provisions requiring supplier agreement, and many are subject to annual escalations based on local inflation factors. Construction commitments of $3,421 million represent outstanding commitments to complete authorized construction projects as of December 31, 2019. A significant portion of Linde’s capital spending is related to the construction of new production facilities to satisfy customer commitments which may take a year or more to complete.Liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $415 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Tax liabilities for deemed repatriation of earnings of $261 million are payable over the next six years. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding the ""Tax Act"" and uncertain income tax positions.47Table of ContentsOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2019, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde’s Audit Committee.Purchase AccountingLinde AG’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger. Estimates of fair value represent management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties. In determining the fair value, Linde utilized various forms of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value includes significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables and others. Inputs were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. As of the end of 2019, the valuation process to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is complete.See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciable Lives of Property, Plant and EquipmentLinde’s net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 was $29,064 million, representing 34% of the company’s consolidated total assets. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,940 million, or 16% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on-site customers. Circumstances and events relating to these assets, such as on-site contract modifications, are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see “Asset Impairments”) are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Linde’s largest asset values relate to cryogenic air-separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years.Based upon the assets as of December 31, 2019, if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately $471 million or increased by approximately $618 million, respectively.See Notes 3, 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Amortization of Other Intangible AssetsLinde’s net other intangible assets at December 31, 2019 was $16,137 million, representing 19% of the company’s consolidated total assets, including $1,870 million of indefinite-lived intangibles. Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $735 million, or 3% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated amortizable lives that are used to calculate the annual amortization expense and accumulated amortization. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.48Table of ContentsBased upon the assets as of December 31, 2019, if amortization lives of other intangible assets, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual amortization expense would be decreased by approximately $33 million or increased by approximately $36 million, respectively.See Notes 3, 9, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Revenue RecognitionLong-Term Construction Contracts The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Pension BenefitsPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year (e.g., divestiture-related settlement charges, settlement charges resulting from change in control provisions, etc.).The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.27% for U.S. plans and 5.15% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2019 (7.62% and 5.13%, respectively at December 31, 2018). The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $44 million.The company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $8,778 million, or $158 million lower than the fair value of assets of $8,936 million at December 31, 2019. These net deferred investment losses of $158 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.Discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. The company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant U.S. and international plans using the spot rate approach. U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement 49Table of Contentsdate. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2019 benefit costs. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would increase Linde’s pension expense by approximately $29 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of $25 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $976 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $855 million. The weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.46% for international plans at December 31, 2019 (3.25% and 2.38%, respectively, at December 31, 2018). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde’s pension expense by approximately $8 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $65 million.Asset ImpairmentsGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles AssetsAt December 31, 2019, the company had goodwill of $27,019 million and $1,870 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process. The change in annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The company has determined this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable. The impairment tests performed during the second and fourth quarters of 2019 indicated no impairment. At December 31, 2019, Linde’s enterprise value was approximately $125 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus net debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $63 billion.The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the company’s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. Such analysis requires the use of certain market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. As applicable, estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company's control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, and technological changes. Management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2019 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the recent merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets from Linde AG recently fair valued are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.See Notes 3, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which 50Table of Contentsthere are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model, for property, plant and equipment an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. Income TaxesAt December 31, 2019, Linde had deferred tax assets of $2,179 million (net of valuation allowances of $222 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $8,825 million. At December 31, 2019, uncertain tax positions totaled $472 million (see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or about 26.3% of pre-tax income (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions. The company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.ContingenciesThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations.Linde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.51Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION To assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a consolidated and segment basis (referred to as ""pro forma Income Statement Information"" or ""pro forma information""). The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the merger and the merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and includes adjustments for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impacts of the merger, including increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment and lower interest expense due to revaluing existing debt to fair value, (2) conversion to US GAAP from IFRS for Linde AG, (3) accounting policy alignment, (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG, (5) the elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement and (6) the elimination of the effect of consummated and probable divestitures required as a condition of the approval for the merger. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma Adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the business combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the merger and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the merger or any related restructuring costs. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g. inventory step-up costs, non-recurring income/charges) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma income statement has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Linde's results of operation actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statement does not purport to project the future operating results of the company.The pro forma Income Statement Information are included in the following schedules:- Year ended December 31, 2019 pro forma Income Statement Information- Year ended December 31, 2018 pro forma Income Statement InformationRefer to an earlier section in this MD&A titled ""Merger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG"".52Table of ContentsYEAR TO DATE DECEMBER 31, 2019 PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION(Millions of dollars, except per share data)(UNAUDITED) Pro forma Adjustments Linde plc ReportedDivestitures (a)Other TotalPro FormaSales$28,228$(65)$— $(65)$28,163Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation16,644(48)(12)(b)(60)16,584Selling, general and administrative3,457(1) (1)3,456 As a % of Sales12.2% 12.3%Depreciation and amortization4,675 —4,675Research and development184 —184Cost reduction programs and other charges567(190)(c)(190)377Net gain on sale of businesses164(164)(d)(164)—Other income (expense) - net68 —68Operating profit2,933(16)38 222,955 Operating margin10.4% 10.5%Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service costs(32)(97)(e)(97)(129)Interest expense - net38 —38Income taxes769(5)(15)(f)(20)749 Effective Tax Rate26.3% 24.6%Income from equity investments114 —114Noncontrolling interests from continuing operations(89) —(89)Income from continuing operations$2,183$(11)$150 $139$2,322Diluted shares outstanding545,170 545,170545,170Diluted EPS from continuing operations$4.00 $0.25$4.25SEGMENT SALES Americas$10,993$(4)$— $(4)$10,989EMEA6,643 —6,643APAC5,839(60) (60)5,779Engineering2,799 —2,799Other1,954(1) (1)1,953Segment sales$28,228$(65)$— $(65)$28,163SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT Americas$2,578$(1)$— $(1)$2,577EMEA1,367 1,367APAC1,198(14) (14)1,184Engineering390 390Other(245)(1) (1)(246)Segment operating profit5,288(16)— (16)5,272Cost reduction programs and other charges(567) —(567)Net gain on sale of businesses164 —164Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG(1,952) —(1,952)Total operating profit$2,933$(16)$— $(16)$2,91753Table of Contents2019 Pro forma adjustments (a)To eliminate the results of Praxair's merger-related divestitures.

Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchasing accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements.A summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows:Adjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 include (i) a $12 million adjustment for the increase in cost of sales related to the fair value step up of inventories acquired in the merger (included as a pro forma adjustment), and (ii) $1,940 in depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger. Adjusted Interest Expense - Net: Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.Adjusted Income from Equity Investments: Represents the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets. Adjusted Noncontrolling Interests from Continuing Operations: Represents the noncontrolling interests’ ownership portion of the adjustments described above determined on an entity by entity basis.60Table of ContentsNet Debt and Adjusted Net DebtNet debt is a financial liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to evaluate the ability of a company to repay its debt.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2019. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2019, Linde had debt totaling $13,956 million ($15,296 million at December 31, 2018). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2019, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,799 million and floating-rate debt of $3,157 million, representing 77% and 23%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2018, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,565 million and floating-rate debt of $2,731 million, representing 82% and 18%, respectively, of total debt. Fixed Rate DebtIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2019, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $473 million ($594 million in 2018). A one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $73 million increase to derivative assets recorded.Variable Rate DebtAt December 31, 2019, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $48 million ($24 million in 2018).Foreign Currency RiskLinde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in Latin America (primarily Brazil, Chile and Colombia), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom), Canada, Mexico, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia, China) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2019, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $9,713 million ($9,412 million at December 31, 2018) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Holding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% increase in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $194 million and at December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $307 million, which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.62Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Quarterly Data (Unaudited)13163Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLinde’s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.Linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGLinde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.Linde’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 did not include the internal control over financial reporting related to Linde AG which was acquired by Praxair in a merger accounted for as a business combination. In connection with its antitrust review of the transaction, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) imposed a Hold Separate Order (the “HSO”) on Linde that was lifted on March 1, 2019 after all required asset divestitures in the U.S. were completed. The HSO required the companies to continue to operate globally as separate and independent companies apart from each other in all material respects. As such, the HSO regulatory restrictions prohibited Linde from being able to perform procedures necessary to complete an overall assessment of Linde AG’s disparate internal control environment with operations in over 100 countries. Because of this, the assessment of Linde AG’s internal control environment could only begin after the HSO was terminated on March 1, 2019, and as such Linde AG has been excluded from the overall Linde internal control assessment as of December 31, 2019.Total assets and sales for Linde AG represent approximately 23% and 62%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as stated in their report. /s/ STEPHEN F. ANGEL /s/ KELCEY E. HOYTStephen F. AngelChief Executive Officer Kelcey E. HoytChief Accounting Officer/s/ MATTHEW J. WHITE Matthew J. WhiteChief Financial Officer March 2, 202064Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plcOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Linde Aktiengesellschaft (""Linde AG"") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because it was acquired in a merger accounted for as a business combination during 2018 and subject to a hold separate order issued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission until March 2019. We have also excluded Linde AG from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Linde AG is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 23% and 62%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 65Table of Contentsgenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at CompletionAs described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,799 million of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was generated from the sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the estimated costs at completion and management’s significant assumptions, including the estimated expected material and labor costs. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, including the estimated expected material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions involved evaluating management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the expected material and labor costs.Goodwill Impairment AssessmentAs described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $27,019 million as of December 31, 2019. Management performs an impairment test annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 66Table of Contentsvalue then management will estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the Company’s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units, ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multiples of earnings model, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating management’s significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the multiples of earnings involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the consistency with external market and industry data and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s multiples of earnings model and significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPStamford, ConnecticutMarch 2, 2020We have served as the Company’s or its

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. FORMATION OF LINDE PLC AND BUSINESS COMBINATION OF PRAXAIR, INC. AND LINDE AGFormation of Linde plcLinde plc (""Linde"" or “the company”), a public limited company incorporated in Ireland, was formed in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated as of June 1, 2017, as amended (the “business combination agreement”). Pursuant to the business combination agreement, among other things, Praxair, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Praxair”), and Linde Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Germany (“Linde AG”), agreed to combine their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of the company (collectively referred to as “business combination” or “merger”). On October 31, 2018, Linde completed the business combination. Prior to the business combination, the company did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the business combination agreement. Business Combination of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AGThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 805, “Business Combinations”, with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, as of October 31, 2018, the company became the successor issuer to Praxair. Also, the Linde shares are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LIN”. Prior to the business combination, the Praxair shares were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE. In connection with the completion of the business combination, the Praxair shares were suspended from trading on the NYSE as of close of business (New York Time) on October 30, 2018. On November 1, 2018, Praxair filed a Form 25 to de-list and de-register its three series of Euro-denominated notes, including its 1.50%Notes due 2020, 1.20% Notes due 2024 and 1.625% Notes due 2025, that were listed on the NYSE. Trading of the Euro-denominated notes on the NYSE was suspended as of close of business (New York Time) on November 9, 2018, and Praxair filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration under the Exchange Act of its securities and suspending Praxair’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements included the sale of the majority of Praxair’s European businesses (completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG’s Americas business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), select assets of Praxair's Indian industrial gases business (completed July 12, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's Indian industrial gases business (completed December 16, 2019) as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are currently expected to be sold in 2020 (collectively, the “merger-related divestitures”). See Note 4 for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures. Additionally, to obtain merger approval in the United States Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") dated October 1, 2018 (“hold separate order” or “HSO”). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other’s operations; and not coordinate any aspect of their operations until certain divestitures in the United States were completed. Accordingly, Linde had accounted for Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date. Prior to the merger date, the company’s Linde AG segment did not exist. Since the FTC hold separate order restrictions were lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company subsequently implemented a new segment structure as follows: Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), APAC (Asia/South Pacific) and Engineering. This new management organization structure was implemented during the first quarter 2019 and, accordingly, segment information has been retrospectively recast for all prior periods. Refer to Note 20 Segment Information for further details.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("" U.S. GAAP"") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary 75Table of Contentsbeneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Equity income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations (""LLC"") is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have incurred. Changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.Operations – Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases, and high-performance surface coatings to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde’s Engineering business offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including suppling plant components and services directly to customers.Revenue Recognition – Effective January 1, 2018, Linde adopted the FASB's Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (""ASC 606"") relating to Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 21 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in no differences in revenue recognition compared to previous policies.Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.Inventories – Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment – Net – Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities (see Note 10). Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 10). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.The company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.Asset-Retirement Obligations – An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at discounted fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company’s asset-retirement obligations are primarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation – For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 9). Financial Instruments – Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.76Table of ContentsThere are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Provided the hedge remains highly effective, any ineffectiveness is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to anticipated net income and currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.See Note 14 for additional information relating to financial instruments.Goodwill – Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the company’s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.See Notes 3 and 11 for additional information relating to goodwill.Other Intangible Assets – Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and brands/tradenames, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred. See Notes 3 and 12 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – Assets held for sale, as well as liabilities directly related to these assets, are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets as held for sale if the requirements of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are satisfied. The main requirements of 77Table of ContentsASC 360 are: (i) management having the authority to approve the action has committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (ii) the assets are available for sale in their present condition at a reasonable market price, and (iii) a sale within the next twelve months is probable. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Amortization and depreciation has been discontinued. The process involved in determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.Discontinued operations are reported as soon as a business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and when the business to be disposed of represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the company’s operations and financial results. Businesses acquired with the intent of divesting are also required to be reported as discontinued operations. The profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations. The information provided in the Notes relates to continuing operations. If the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted accordingly.See Note 4 for additional information relating to assets held for sale and discontinued operations.Income Taxes – Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.Under the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. See Note 7 for additional information relating to income taxes, including the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.Retirement Benefits – Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees’ expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices. See Note 18 for additional information relating to retirement programs.Share-based Compensation– The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. See Note 17 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.Reclassifications – Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.Segment Presentation Change - As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order in March 2019, new reportable segments were implemented. The new segments are: Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), APAC (Asia/South Pacific); and Engineering. All periods presented were recast to conform to the new segment structure. See Note 20.78Table of ContentsRecently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Implemented in 2019 •Leases – In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting and financial statement presentation of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, except those that meet certain scope exceptions, and requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This guidance is effective beginning in 2019 and requires companies to transition using a modified retrospective approach. Linde has applied the practical expedient which allows prospective transition to the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. The company elected the package of practical expedients relating to the reassessment of the lease portfolio pertaining to (i) whether expiring or existing contracts contain lease components, (ii) lease classification under ASC 842 and (iii) whether initial direct costs were capitalized under ASC 840. The company further implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. The standard had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated income statements. The most significant impact was the recognition of right of use (""ROU"") assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while the accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. The company recognized both right of use assets and lease liabilities of $1.2 billion upon adoption. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard had no impact on retained earnings (See Note 6). •Derivatives and Hedging - In August 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for hedging activities. The new guidance simplifies hedge effectiveness documentation requirements, changes both the designation and measurement for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This guidance was effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of the standard had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.Accounting Standards to be Implemented•Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – In June 2016, the FASB issued an update on the measurement of credit losses. The guidance introduces a new accounting model for expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on estimates of current expected credit losses. This guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 and requires companies to apply the change in accounting on a prospective basis. The company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.•Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment – In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 with early adoption permitted. The company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.•Fair Value Measurement Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments must be applied prospectively while other amendments must be applied retrospectively. The company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.•Retirement Benefit Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.79Table of ContentsNOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONMerger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AGAs described in Note 1, on October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company. In connection with the business combination, each share of common stock of Praxair par value $0.01 per share, (excluding any shares held in treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which were automatically canceled and retired for no consideration) was converted into one ordinary share, par value €0.001 per share, of Linde plc. Additionally, each tendered share of common stock of Linde AG was converted into 1.54 ordinary shares of Linde plc. As provided in the business combination agreement, at the effective time of the business combination outstanding Praxair stock options and other equity awards were generally converted into stock options and equity awards on a 1:1 basis with respect to Linde shares. Outstanding Linde AG share-based compensation awards were either settled in cash (for the portion vested), or were converted into similar stock options and equity awards with respect to Linde shares (for the portion unvested), after giving effect to the 1.54 exchange ratio. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information.Allocation of Purchase PriceIn accordance with the FASB’s ASC 805, ""Business Combinations"", Praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer. As such, the company has applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Linde AG, which have been measured at fair value as of the date of the business combination.In accordance with the business combination agreement, Linde AG shareholders that accepted the exchange offer received Linde shares in exchange for Linde AG shares at an exchange ratio of 1.54 Linde shares for each Linde AG share. Because Praxair is the accounting acquirer, the fair value of the equity issued by Linde plc to Linde AG shareholders in the exchange transaction was determined by reference to the market price of Praxair shares. Accordingly, the purchase consideration below reflects the estimated fair value of the 92% of Linde AG shares tendered and Linde shares issued in exchange for those Linde AG shares, which is based on the final closing price of Praxair shares prior to the effective time of the merger on October 31, 2018 of $164.50 per share. The purchase price and fair value of Linde AG’s net assets acquired as of the merger date on October 31, 2018 is presented as follows: (in thousands, except value per share data, Linde AG exchange ratio, and purchase price)Linde AG common stock tendered as of October 31, 2018 (i)170,875 SharesBusiness combination agreement exchange ratio (ii)1.54 : 1Linde plc ordinary shares issued in exchange for Linde AG263,148Per share price of Praxair, Inc. common stock (iii)$164.50Purchase price (millions of dollars)$43,288 (i)Number of Linde AG shares tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offer. (ii)Exchange ratio for Linde AG shares as set forth in the business combination agreement. (iii)Closing price of Praxair shares on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the effective time of the business combination on October 31, 2018.In accordance with ASC 805, Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at fair value at October 31, 2018, primarily using Level 3 inputs except debt which was Level 1. Fair value represents management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables, and others. Inputs used were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Linde made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the effective date of the Merger. The more significant measurement period adjustments made reflect: the agreed upon sale price of Linde AG’s Korean business resulting in an increase to assets held for sale and corresponding decrease to goodwill of $344 million; an adjustment to the sale value of the Linde AG Americas businesses resulting in a decrease to assets held for sale and corresponding increase to goodwill of $211 million; refinement in the 80Table of Contentsvaluation of other intangible assets resulting in an increase to intangible asset values and corresponding decrease to goodwill of $657 million; refinement in the valuation of property, plant and equipment resulting in a decrease to property, plant and equipment and corresponding increase to goodwill of $407 million; an increase to deferred income taxes with a corresponding increase to goodwill of $276 million; and an increase to the fair value of noncontrolling interest with a corresponding increase to goodwill of $222 million. The net impact of these and other less significant adjustments made during the twelve month period resulted in a net increase of $110 million to goodwill. The valuation process to determine the fair values is complete. The following table summarizes the final allocation of purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Linde, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Linde AG’s net assets recorded as goodwill.Millions of dollarsFair ValueAssets Cash and cash equivalents$1,360Accounts receivable – net2,857Inventories1,439Assets held for sale5,375Prepaid and other current assets1,251Property, plant and equipment18,974Equity investments1,521Goodwill24,256Other intangible assets16,250Other long-term assets805Total Assets Acquired$74,088Less: Liabilities Assumed Accounts payable$3,360Short-term debt1,177Current portion of long-term debt1,864Accrued taxes159Liabilities of assets held for sale676Other current liabilities3,058Long-term debt6,295Other long-term liabilities2,009Deferred credits, including deferred income taxes6,834Total Liabilities Assumed$25,432Less: Redeemable noncontrolling interests92Less: Noncontrolling interests5,276Purchase Price (i)$43,288 (i)See above for the calculation of the purchase price. Summary of Significant Fair Value MethodsThe methods used to determine the fair value of significant identifiable assets and liabilities included in the allocation of purchase price are discussed below.InventoriesAcquired inventory is comprised of finished goods, work in process and raw materials. The fair value of finished goods was calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for costs of the selling effort and a reasonable profit allowance relating to the selling effort. The fair value of work in process inventory was primarily calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for estimated costs to complete the manufacturing, estimated costs of the selling effort, as well as a reasonable profit 81Table of Contentsmargin on the remaining manufacturing and selling effort. The fair value of raw materials and supplies was determined based on replacement cost which approximates historical carrying value. The fair value step-up of inventories is being recognized in “Cost of sales” as the inventory is sold. Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for saleAs described in Note 1, as a condition of the European Commission (""EC""), the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ""), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, Linde plc, Praxair and Linde AG were required to divest various businesses in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The fair value of these businesses has been determined based on the estimated net selling prices or sales agreements. See Note 4 for further information on merger-related divestitures.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe fair value of property, plant and equipment was primarily calculated using replacement costs adjusted for the age and condition of the asset, and is summarized below:Property, plant and equipment (""PP&E"")(in millions)Production plants$10,358Storage tanks1,807Transportation equipment and other543Cylinders2,487Buildings1,953Land and improvements677Construction in progress1,149Fair value of PP&E$18,974Identifiable Intangible AssetsThe fair value of identifiable intangible assets is summarized below: Weighted Average Amortization Period (in years) (in millions)Identifiable intangible assets Customer relationships29 $12,550 Linde brandIndefinite 1,868 Brands/Tradenames28 845 Other intangibles18 987Fair value of identifiable intangible assets28 $16,250The fair value for all other identifiable intangible assets is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from Linde AG’s existing customer base. Excess earnings are the earnings remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated values of contributory assets, including debt-free net working capital, tangible assets, and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess earnings are thereby calculated for each year of multi-year projection periods and discounted to present value.Other intangibles primarily includes acquired technology. Linde brand, brands/tradenames and other intangibles were valued using the relief from royalty method under the income approach; this method estimates the cost savings generated by a company related to the ownership of an asset for which it would otherwise have had to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset and discounted to present value.Pension and Other Postretirement Liabilities82Table of ContentsLinde recognized a pretax net liability representing the unfunded portion of Linde AG’s defined-benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (""OPEB"") plans. Refer to Note 18 for further information on pensions and OPEB arrangements.Long-Term DebtThe fair value for long-term debt was primarily obtained from third party quotes, as the majority of the Linde AG bond portfolio is publicly traded. Deferred Income Tax Assets and LiabilitiesThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities include the expected future federal, state and foreign tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the respective tax bases. Tax rates utilized in calculating deferred income taxes generally represent the enacted statutory tax rates at the effective date of the merger in the jurisdictions in which legal title of the underlying asset or liability resides. Refer to Note 7 for further information related to income taxes. Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests include the fair value of noncontrolling interests of Linde AG, including approximately $3.2 billion relating to the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out. The company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Linde Intermediate Holding AG (""Linde Holding""), which directly owns the 92% of Linde AG shares acquired in the Exchange Offer, determined the adequate cash compensation to be paid to the 8% remaining Linde AG minority shareholders in exchange for the transfer of their Linde AG shares for each Linde AG share. The cash-merger squeeze-out was approved by the shareholders of Linde AG at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Linde AG on December 12, 2018 and completed on April 8, 2019. The remaining noncontrolling interests relate to the fair value of historic noncontrolling interests of Linde AG and its subsidiaries. Equity InvestmentsThe fair value of equity investments was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Other Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed (excluding Goodwill) Linde utilized the carrying values, net of allowances, to value accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable as well as other current assets and liabilities as it was determined that carrying values represented the fair value of those items at the merger date. GoodwillThe excess of the consideration for the merger over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The merger resulted in the recognition of $24,256 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and cost and other operating synergies anticipated upon the integration of the operations of Praxair and Linde AG. Results of Linde AG Operations in 2018 The results of operations of Linde AG have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of income since the merger.

From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG collectively incurred pre-tax costs of $736 million ($680 million after tax) to prepare for and close the merger. These merger costs were reflected within the results of operations in the pro forma results as if they were incurred on January 1, 2017. Any costs incurred related to merger-related divestitures and integration and to prepare for the intended business separations were reflected in the pro forma results in the period in which they were incurred.The company incurred pre-tax charges of $368 million ( $279 million after tax) and $10 million ($8 million after tax) in 2018 related to the fair value step‑up of inventories acquired and sold as well as a pension settlement due to the payout to certain participants as a result of change in control provisions within a U.S. nonqualified pension plan, respectively. The 2018 pro forma results were adjusted to exclude these charges. The pro forma results for 2017 were adjusted to include these charges, as well as charges incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018 but less than a year from the date of the merger of $13 million ($10 million after tax) related to the remaining fair value step-up of inventories to be sold and $51 million ($40 million after tax) related to an additional pension settlement within the U.S. nonqualified pension plan that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 upon payment.

Classification in the consolidated financial statements The pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded primarily as short-term liabilities. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 20 - Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.89Table of ContentsNOTE 6. LEASESIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Linde determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Total lease and rental expenses related to operating lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $364 million, respectively. Operating leases costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Total lease and rental expenses related to finance lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $31 million, and the costs are included in depreciation and amortization and interest. Related assets and obligations are included in property, plant and equipment - net and debt, respectively. Linde includes renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Operating and financing lease expenses above include short term and variable lease costs which are immaterial.As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, Linde uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Linde determines incremental borrowing rates through market sources. The company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases that meet the short-term lease definition are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance. The company does not have material variable lease payments.Gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial.

Provision for Income TaxesThe following is an analysis of the provision for income taxes: 91Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,2019 (a) 2018 (b) 2017 (c)Current tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal$64 $390 $565State and local39 (7) 84Foreign969 620 374 1,072 1,003 1,023Deferred tax expense (benefit) U.S. federal85 8 (221)State and local— 15 19Foreign(388) (209) 205 (303) (186) 3Total income taxes$769 $817 $1,026 (a)2019 includes $70 million related to divestitures, foreign current tax expense of $48 million and foreign deferred tax expense of $22 million (b)2018 includes a benefit of $61 million related to the Tax Act (See below) and a charge of $371 million ($252 million U.S., $4 million state, $114 million foreign current tax expense and $1 million of U.S. deferred income tax expense) related to divestitures (See Note 4).(c)2017 includes a charge of $394 million related to the Tax Act (See below).U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) 2018 and 2017On December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act""). This comprehensive tax legislation significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company recorded a net provisional income tax charge of $394 million comprising (i) an estimated $467 million U.S. Federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; (ii) an estimated $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated future repatriation of foreign earnings; and (iii) an estimated $333 million deferred tax benefit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the new 21% tax rate. The $467 million U.S. federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings includes $422 million of deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years.In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed its accounting and updated its provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118 resulting in a net reduction to tax expense of $61 million, $41 million U.S. federal and $20 million of state income tax (net of federal tax benefit). This resulted in a deemed repatriation tax payable of $261 million and $291 million and is payable over the remaining six and seven years, respectively of which $235 million and $265 million is classified as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 9). Further, the Tax Act enacted new provisions related to the taxation of foreign earnings, known as GILTI. The company has elected as an accounting policy to account for GILTI as period costs when incurred.Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, ""Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"", electing to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI"") to retained earnings. This resulted in a net reduction to AOCI and a net increase to retained earnings of $93 million, $98 million directly related to the federal income tax rate change reduced by $5 million indirectly related to the federal tax rate change on state income taxes.Effective Tax Rate ReconciliationFor purposes of the effective tax rate reconciliation, the company utilized the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. An analysis of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income follows: 92Table of Contents(Dollar amounts in millions)Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017U.S. statutory income tax$615 21.0 % $1,060 21.0 % $801 35.0 %State and local taxes – net of federal benefit31 1.1 % 30 0.6 % 32 1.4 %U.S. tax credits and deductions (a)(31) (1.1)% (12) (0.2)% (27) (1.2)%Foreign tax differentials (b)113 3.9 % 57 1.1 % (145) (6.3)%Share-Based compensation(41) (1.4)% (22) (0.4)% (35) (1.5)%Tax Act— — % (61) (1.2)% 394 17.2 %Divestitures (c)36 1.2 % (321) (6.4)% — — %Other – net (d)46 1.6 % 86 1.7 % 6 0.3 %Provision for income taxes$769 26.3 % $817 16.2 % $1,026 44.9 % ________________________(a)U.S. tax credits and deductions relate to foreign derived intangible income in 2019 and 2018, the research and experimentation tax credit in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and manufacturing deduction in 2017.(b)Primarily related to differences between the U.S. tax rate (21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017) and the statutory tax rate in the countries where the company operates.

After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances. At December 31, 2019, the company had $441 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $222 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $312 million relating to NOLs of which $55 million expire within 5 years, $115 million expire after 5 years and $142 million have no expiration. The deferred tax assets also include $129 million related to credits of which $6 million expire within 5 years, $113 million expire after 5 years, and $10 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $222 million primarily relate to NOLs and are required because management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the NOLs will be utilized before they expire. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.The company has $664 million of foreign income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2019. A provision has not been made for any additional foreign income tax at December 31, 2019 on approximately $31 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $31 billion could become subject to additional foreign income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary, or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.Uncertain Tax PositionsUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $472 million, $319 million and $54 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 94Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)2019 2018 2017Unrecognized income tax benefits, January 1$319 $54 $56Additions for tax positions of prior years (a)151 104 48Reductions for tax positions of prior years(3) (7) (26)Additions for current year tax positions (b)33 179 —Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (c)(26) (3) (26)Foreign currency translation and other(2) (8) 2Unrecognized income tax benefits, December 31$472 $319 $54 ________________________(a)Increase primarily relates to tax positions in the United States and Europe, $66 million in 2019 related to the merger with Linde AG.(b)2018 includes $167 million related to the merger with Linde AG.(c)Settlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty. The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest expense of $1 million, $32 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The company had $65 million and $48 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 9). 95Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2019, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below: Major tax jurisdictionsOpen YearsNorth and South America United States2016 through 2019Canada2012 through 2019Mexico2013 through 2019Brazil2005 through 2019 Europe and Africa France2014 through 2019Germany2015 through 2019Netherlands2015 through 2019Republic of South Africa2015 through 2019Spain2006 through 2019United Kingdom2015 through 2019 Asia and Australia Australia2014 through 2019China2014 through 2019India2006 through 2019Korea2014 through 2019Taiwan2015 through 2019The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.96Table of ContentsNOTE 8.

For the second quarter 2019 test, Linde applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, Linde concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process. The change in annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The company has determined this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable.Linde's impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 estimated the fair value of each reporting unit by applying multiples of earnings from a peer group to the company’s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. Linde concluded the fair value of reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore recognized no impairment. There were no indicators of impairment through December 31, 2019. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the recent merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.101NOTE 12.

Credit FacilitiesOn March 26, 2019 the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (""the Credit Agreement"") with a syndicate of banking institutions, which became effective on March 29, 2019. The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, Praxair and Linde AG terminated their major respective existing revolving credit facilities. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.On September 3, 2019 Linde and the company’s subsidiaries Praxair and Linde AG entered into a series of parent and subsidiary guarantees related to currently outstanding notes issued by Praxair and Linde AG as well as the $5 billion Credit Agreement.Other Debt InformationAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.6% for both periods. Expected maturities of long-term debt are as follows:(Millions of dollars) 2020$1,53120211,85520222,33020231,7982024983Thereafter3,727 $12,224As of December 31, 2019, the amount of Linde's assets pledged as collateral was immaterial.See Note 15 for the fair value information related to debt.NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency interest rate contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting 105Table of Contentspurposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.Counterparties to Linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes (""CSAs"") in place with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2019, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 for consolidated subsidiaries: Fair Value(Millions of dollars)Notional Amounts Assets (a) Liabilities (a)December 31,2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: Currency contracts: Balance sheet items $7,936 $6,357 $62 $24 $37 $42 Forecasted transactions748 945 14 15 15 17 Cross-currency interest rate swaps1,029 2,110 35 112 40 40Commodity contracts N/A N/A — 27 — 9Total9,7139,412 111178 92 108Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments: Currency contracts: Balance sheet items $27 $— $2 $— $3 $—Forecasted transactions464 158 9 2 3 3Commodity contractsN/A N/A 6 — 1 —Interest rate swaps 1,908 2,164 39 13 — 10Total Hedges$2,399 $2,322 $56 $15 $7 $13Total Derivatives$12,112 $11,734 $167 $193 $99 $121 (a) Current assets of $85 million are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $82 million are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $54 million are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $45 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities. Balance Sheet ItemsForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.Forecasted TransactionsForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are 106Table of Contentsrecorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Interest Rate/Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps Cross-currency interest rate swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond. Commodity Contracts Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. The fair value adjustments for the majority of these contracts are recorded to AOCI and are eventually offset by the income statement impact of the underlying commodity purchase. Net investment hedgesAs of December 31, 2019, Linde has not designated any hedges of net investment positions in foreign operations. Linde had previously designated Euro-denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges to reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments in foreign subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. Exchange rate movements of $206 million relating to the previously denominated Euro-denominated debt incurred in the financial periods prior to de-designation will remain in AOCI, until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. Exchange rate movements related to the Euro-denominated debt occurring after de-designation are shown in the consolidated statements of income.Interest Rate SwapsLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability. The notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps of Linde with maturity dates from 2020 through 2028 was $1,908 million at December 31, 2019 and $2,164 at December 31, 2018 (see Note 13 for further information).Terminated Treasury Rate LocksThe unrecognized aggregate losses related to terminated treasury rate lock contracts on the underlying $500 million 3.00% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2021 and the $500 million 2.20% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2022 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $2 million (net of taxes of $1 million) and $2 million (net of taxes of $1 million), respectively. The unrecognized gains/(losses) for the treasury rate locks are shown in AOCI and are being recognized on a straight line basis to interest expense - net over the term of the underlying debt agreements. Impact of derivative instruments on earnings and AOCIThe following table summarizes the impact of the company's derivatives on the consolidated statements of income:(Millions of dollars) Amount of Pre-Tax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Earnings *December 31,2019 2018 2017Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Currency contracts: Balance sheet items: Debt-related$253 $(118) $121Other balance sheet items65 3 —Total$318 $(115) $121* The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net.107Table of ContentsThe amounts of gain or loss recognized in AOCI and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net losses expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI within foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on treasury rate locks are recorded as a component of AOCI within derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are reclassified to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are required to be reclassified, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. The gains (losses) for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense –net on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the underlying debt.108Table of ContentsNOTE 15. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018: Fair Value Measurements Using(Millions of dollars)Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018Assets Derivative assets$— $— $167 $193 $— $—Investments and securities *18 22 — — 28 30Total$18 $22 $167 $193 $28 $30Liabilities Derivative liabilities$— $— $99 $121 $— $—*Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.The following table summarizes the changes in level 3 investments and securities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gains (losses) recognized in earnings are recorded to interest expense - net in the company's consolidated statements of income.(Millions of dollars)2019Balance at January 1$30Additions1Gains (losses) recognized in earnings(3)Balance at December 31$28The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $12,375 million versus a carrying value of $12,224 million. At December 31, 2018 the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $13,725 million versus a carrying value of $13,811 million. As Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair value as of the merger date, differences between the carrying value and the fair value not significant; remaining differences are attributable to interest rate increases subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.109Table of ContentsNOTE 16. EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTSLinde plc Shareholders’ EquityAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Linde has total authorized share capital of €1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each, 25,000 A ordinary shares of €1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of €0.001 each.At December 31, 2019 there were 552,012,862 and 534,380,544 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2019 there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.At December 31, 2018 there were 551,310,272 and 547,241,630 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2018, there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding. Linde’s Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.2018 Merger of Praxair and Linde AGFollowing is a summary of the Linde plc shareholders' equity transactions related to the merger: Ordinary Shares Additional Paid in Capital Treasury Stock(Dollar amounts in millions, shares in thousands)Shares Amount Shares AmountMerger with Linde AG (a)263,148 $— $43,288 — $—Conversion of Praxair to Linde plc shares (b)— (3) 3 — —Cancellation of Praxair Treasury stock (c)(95,324) — (7,113) (95,324) 7,113 Impact of Linde AG merger167,824 $(3) $36,178 (95,324) $7,113(a)The total fair value of consideration transferred for the merger was $43,288 million, resulting in an increase to ""Additional paid-in capital"" in stockholders' equity (see Note 3 for additional information). (b)On October 31, 2018, the conversion of Praxair common stock and Linde AG common stock into Linde ordinary shares resulted in a $3 million decrease to ""Ordinary Shares"" with a corresponding increase to ""Additional paid-in capital"" in stockholders' equity. (c)Each share of Praxair common stock held in treasury immediately prior to the merger was canceled. The elimination of Praxair's historical treasury stock at cost resulted in a $7,113 million decrease in ""Treasury stock"" and ""Additional paid-in capital"" in stockholders' equity. As indicated above, in connection with the merger, Praxair and Linde AG common stock was converted into shares of Linde plc ordinary shares. The following table provides a summary of the share activity resulting from the merger:(in thousands, except Linde AG exchange ratio)Linde plc shares exchanged for Linde AG shares Linde AG common stock tendered as of October 31, 2018 (i)170,875Business combination agreement exchange ratio (ii)1.54Linde plc ordinary shares issued in exchange for Linde AG263,148Linde plc shares issued to Praxair shareholders upon conversion Praxair shares outstanding at merger date287,907Total Linde plc shares issued at merger date551,055110Table of Contents(i)Number of Linde AG shares tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offer.(ii)Exchange ratio for Linde AG shares as set forth in the business combination agreement.Other Linde plc Ordinary Share and Treasury Stock TransactionsLinde may issue new ordinary shares for dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans and employee savings and incentive plans. The number of new Linde ordinary shares issued from the merger date through December 31, 2019 was 958,293 shares. On December 10, 2018 the Linde board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 6,385,887 shares through December 31, 2019 (4,068,642 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2018). Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2019.Subsequently, on January 22, 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 12,016,083 shares through December 31, 2019.Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. The $2,921 million decrease during 2019 was primarily driven by Linde AG completion of the cash merger squeeze-out of all its minority shares on April 8, 2019. This represents the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out (See Note 3). The $186 million decrease during 2018 primarily relates to the sale of Praxair's industrial gases business in Europe (see Notes 1 and 4). The ""Impact of Merger"" line item of the consolidated statements of equity includes the fair value of the noncontrolling interests acquired from Linde AG, including the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were intended to be the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out (See Note 3).The $15 million increase during 2017 relates to additional funding provided to PG Technologies, LLC (""PGT"") by the joint venture partner.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company’s control (“redeemable noncontrolling interests”) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2019, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes industrial gas businesses in EMEA and Americas where the noncontrolling shareholders have put options. 111Table of ContentsNOTE 17. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONShare-based compensation expense was $95 million in 2019 ($62 million and $59 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $42 million in 2019 ($30 million and $53 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.Summary of Plans The 2009 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan was initially adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. on April 28, 2009 and has been amended since its initial adoption (""the 2009 Plan""). Upon completion of the business combination of Praxair, Inc. with Linde AG on October 31, 2018, the 2009 Plan was assumed by the company. Prior to April 28, 2009, Praxair, Inc. granted equity awards under the 2002 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan , (“the 2002 Plan”) which was also assumed by the company upon completion of the business combination. The 2009 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2019, 6,454,428 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2009 Plan, of which 1,757,354 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.In 2005, the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. adopted the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Praxair, Inc. (""the 2005 Plan""). Upon completion of the business combination in October 2018, the 2005 Plan was also assumed by the company. Under the 2005 Plan, the aggregate number of shares available for option and other equity grants was limited to a total of 500,000 shares. The 2005 Plan expired on April 30, 2010, by its own terms, and no shares were available for grant thereafter.Upon the completion of the business combination, all options outstanding under the 2009 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2005 Plan were converted into options to acquire the same number of shares of the company and at the same exercise price per share that applied prior to the business combination.Exercise prices for options granted under the 2009 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2009 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. Options granted under predecessor plans had similar terms.In connection with the business combination, on October 31, 2018 the company's Board of Directors adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan 2018 of Linde plc (“the LTIP 2018”), the purpose of which is to replace certain outstanding Linde AG equity based awards that were terminated. Under the LTIP 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128. As of December 31, 2019, 260,794 shares remained available for grant, and since the company was obligated to make these replacement awards in 2019, it does not anticipate any further grants under this plan.Exercise prices for the replacement option rights that were granted in 2019 under the LTIP 2018 were equal to EUR 1.67 ($1.92 as converted at an exchange rate from the time the exchange offer was completed as the option rights are exercisable in U.S. dollars on the NYSE) as prescribed in the business combination agreement. Each replacement option right granted under the LTIP 2018 is subject to vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant Linde AG award that had been granted before the business combination. After vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year. In order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares. Stock Option Fair ValueThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option 112Table of Contentsexpense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2019 was $23.38 ($19.29 in 2018 and $12.40 in 2017) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to the increase in the company's stock price. The weighted-average fair value of replacement option rights granted in 2019 was $160.08 based on intrinsic value method.The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2019, 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Dividend yield2.0% 2.1% 2.7%Volatility14.3% 14.4% 14.0%Risk-free interest rate2.38% 2.67% 2.13%Expected term years6 5 6The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2019 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): ActivityNumber ofOptions(000’s) AverageExercisePrice AverageRemainingLife AggregateIntrinsicValueOutstanding at January 1, 201910,624 $117.65 Granted1,486 157.14 Exercised(2,705) 103.87 Cancelled or expired(108) 158.17 Outstanding at December 31, 20199,297 $127.04 6.0 $798Exercisable at December 31, 20196,306 $117.26 5.0 $603The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $212.90 as of December 31, 2019 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2019 was $219 million ($113 million and $137 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively).Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2019 was $64 million ($66 million and $107 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $56 million for 2019 ($30 million and $51 million cash tax benefit in 2018 and 2017, respectively). As of December 31, 2019, $32 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.Performance-Based and Restricted Stock AwardsIn 2019, Linde granted 261,760 performance-based stock awards under the 2009 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital (""ROC"") performance or relative total shareholder return (""TSR"") performance versus that of the S&P 500 (weighted 67%) and Eurofirst 300 (weighted 33%). The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2019 was $168.47, and during 2017 was $109.68. These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. There were no ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2018.113Table of ContentsThe weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2019 was $215.85, and during 2017 was $124.12, and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. There were no performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2018.Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding ROC and TSR performance-based award granted prior to 2018 was converted into a Linde RSU based on performance achieved as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and became subject to service-vesting conditions only. This resulted in the conversion of 435,000 performance-based shares into 704,000 restricted stock units. Compensation expense related to these awards will continue to be recognized over the remainder of the respective three-year service period. There were 161,072 restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2019. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2019 was $165.04 ($144.86 in 2018 and $111.95 in 2017). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.The following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of December 31, 2019 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): Performance-Based Restricted Stock Number ofShares(000’s) AverageGrant DateFair Value Number ofShares(000’s) AverageGrant DateFair ValueNon-vested at January 1, 2019— $— 1,071 $118.84Granted262 184.29 161 165.04Vested— — (330) 107.10Cancelled and Forfeited(16) 184.26 (18) 146.32Non-vested at December 31, 2019246 $184.29 884 $129.43 There are approximately 7 thousand performance-based shares and 11 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at December 31, 2019 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current share price. As of December 31, 2019, $23 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards and $21 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2022.NOTE 18. RETIREMENT PROGRAMSDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.Linde has two main U.S. retirement programs which are non-contributory defined benefit plans: the Linde U.S. Pension Plan and the CBI Pension Plan. The latter program benefits primarily former employees of CBI Industries, Inc. which Linde acquired in 1996. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time choice to remain covered by the old formula or to elect coverage under a new formula. The old formula is based predominantly on years of service, age and compensation levels prior to retirement, while the new formula provides for an annual contribution to an individual account which grows with interest each year at a predetermined rate. Also, this new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. and international pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including domestic and international corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde’s international subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.Defined Benefit Pension Plans - InternationalLinde has international, defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. Multi-employer Pension PlansIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (""MEPs""), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2026. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. Linde’s contributions to these plans were $2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2018 and 2017. Total 2019 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.Linde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (""PPA"") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. The PPA classifies MEPs as either Red, Yellow or Green Zone plans. Among other factors, plans in the Red Zone are generally less than 65 percent funded with a projected insolvency date within the next twenty years; plans in the Yellow Zone are generally 65 to 80 percent funded; and plans in the Green Zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. Red Zone plans are considered to be in ""critical"" or ""critical and declining"" status, while Yellow Zone plans are considered to be in ""endangered"" status. Plans that are in neither ""critical"" nor ""endangered"" status are considered to have Green Zone status. According to the most recent data available, four of the MEPs that the company participates in are in a Red Zone status and four are in a Green Zone status. As of December 31, 2019, the four Red Zone plans have pending or have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.Defined Contribution PlansLinde’s U.S. business employees are eligible to participate in the Linde defined contribution savings plan. Employees may contribute up to 40% of their compensation, subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations. For the U.S. packaged gases business, company contributions to this plan are calculated as a percentage of salary based on age plus service. U.S. employees other than those in the packaged gases business have company contributions to this plan calculated on a graduated scale based on employee contributions to the plan. The cost for these defined contribution plans was $47 million in 2019, $33 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (""ESOP"") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 2,070,100 at December 31, 2019.Certain international subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $95 million in 2019, $32 million in 2018 and $21 million in 2017 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow). Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.Pension and Postretirement Benefit CostsThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (""OPEB"") costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the table below (2018 reflects the impact of the Linde AG merger on October 31, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 3) and the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business on December 3, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 4)): (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions OPEB2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017Amount recognized in Operating Profit Service cost$142 $74 $46 $2 $2 $3Amount recognized in Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost Interest cost261 128 103 7 5 5 Expected return on plan assets(462) (219) (161) — — — Net amortization and deferral61 71 68 (4) (3) (3) Curtailment and termination benefits (a)8 — — — — (18) Settlement charges (b)97 14 2 — — — $(35) $(6) $12 $3 $2 $(16)Amount recognized in Net gain on sale of businesses Settlement gains from divestitures (c)— (44) — — — —Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)$107 $24 $58 $5 $4 $(13)(a) In 2019, Linde recorded curtailment gains of $9 million and a charge of $17 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. The curtailment gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the termination of an OPEB plan in South America in the first quarter. (b) In the third and fourth quarters of 2019, Linde recorded pension settlement charges of $40 million and $6 million, respectively, related to lump sum payments made from a U.S. qualified plan. These payments were triggered by merger-related divestitures. In the first quarter of 2019, benefits of $91 million were paid related to the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. Such benefits were triggered by a change in control provision and resulted in a settlement charge of $51 million. 2018 includes the impact of a $4 million charge and a $10 million charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. In the third quarter, a series of lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan triggered a settlement of the related pension obligation. In the fourth quarter, a change in control provision triggered the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. 2017 includes the impact of a $2 million charge related to a series of lump sum benefit payments for employees under an international pension plan. (c) In connection with Praxair merger-related divestitures, primarily the European industrial gases business, certain European pension plan obligations were settled. This resulted in the recognition of associated pension benefit obligations and deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within operating profit in the ""Net gain on sale of businesses"" line item. 114Table of ContentsFunded StatusChanges in the benefit obligation and plan assets for Linde’s pension and OPEB programs, including reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown below. 115Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions 2019 2018 OPEBU.S. International U.S. International 2019 2018Change in Benefit Obligation (""PBO"") Benefit obligation, January 1$2,508 $7,533 $2,215 $725 $184 $146Merger impact (a)— — 415 6,920 — 53Service cost38 104 42 32 2 2Interest cost81 180 74 54 7 5Divestitures (b)(1) — — (106) — —Participant contributions— 20 — 4 8 9Plan amendment— 13 — 1 — —Actuarial loss (gain)266 1,045 (100) 7 8 (11)Benefits paid(105) (333) (111) (84) (20) (19)Plan settlement(235) — (27) — — —Plan curtailment— (9) — — 2 —Foreign currency translation and other changes— 136 — (20) 1 (1)Benefit obligation, December 31$2,552 $8,689 $2,508 $7,533 $192 $184Accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"")$2,464 $8,553 $2,428 $7,385 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, January 1$1,952 $6,292 $1,655 $567 $— $—Merger impact (a)— — 475 5,880 — —Actual return on plan assets341 598 (72) (88) — —Company contributions— 94 — 75 — —Benefits paid from plan assets(244) (268) (106) (69) — —Divestitures (b)(1) — — (49) — —Foreign currency translation and other changes— 172 — (24) — —Fair value of plan assets, December 31$2,048 $6,888 $1,952 $6,292 $— $—Funded Status, End of Year$(504) $(1,801) $(556) $(1,241) $(192) $(184)Recorded in the Balance Sheet (Note 9) Other long-term assets$— $78 $47 $93 $— $—Other current liabilities(6) (10) (94) (10) (11) (13)Other long-term liabilities(498) (1,869) (509) (1,324) (181) (171)Net amount recognized, December 31$(504) $(1,801) $(556) $(1,241) $(192) $(184)Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of: Net actuarial loss (gain)$753 $1,110 $834 $339 $(10) $(23)Prior service cost (credit)— 4 — 10 (4) (5)Deferred tax benefit (Note 7)(190) (251) (212) (87) (5) 7Amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (Note 9)$563 $863 $622 $262 $(19) $(21)116Table of Contents(a) Represents Linde AG plan assets and benefit obligations assumed as part of the merger.

In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impacts of unfavorable liability experience, resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience. Pension net actuarial losses in 2018 are driven by lower U.S. discount rates, which more than offset favorable plan asset experience. OPEB net actuarial losses in 2019 relate to the low interest rate environment, which was partially offset by favorable actual benefit payment experience. Net actuarial gains in 2018 relate to the benefits from higher U.S. discount rates and favorable actual participant experience.The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2020 are as follows:(Millions of dollars)Pension OPEBNet actuarial loss (gain)$88 $(2)Prior service cost (credit)2 (1) $90 $(3)117Table of ContentsThe following table provides information for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31,Pensions2019 2018U.S. International U.S. InternationalProjected benefit obligation (""PBO"")$2,552 $7,768 $2,139 $6,681Accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"")$2,464 $7,664 $2,060 $6,586Fair value of plan assets$2,048 $5,849 $1,482 $5,307AssumptionsThe assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as of the respective balance sheet dates and the assumptions used to determine net benefit cost are as of the previous year-end, as shown below: Pensions U.S. International OPEB 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, Discount rate3.20% 4.20% 1.91% 2.72% 3.19% 4.16%Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.25% 3.25% 2.46% 2.38% N/A N/AWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31, Discount rate 4.20% 3.73% 2.72% 2.73% 4.16% 3.81%Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.25% 3.25% 2.38% 2.45% N/A N/AExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets (1)7.27% 7.62% 5.15% 5.13% N/A N/A________________________(1)The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.118Table of Contents OPEBAssumed healthcare cost trend rates2019 2018Historical Praxair, Inc. plans Healthcare cost trend assumed7.00% 6.25%Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)5.00% 5.00%Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate2027 2023Historical Linde AG plans Healthcare cost trend assumed 5.49% 5.49%Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)4.50% 4.50%Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate2038 2038These healthcare cost trend rate assumptions have an impact on the amounts reported.

Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The international pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Linde’s U.S. and international pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the target asset allocation range for 2019, by major asset category, are as follows: U.S. InternationalAsset CategoryTarget 2019 Target 2018 2019 2018 Target 2019 Target 2018 2019 2018Equity securities40%-60% 40%-60% 55% 48% 15%-25% 15%-25% 23% 20%Fixed income securities30%-50% 30%-50% 30% 40% 30%-50% 30%-50% 41% 46%Other5%-15% 5%-15% 15% 13% 30%-50% 30%-40% 36% 34% 119Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Equity Securities – This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual Funds – These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. U.S. and International Government Bonds – This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and international government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Corporate Bonds – This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and international corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.Pooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities. Bank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Liquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using observable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Insurance Contracts – The fair value of insurance contracts is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Real Estate Funds – This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Private Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. ContributionsAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $94 million in 2019, $87 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2017. Estimated required contributions for 2020 are currently expected to be in the range of $50 million to $80 million. 121Table of ContentsEstimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments, net of participant contributions: (Millions of dollars)Pensions Year Ended December 31,U.S. International OPEB 2020$187 $311 $152021143 323 142022164 335 142023147 342 142024149 352 122025-2029760 879 55 122Table of ContentsNOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company’s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).Contingent LiabilitiesLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.Significant matters are:•During May 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During the 2009 third quarter, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.•At December 31, 2019 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $260 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. •On September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$2.2 billion Brazilian reais ($546 million) on White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. The fine was reduced to R$1.7 billion Brazilian reais ($422 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. On September 14, 2015, the fine against White Martins was overturned by the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision on June 30, 2016.Similarly, on September 1, 2010, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$237 million Brazilian reais ($59 million) on Linde Gases Ltda., the former Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde AG, which was divested to MG Industries GmbH on March 1, 2019 and with respect to which Linde provided a contractual indemnity. The fine was reduced to R$188 million Brazilian reais ($47 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. On May 6, 2014 the fine against Linde Gases Ltda. was overturned by the Seventh Federal Court in Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision on October 27, 2016.Linde has strong defenses and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fines overturned. Linde strongly believes that the allegations of anticompetitive activity against our current and former Brazilian subsidiaries are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence. Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserves have been recorded as management does not believe that a loss from this case is probable. 123Table of Contents•On and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (Landgericht) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG’s minority shareholders for €189.46 per share. Any such increase would apply to all 14,763,113 Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims lack merit, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.CommitmentsAt December 31, 2019, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $3,276 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including foreign litigation matters.Other commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 6, 7, 13, and 18).124Table of ContentsNOTE 20. SEGMENT INFORMATIONEffective October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG completed the previously announced merger, resulting in the formation of Linde plc (see Note 1 for additional information on the merger). As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order effective on March 1, 2019, new operating segments were created which are used by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") to allocate company resources and assess performance. Linde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's new reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation. The industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.The company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes remains unchanged - Segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. Similarly, total assets have not been included as this is not provided to the CODM for their assessment. For a description of Linde's previous operating segments, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of Linde's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting (See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The historical periods prior to 2018 reflect the results of Praxair.

REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.Contracts with CustomersApproximately 83% of Linde's consolidated sales are generated from industrial gases and related products in three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA, and APAC) and the remaining 17% is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 20 for operating segment details). Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. Industrial GasesWithin each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.Following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies: On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.Merchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.128Table of ContentsThe company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. Linde Engineering The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $368 million at December 31, 2019. Total contract liabilities are $2,106 million at December 31, 2019 (current of $1,758 million and $348 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Total contract liabilities were $1,934 million at December 31, 2018 (current contract liabilities of $1,546 million, $234 million classified as deferred income within other current liabilities and $154 million in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2018 was $1,168 million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business acquired in the merger. The industrial gases business does not typically have material contract assets or liabilities.Payment Terms and OtherLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.Disaggregated Revenue InformationAs described above and in Note 20, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing. The following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date),129Table of Contents(Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2019SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal% Merchant$2,946$1,856$2,080$—$184$7,06625%On-Site2,7581,4342,060——6,25222%Packaged Gas5,1853,3471,562—1910,11336%Other10461372,7991,7514,79717% $10,993$6,643$5,839$2,799$1,954$28,228100% (Millions of dollars)Year Ended December 31, 2018SalesAmericasEMEAAPACEngineeringOtherTotal% Merchant$2,775$832$826$—$119$4,55231%On-Site2,4055361,156——4,09728%Packaged Gas2,8001,271443—34,51730%Other375214591,1481,67011% $8,017$2,644$2,446$459$1,270$14,836100%Remaining Performance ObligationsAs described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. The company estimates the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $48 billion. This amount excludes all sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity.
