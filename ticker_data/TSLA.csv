1318605,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2019-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2021. Overview and 2021 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2021, we produced 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2021, we deployed 3.99 GWh of energy storage products and 345 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems. In 2021, we recognized total revenues of $53.82 billion, representing a 71% increase compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. In 2021, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $5.52 billion, representing a favorable change of $4.80 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended 2021 with $17.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents, representing a decrease of $1.81 billion from the end of 2020. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 was $11.50 billion, representing an increase of $5.55 billion compared to $5.94 billion during 2020, and capital expenditures amounted to $6.48 billion during 2021, compared to $3.16 billion during 2020. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, but we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2022 Outlook Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply. We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments, and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. Ultimately, we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. 31 Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin Model Y Equipment test Gigafactory Texas Model Y Equipment test Cybertruck In development TBD Tesla Semi In development TBD Tesla Roadster In development We are focused on ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing capacity at our current factories. Our current production continues to be affected by the industry-wide semiconductor and other component shortages, requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain. Builds of Model Y in Gigafactory Texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in Gigafactory Berlin started in late 2021. The next phase of production growth will depend on the testing and ramp at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories, we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability. However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. In addition to ramping production in 2022, we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally, as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade, environmental and political uncertainty, all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our deliveries increase, we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. 32 Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing cross-selling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “in-the-money” convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. 33 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. 34 Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 35 Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2021, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. 36 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Automotive sales $ 44,125 $ 24,604 $ 19,358 $ 19,521 79 % $ 5,246 27 % Automotive regulatory credits 1,465 1,580 594 (115 ) -7 % 986 166 % Automotive leasing 1,642 1,052 869 590 56 % 183 21 % Total automotive revenues 47,232 27,236 20,821 19,996 73 % 6,415 31 % Services and other 3,802 2,306 2,226 1,496 65 % 80 4 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 51,034 29,542 23,047 21,492 73 % 6,495 28 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 2,789 1,994 1,531 795 40 % 463 30 % Total revenues $ 53,823 $ 31,536 $ 24,578 $ 22,287 71 % $ 6,958 28 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. 2021 compared to 2020 Automotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions. Automotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined. Services and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 37 2021 compared to 2020 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $795 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack, solar cash and loan jobs, Powerwall and Solar Roof, partially offset by a decrease in Powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack.

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 2021 compared to 2020 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $12.72 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. Additionally, the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of $286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of Model S and Model X. Additionally, there was a decrease in combined average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity, where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in China. 38 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $415 million, or 74%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cost of automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined. Cost of services and other revenue increased $1.24 billion, or 46%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of non-Tesla used vehicles, costs to support our increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue and costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased. Gross margin for total automotive increased from 25.6% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of Model 3 and Model Y as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity. The average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit have decreased significantly due to localized procurement and manufacturing in China despite rising raw material, commodity, logistics and expedite costs. Additionally, our Model Y gross margin has benefitted from shared manufacturing of Model 3 and learnings from the scaling of past products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $115 million in sales of regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment increased from 22.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 26.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, there was a lower proportion of services and other, which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business, within the segment in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2021 compared to 2020 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $942 million, or 48%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in deployments of Solar Roof, solar cash and loan jobs, Megapack and Powerwall, partially offset by reductions in average costs per unit of Solar Roof as deployments have increased and a decrease in Powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack. Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 0.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to -4.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in our overall energy business which operated at a lower gross margin as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp despite an improvement in gross margin compared to the prior year and lower Powerpack gross margin as fixed cost absorptions are negatively impacted as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack. These decreases were partially offset by a higher proportion of Powerwall in our overall energy business which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an increase in Megapack gross margin as we continue to scale the products. Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Research and development $ 2,593 $ 1,491 $ 1,343 $ 1,102 74 % $ 148 11 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 5 % 5 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. 39 R&D expenses increased $1.10 billion, or 74%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $506 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to an increase in headcount, a $263 million increase in R&D expensed materials, a $211 million increase in facilities, outside services, freight and depreciation expense and an $103 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap such as the new versions of Model S and Model X and technologies including our proprietary battery cells and there were additional R&D expenses as we were in the pre-production phases at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin in the current year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 5% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. R&D expenses increased proportionately with the increase in total revenues from expanding sales. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,517 $ 3,145 $ 2,646 $ 1,372 44 % $ 499 19 % As a percentage of revenues 8 % 10 % 11 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses increased $1.37 billion, or 44%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $568 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and increased payroll taxes due to our higher average share price in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, a $319 million increase in office, information technology, facilities-related expenses, sales and marketing activities and other costs and an increase of $145 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $72 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. See Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 8% in the year ended December 31, 2021. Our SG&A expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to operational efficiencies. Restructuring and Other Expense Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ (27 ) $ — $ 149 $ (27 ) Not meaningful $ (149 ) -100 % As a percentage of revenues 0 % 0 % 1 % During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $101 million of impairment losses on bitcoin.

See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 40 Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Other income (expense), net $ 135 $ (122 ) $ 45 $ 257 Not meaningful $ (167 ) Not meaningful As a percentage of revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Other income (expense), net, changed favorably by $257 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a $49 million favorable change in the mark-to-market remeasurement of our interest rate swaps. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 699 $ 292 $ 110 $ 407 139 % $ 182 165 % Effective tax rate 11 % 25 % -17 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $407 million, or 139%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increases in taxable profits within our foreign jurisdictions year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 25% to 11% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in pre-tax income and changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. See Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Change 2020 vs. 2019 Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 $ % $ % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ 125 $ 141 $ 87 $ (16 ) -11 % $ 54 62 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by $16 million, or 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the construction and ramp of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2021, as well as in the long-term. 41 See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2022 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021 and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $5.38 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.09 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, our total minimum lease payments are $4.03 billion, of which $1.04 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. As of December 31, 2021, we had $17.58 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $7.22 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollars. In addition, we had $1.11 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2021. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets). For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other marketable securities, digital assets and providing product related financing. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. The fair market value of our bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2021 was $1.99 billion. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the times when we may want or need to liquidate them. Additionally, we held short-term marketable securities of $131 million as of December 31, 2021. 42 Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,497 $ 5,943 $ 2,405 Net cash used in investing activities $ (7,868 ) $ (3,132 ) $ (1,436 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (5,203 ) $ 9,973 $ 1,529 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.55 billion to $11.50 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 from $5.94 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $5.22 billion and the overall decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $334 million. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by larger increases of inventory and operating lease vehicles compared to the prior year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly for the construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin and the expansions of Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. Additionally, net cash outflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets for $1.50 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash outflows from financing activities were $5.20 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.97 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to no equity offerings in 2021 compared to $12.27 billion of proceeds from issuances of common stock net of issuance costs in 2020, a $3.37 billion increase in net repayments of convertible and other debt compared to the prior year, offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances of $290 million and a decrease in collateralized lease repayments of $231 million compared to the prior year. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). 43 We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $277 million at December 31, 2021 and $8 million at December 31, 2020 assuming no foreign currency hedging. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by $2 million and $4 million, respectively. 44",2023-12-31 03:12:57.416284

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2021-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2022. Overview and 2022 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems. In 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. In 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion from the end of 2021. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $3.23 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to $6.48 billion during 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Tooling Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production TBD Tesla Roadster In development TBD Robotaxi & Others In development 32 We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability. However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi in December 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry in general experienced part shortages and supplier disruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehicle pricing. As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments. Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the year. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the production launch at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 33 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to continue to grow in 2023 as we are expanding our operations globally. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 34 Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. 35 Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. 36 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Automotive sales $ 67,210 $ 44,125 $ 24,604 $ 23,085 52 % $ 19,521 79 % Automotive regulatory credits 1,776 1,465 1,580 311 21 % (115 ) (7 )% Automotive leasing 2,476 1,642 1,052 834 51 % 590 56 % Total automotive revenues 71,462 47,232 27,236 24,230 51 % 19,996 73 % Services and other 6,091 3,802 2,306 2,289 60 % 1,496 65 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 77,553 51,034 29,542 26,519 52 % 21,492 73 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 3,909 2,789 1,994 1,120 40 % 795 40 % Total revenues $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 31,536 $ 27,639 51 % $ 22,287 71 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue. 2022 compared to 2021 Automotive sales revenue increased $23.09 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 347,024 Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, and an increase of 38,183 Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in 2022, at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. There was also an increase in production of Model S and Model X and an increase in the combined average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher proportion of Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized $324 million in revenue related to the general FSD feature release in North America. Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $311 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had only an immaterial increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue. Automotive leasing revenue increased $834 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in activities under our direct operating lease program as well as an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue. Services and other revenue increased $2.29 billion, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue. 37 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, financing of solar energy generation products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 2022 compared to 2021 Energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.12 billion, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in energy storage deployments of Megapack, Powerwall and higher average selling price of Megapack, as well as on solar cash and loan deployments driven by price increases in 2022. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 49,599 $ 32,415 $ 19,696 $ 17,184 53 % $ 12,719 65 % Automotive leasing 1,509 978 563 531 54 % 415 74 % Total automotive cost of revenues 51,108 33,393 20,259 17,715 53 % 13,134 65 % Services and other 5,880 3,906 2,671 1,974 51 % 1,235 46 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 56,988 37,299 22,930 19,689 53 % 14,369 63 % Energy generation and storage segment 3,621 2,918 1,976 703 24 % 942 48 % Total cost of revenues $ 60,609 $ 40,217 $ 24,906 $ 20,392 51 % $ 15,311 61 % Gross profit total automotive $ 20,354 $ 13,839 $ 6,977 Gross margin total automotive 28.5 % 29.3 % 25.6 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 20,565 $ 13,735 $ 6,612 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 26.5 % 26.9 % 22.4 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 288 $ (129 ) $ 18 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 7.4 % (4.6 )% 0.9 % Total gross profit $ 20,853 $ 13,606 $ 6,630 Total gross margin 25.6 % 25.3 % 21.0 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our free Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. 38 2022 compared to 2021 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $17.18 billion, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, in line with the growth in revenue year over year, as discussed above. The average combined cost per unit of Model 3 and Model Y increased year over year due to rising raw material, logistics and warranty costs. There were also idle capacity charges of $306 million primarily related to the temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory Shanghai as well as the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the year ended December 31, 2022. We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in combined average Model S and Model X costs per unit driven by lower average cost for the new versions from ramping up production. Further, these increases in costs of revenue were positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $531 million, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more activities in the current year. Cost of services and other revenue increased $1.97 billion, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in non-warranty maintenance service revenue, and an increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 29.3% to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue, partially offset by an increase in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed earlier. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.9% to 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the year ended 2022 as compared to the prior year. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2022 compared to 2021 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $703 million, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in energy storage deployments of Megapack and Powerwall, as well as higher average cost of solar cash and loan deployments due to increased component costs. Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from -4.6% to 7.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment. 39 Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Research and development $ 3,075 $ 2,593 $ 1,491 $ 482 19 % $ 1,102 74 % As a percentage of revenues 4 % 5 % 5 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses increased $482 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $175 million increase in employee and labor related expenses, a $132 million increase in facilities, outside services, freight and depreciation expense, a $101 million increase in R&D expensed materials and an $87 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap and technologies including our proprietary battery cells. Further, there were additional R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2022 as we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg only closer to the end of the first quarter of 2022. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5% to 4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our R&D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product roadmap and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,946 $ 4,517 $ 3,145 $ (571 ) (13 )% $ 1,372 44 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 8 % 10 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses decreased $571 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to a decrease of $822 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $844 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This was partially offset by the overall growth in stock-based compensation due to increased headcount. See Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There was also a decrease of $87 million in overall employee and labor related expenses driven by a decrease of $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award in 2021, partially offset by an increase in other employee and labor costs from increased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $222 million in facilities-related expenses, and an increase of $117 million in professional services, sales and marketing activities and other costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 8% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our SG&A expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to the decrease in expenses as discussed above, in addition to operational efficiencies. Restructuring and Other Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ 176 $ (27 ) $ — $ 203 Not meaningful $ (27 ) Not meaningful During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $204 million and $101 million, respectively, of impairment losses on digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also realized gains of $64 million and $128 million, respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Additionally, we recorded other expenses of $36 million during the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, related to employee terminations. 40 Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Interest income $ 297 $ 56 $ 30 $ 241 430 % $ 26 87 % Interest income increased $241 million, or 430%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments during the year ended 2022 compared to the prior period. This was driven by an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance and rising interest rates. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (191 ) $ (371 ) $ (748 ) $ 180 (49 )% $ 377 (50 )% Interest expense decreased $180 million, or 49%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the continued reduction in our overall debt balance offset by lower capitalized interest. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Other (Expense) Income, Net Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Other (expense) income, net $ (43 ) $ 135 $ (122 ) $ (178 ) Not meaningful $ 257 Not meaningful Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $178 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 1,132 $ 699 $ 292 $ 433 62 % $ 407 139 % Effective tax rate 8 % 11 % 25 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $433 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increase in our pre-tax income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 11% to 8% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. See Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ 31 $ 125 $ 141 $ (94 ) (75 )% $ (16 ) (11 )% 41 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by $94 million, or 75%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. These changes were due to a decrease in allocations to financing fund investors. Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2022, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.02 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, our total minimum lease payments was $4.28 billion, of which $1.14 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. 42 As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.25 billion and $5.93 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.42 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and British pounds. In addition, we had $2.42 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, which included $2.27 billion under our Credit Agreement which was terminated in January 2023. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets). In January 2023, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for a commitment of up to $5.0 billion. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,724 $ 11,497 $ 5,943 Net cash used in investing activities $ (11,973 ) $ (7,868 ) $ (3,132 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (3,527 ) $ (5,203 ) $ 9,973 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.23 billion to $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11.50 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $7.65 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.43 billion. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, to support the ramp up in production at our factories and larger increases in other non-current assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the increase in our net operating assets and other liabilities was partially offset by a larger increase in other long-term liabilities as compared to the prior year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly for the expansions of Gigafactory Texas, the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai. We also purchased $5.84 billion of investments in the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, cash inflows related to sales of digital assets were $936 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and net cash outflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets for $1.50 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.68 billion to $3.53 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $5.20 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.92 billion decrease in repayments of convertible and other debt, net of proceeds from issuances of debt. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $473 million at December 31, 2022 and $277 million at December 31, 2021, assuming no foreign currency hedging. 44",2023-12-31 03:12:56.455116

We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Overview and 2010 Highlights We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network, and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet, in-person at our corporate events and through our network of Tesla stores. We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003, opened our first store in Los Angeles, California in May 2008, and introduced our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. In July 2009, we introduced a new Roadster model, the Tesla Roadster 2, and its higher performance option package Roadster Sport, as well as launched the Tesla Roadster in Europe. On July 1, 2010, we introduced the Roadster 2.5, with new styling and an upgraded interior. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we experienced solid performance from sales of the Tesla Roadster, especially considering that the automotive sales recognized in 2009 were driven primarily from the fulfillment of a significant reservations list that had accumulated prior to and through 2009. Our automotive sales revenues in 2010 were primarily driven by retail store expansion globally and higher sales and marketing activities, higher average selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers, as well as higher average selling prices outside of the United States. During 2010, we continued to expand our presence in Europe and introduced the Tesla Roadster in Canada and in Asia. Our network of stores increased to 16 stores by the end of 2010 and as of December 31, 2010, we had sold over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, with sales volume being concentrated in the United States and in Europe. In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster and during the latter half of 2010, we began offering a leasing alternative in Canada. Under our program, we permit qualifying customers to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual leases. Lease revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $0.8 million and are recorded as part of our automotive sales revenue. Approximately 14% of the Tesla Roadsters delivered during 2010 were under operating leases. We continued to expand our electric powertrain component and development activities with other automotive manufacturers. By the end of 2009, we had completed the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler AG’s (Daimler) Smart fortwo electric drive and were selected by Daimler to supply it initially with 77 Table of Contents up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in at least five European cities. In 2010, we made significant deliveries of the Smart fortwo battery packs and chargers to Daimler which contributed approximately $21 million to our automotive sales revenue. Since 2009, Daimler has increased its orders under this program, with the current total order at 1,800 battery packs and chargers. Production of the battery packs and chargers is expected to continue through mid-2011. During the year, Daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. A formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with Daimler in May 2010 and upon completion of the A-Class battery pack and charger in October, we started recognizing revenue from the delivery of production battery packs and chargers for the Daimler A-Class program, which we expect to continue through the balance of 2011. In May 2010, we and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, and for us to receive Toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the Model S. In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into an early Phase 0 agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. With an aim by Toyota to market the electric vehicle in the United States in 2012, prototypes would be made by combining the Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. We began developing and delivering prototypes to Toyota for evaluation during the latter half of the year. In connection with this program, in October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant to our agreements, Toyota will pay us up to $69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance. We expect to achieve our deliverables through late 2011 or early 2012. As a result of solid sales of the Tesla Roadster, as well as increased powertrain component sales and the commencement of development services revenues from both Daimler and Toyota, total revenues for 2010 were $116.7 million, an increase over total revenues of $111.9 million in 2009. We are designing our second vehicle, the planned Model S, for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster and plan to manufacture the Model S in higher volumes than our current volumes for the Tesla Roadster. Model S development progressed well during 2010, culminating in the completion of our first drivable alpha prototype in December. Expenses related to the Model S alpha prototype build, increased production and engineering headcount and other important engineering, design and testing work being undertaken at several of our suppliers to support Model S readiness, contributed to the $73.7 million increase in research and development expenses from 2009 to $93.0 million in 2010. Alongside Model S engineering and manufacturing engineering development, we also completed the purchase of our Fremont manufacturing facility in October, which we intend to use for the production of our planned Model S and future vehicles. In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility in Fremont, California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), which is a joint venture between Toyota and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected assets of General Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land. The purchase totals 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits for additional consideration. The aggregate purchase price that we paid to NUMMI was $48.5 million, including the operating permits. In August 2010, we entered into an additional purchase agreement with NUMMI for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the Fremont facility. This purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include additional manufacturing equipment and spare parts and in October 2010, we completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase. The aggregate purchase price that we paid for these assets was $16.7 million. The purchase of the Fremont manufacturing facility and assets, 78 Table of Contents along with other Model S related investments and investments that we made at our Palo Alto, California corporate headquarters and powertrain facility, brought our capital expenditures up to $105.4 million in 2010 from $11.9 million for 2009. We completed several significant financing transactions in 2010 to help progress our Model S and powertrain development activities, as well as support our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure: • In January 2010, we entered into our Department of Energy Loan Facility (DOE Loan Facility) for $465.0 million to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations, subject to certain draw conditions. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million is available under the first term loan facility to finance the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 91.5% of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for our Model S sedan. • In July 2010, we closed our initial public offering (IPO) pursuant to which we sold 11,880,600 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of $188.8 million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. Additionally, we incurred offering costs of $4.4 million related to the IPO. Concurrent with the closing of our IPO, we sold 2,941,176 shares of our common stock to Toyota and received proceeds of $50.0 million. • In November 2010, we sold 1,418,573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for aggregate proceeds of $30.0 million. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks—2011 Outlook Our focus for 2011 continues to be on the disciplined development and preparation for the launch of the planned Model S in mid-2012, as well as the continued growth of revenues through sales of the Tesla Roadster and our powertrain sales and development activities with our strategic partners. We expect sales of the Tesla Roadster to grow over 2010, but expect some seasonality during the winter months. We have a supply agreement with Lotus to purchase a minimum of 2,400 Tesla Roadster vehicles or gliders. Through December 31, 2010, we have delivered over 1,500 vehicles. We currently intend to manufacture the majority of our gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012, and we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in 2012. To the extent we wish to sell additional Tesla Roadsters with the Lotus gliders beyond the number of vehicles we have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with Lotus but may be unable to do so on terms and conditions favorable to us, if at all. We do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model S and we intend to perform such manufacturing entirely in our own facilities. Continued difficult economic conditions, competition from third parties and the planned availability of the Model S in 2012 could result in depressed sales of the Tesla Roadster in 2011. We expect to continue to experience seasonality for sales of the Tesla Roadster. We also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of Model S reservations during the second half of 2011 as we work towards the launch of our planned Model S in mid-2012. As a result of our expanded electric powertrain supply and development services activities with our strategic partners in 2010, we will have significant deliveries and milestones to achieve in 2011. Along with the supply of battery packs and chargers for Daimler’s Smart fortwo EV and A-Class programs, we will also have important development milestones and prototypes to deliver to Toyota as part of our Toyota RAV4 agreements. Although our current agreements with Daimler and Toyota provide us with increased revenue potential in 2011 from powertrain-related activities, we do not yet have finalized any agreements with Daimler or Toyota for significant sales or services beyond 2011. 79 Table of Contents Model S development will continue to be a primary focus for 2011. Ensuring that our engineering, operations and manufacturing engineering teams execute on all significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of our Model S in mid-2012. Our progress towards our beta prototype activities as well as readiness of our manufacturing capabilities, will influence our ability to achieve the manufacturing cost per unit that we are currently projecting. In 2011, we publicly announced the Tesla Model X as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We are designing the Model X as a crossover vehicle. We intend to develop a prototype of the Model X by the end of 2011. The acceleration of the development of future vehicles, including the Tesla Model X, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Our operating expenses are expected to increase in 2011 as we continue to execute on the Model S program, systematically and strategically expand our sales and marketing activities globally to support the launch of the Model S, as well as to maintain and support the overall activities of a growing public company. As we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch the Model S, we expect to continue generating a net loss despite anticipated growth in revenues and improvements in margin. Cost control within our operations, especially in general and administrative, continues to be an important objective. Capital spending for the Model S program is anticipated to be at its highest level in 2011, as we plan to purchase much of the tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production. Inclusive of non-Model S related investments, aggregate capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $215 million. The majority of these capital investments should be reimbursable under the terms of our DOE Loan Facility. With this level of capital spending, we can execute on our strategic decision to increase in-sourcing, primarily in stampings and plastics. We have also elected to invest incrementally in new technologies, primarily in our paint and body shops, to produce vehicles at a higher quality at an affordable cost. Furthermore, we are investing in additional plant automation which provides us with the flexibility to expand capacity to produce up to 20,000 units on just one shift. This investment would have a relatively short payback in terms of saved labor and overhead costs. Additionally, plant automation will allow us to accommodate either higher Model S production or the efficient introduction of future models. As significant capital investment is required to bring our Fremont facility and Model S manufacturing assets to a state of production readiness, all depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the Fremont facility will begin with the start of Model S production. Unadjusted Error in 2009 In June 2010, we identified an error related to the understatement in stock-based compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested. We erroneously accounted for the expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the award, while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period. As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 were understated by $2.7 million. The error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options. As stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item, there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009. To correct this error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of $2.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2010. We considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in 80 Table of Contents operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended June 30, 2010. We also evaluated this control deficiency in the context of our internal control over financial reporting and based on the magnitude, nature and extent of the error, determined that such deficiency would be considered a significant deficiency. A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the company’s financial reporting. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales We recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. We also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components, such as battery packs and battery chargers, to other manufacturers. We recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Prior to February 2010, we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster although a third-party lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the United States. Under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase. Starting in February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States. Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options, accessories and destination charges. While these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale, they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements. Contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue, including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized. We are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items. Further, we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items, determined by reference to stand-alone sales of such items. 81 Table of Contents To date, we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicle accessories and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. As each of these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer. Increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Development Services Revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers, including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet a customer’s specifications. Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue-generating activity. Revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized, the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured. Where development arrangements include substantive at-risk milestones, revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually-defined milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, we had deferred $4.0 million in revenue related to development services being performed for Toyota. Increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Costs of development services are expensed as incurred. Costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these costs are recorded in cost of development services. Prior to 2010, compensation from the Smart fortwo development arrangement with Daimler, which is discussed below under “Development Compensation”, was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses. This early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage Daimler and at the same time, jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation. Development Compensation We began receiving payments under the Smart fortwo development arrangement with Daimler in the year ended December 31, 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities. We deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones. All amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All development activities under this agreement were completed as of December 31, 2009. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for estimated 82 Table of Contents obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded write-downs of $1.0 million and $1.4 million, in cost of automotive sales, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded write-downs of $3.7 million to research and development expenses and $0.6 million to cost of automotive sales. The inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand, selling prices and production costs. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. Further, a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly, the adjustments that we record may be material. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $5.4 million and $3.8 million in warranty reserves, respectively. Adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales. It is likely that as we sell additional Tesla Roadsters and powertrain components, we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments. Further, a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Valuation of Stock-Based Awards, Common Stock and Warrants Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of the awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period which is generally four years. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures. The fair value of each new employee option awarded was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions. 2010 2009 2008 Risk-free interest rate 2.0% 2.2% 2.2% Expected term (in years) 5.3 4.6 4.6 Expected volatility 71% 64% 53% Dividend yield 0% 0% 0% 83 Table of Contents If in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our limited history with employee grants, we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. Our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries, because we have no trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies. Our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As we accumulate additional employee option data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities, expected lives and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of sales, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. We account for stock options issued to nonemployees also based on their estimated fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. However, the fair value of the equity awards granted to nonemployees is re-measured as the awards vest, and the resulting increase in value, if any, is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered. Common Stock Valuation Upon the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price. Prior to the IPO, we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our Board of Directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock, our Board of Directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following: • our sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties; • our operating and financial performance; • the lack of liquidity of our capital stock; 84 Table of Contents • trends in our industry; • arm’s length, third-party sales of our stock; and • contemporaneous valuations performed by an unrelated third-party. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used, the amount of our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different. The following table summarizes, by grant date, the number of stock options granted since January 1, 2008 through the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, and the associated per share exercise price, which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants. Grant Date Number ofOptionsGranted ExercisePrice andFair Valueper Share ofCommonStock June 4, 2008 762,137 $ 2.70 July 8, 2008 278,308 2.70 September 3, 2008 200,155 2.70 October 29, 2008 205,156 2.70 March 2, 2009 214,813 2.70 April 13, 2009 1,005,837 2.70 April 22, 2009 105,184 2.70 August 4, 2009 323,063 2.94 October 21, 2009 590,638 6.15 December 4, 2009 7,977,444 6.63 December 16, 2009 58,995 6.63 March 3, 2010 402,660 9.96 April 28, 2010 256,320 13.23 June 12, 2010 1,135,710 14.17 Included in the December 4, 2009 awards, were 6,711,972 stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer comprised of two grants. In recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success, the Board of Directors approved an option grant representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base prior to such grant as of December 4, 2009, or 3,355,986 stock options, with 1/4th of the shares vesting immediately, and 1/36th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the Model S—the Board of Directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares prior to such grant as of December 4, 2009, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows, assuming Mr. Musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date: • 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Engineering Prototype; • 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Validation Prototype; • 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the first Model S Production Vehicle; and • 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle. 85 Table of Contents If Mr. Musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant. Included in our June and September 2010 stock option grants were 666,300 and 20,000 stock options granted respectively, to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for Mr. Musk above. Prior to our IPO which was completed on July 2, 2010, our Board of Directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis (income and market approaches) or based on a recent round of financing (option pricing approach). The income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value. We have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us, as a proxy for our cost of capital. Our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business. For example, the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the Model S business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the U.S. Department of Energy. Valuation Date Range ofDiscountRates May 15, 2008 30.0 – 40.0 % December 31, 2008 30.0 – 40.0 % February 28, 2009 30.0 – 40.0 % May 11, 2009 16.2 – 34.8 % August 1, 2009 16.2 – 34.8 % October 15, 2009 12.4 – 27.1 % November 27, 2009 12.4 – 27.1 % February 23, 2010 11.4 – 20.0 % April 21, 2010 14.4 – 20.0 % June 9, 2010 14.5 – 20.0 % Our projected cash flows have been primarily derived from our Tesla Roadster, Model S and powertrain revenue streams. In more recent valuations, these cash flow projections take into account the fact that we have been selling the Tesla Roadster since 2008, that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and our anticipation of Model S production in mid-2012. Under the market approach, the total enterprise value of the company is estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets, or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction. Prior transactions in our stock are also considered as part of the market approach methodology. We have selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries. These valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business, giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects. For those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach. The financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations. The risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. As discussed below, there is inherent 86 Table of Contents uncertainty in these estimates. Second, we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the Option-Pricing Method. The aggregate value of the common stock derived from the Option-Pricing Method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value. For those reports before our IPO that relied on the recent round of financing, we back-solved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price. Our Board of Directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above, the probability and timing of completing an IPO as of those dates, as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations, including the following: • significant operating losses since inception; • macroeconomic uncertainty in 2008; • the absence of a significant IPO market throughout 2008 and continuing through the second quarter of 2009; and • other market developments that influence forecasted revenue. Valuations that we have performed require significant use of estimates and assumptions. If different estimates and assumptions had been used, our common stock valuations could be significantly different and related stock-based compensation expense may be materially impacted. Warrants We have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance. We have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and, therefore, may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future. The warrants are subject to re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to purchase shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. This convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share upon the closing of our IPO in July 2010. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December 15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full, the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. Our ability to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and consequently, the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant. Since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates, we measured the fair value of the DOE warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE warrant over the expected term of the DOE Loan Facility of 13 years. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date. 87 Table of Contents The significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the DOE warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices, as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our DOE Loan Facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us. The estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock-based compensation discussed above. The differential between the interest rates under our DOE Loan Facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business. As the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies, the fair value of our DOE warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt, would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants. Similarly, as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant, the fair value of our DOE warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants, and therefore, we would not prepay our outstanding DOE debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest. Prior to completion of our IPO, the fair value of the DOE warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Upon the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability. The DOE warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $6.1 million. The relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense, net, in future periods which may be significant. Excluding the warrant issued to the DOE in January 2010, we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock-based compensation as discussed above. Upon the completion of our IPO in July 2010, these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of June 30, 2010, were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled. Income Taxes We record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. 88 Table of Contents Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes, such as net operating losses, based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update which requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. The guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011 with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level I and Level II fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using Level III inputs, a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis. The updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring Level II and Level III fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures regarding the reconciliation of Level III fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method. The milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a milestone payment upon achievement if, at the inception of the revenue arrangement, the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 89 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues Automotive sales $ 97,078 $ 111,943 $ 14,742 Development services 19,666 — — Total revenues 116,744 111,943 14,742 Cost of revenues Automotive sales 79,982 102,408 15,883 Development services 6,031 — — Total cost of revenues 86,013 102,408 15,883 Gross profit (loss) 30,731 9,535 (1,141 ) Operating expenses Research and development (net of development compensation of $23,249 for the year ended December 31, 2009) 92,996 19,282 53,714 Selling, general and administrative 84,573 42,150 23,649 Total operating expenses 177,569 61,432 77,363 Loss from operations (146,838 ) (51,897 ) (78,504 ) Interest income 258 159 529 Interest expense (992 ) (2,531 ) (3,747 ) Other expense, net (6,583 ) (1,445 ) (963 ) Loss before income taxes (154,155 ) (55,714 ) (82,685 ) Provision for income taxes 173 26 97 Net loss $ (154,328 ) $ (55,740 ) $ (82,782 ) Revenues Automotive Sales Automotive sales consisted of the following for the periods presented: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Vehicle, options and related sales $ 75,459 $ 111,555 $ 14,742 Powertrain component and related sales 21,619 388 — Total automotive sales $ 97,078 $ 111,943 $ 14,742 Automotive sales during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $97.1 million, a decrease from $111.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Automotive sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $75.5 million of vehicle, options and related sales, and $21.6 million of powertrain component and related sales, compared to $111.6 million of vehicle, options and related sales and $0.4 million of powertrain component and related sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. Automotive sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $14.7 million, comprised primarily of sales of the Tesla Roadster which we began to deliver in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as related zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. Almost all of the revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008, came from fulfilling reservations placed in prior periods. 90 Table of Contents During the first three quarters of 2009, we continued to fulfill reservations for the Tesla Roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009, sales of the Tesla Roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter. Consequently, the comparison of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the year ended December 31, 2009 may not be meaningful. As such, vehicle, options and related sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were more reflective of current demand as compared to the prior year. Similarly, ZEV credit sales which are included in vehicle, options and related sales, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of ZEV credits. The year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the United States. In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in vehicle, options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $0.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 14% of the vehicles delivered during the year were under operating leases. As of December 31, 2010, we had deferred revenues of $1.1 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases. Powertrain component and related sales were comprised primarily of battery packs and chargers that we delivered to supply Daimler’s Smart fortwo program. We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in at least five European cities. We began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of 2009. Prior to 2010, most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the United States and we had no revenues from sales outside of the United States prior to the third quarter of 2009. Our international sales commenced with the launch of the Tesla Roadster in Europe in July 2009 and since then, we have recognized revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster in additional countries including Canada, Japan and Hong Kong. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 55% and 19% of our revenue from vehicle, options and related sales, respectively, were derived outside of the United States. All of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the United States. As we continue to expand into additional new markets, we expect our international automotive sales to increase in aggregate dollar amounts but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues. While revenue related to servicing vehicles has been insignificant to date, we expect such revenues to increase in future periods as we sell more vehicles and as vehicle warranties begin to expire. Development Services Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue-generating activity. We began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of 2010 with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, or Freightliner, an affiliate of Daimler. These battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of Freightliner’s customer trials. Prior to 2010, compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with Daimler 91 Table of Contents for battery packs and chargers for its Smart fortwo program, was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses. This early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage Daimler and at the same time, jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation. During the first quarter of 2010, Daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. We began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of 2010 and had received an aggregate of $5.5 million in payments; however, as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of March 31, 2010, we deferred the $5.5 million of payments that had been received from Daimler to that point. In May 2010, we executed a final agreement under which Daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. As of December 31, 2010, we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $14.4 million in development services revenue. In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Under this early phase development agreement, prototypes would be made by us by combining the Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we began producing and delivering prototypes to Toyota and recognized $1.0 million in development services revenue. In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant to this agreement, Toyota will pay us up to $60.0 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance, including a $5.0 million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed the first milestone and along with the amortization of our upfront payment, we recognized $3.3 million in development services revenue. We intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with Daimler, Toyota and other automobile manufacturers. Additionally, we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $86.0 million, a decrease from $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of 2009 from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to 2009. In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we record cost of automotive sales equal to the depreciation of the leased vehicles on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual leases. Cost of automotive sales related to leased vehicles was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from development services. Cost of development services includes 92 Table of Contents engineering support and testing, direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements. During the quarter ended March 31, 2010, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. As of March 31, 2010, a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such, the related development services costs of $0.5 million that we incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 were expensed in research and development. In May 2010, we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $30.7 million, an increase from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in 2010; an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers; the continued launch of the Tesla Roadster internationally, where in certain markets, we have experienced higher selling prices; and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the Tesla Roadster to the Tesla Roadster 2 during the second half of 2009. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the A-Class development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of revenues, since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in May 2010. Cost of revenues of $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The significant increase in cost of revenues was due to the increase in Tesla Roadster sales from which we began to recognize revenue during the fourth quarter of 2008; higher warranty expense; and the model changeover from the Tesla Roadster to the Tesla Roadster 2 as well as significant part changes implemented to improve the design and reduce per unit costs, for which we recorded charges to cost of revenues in the amount of $1.4 million for excess and obsolete inventory during the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1.1 million due to the lower average selling prices for our initial vehicles, the high materials and manufacturing costs associated with our first generation Tesla Roadster and limited economies of scale from low vehicle production volumes. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $9.5 million benefited from higher per unit revenue and reduced manufacturing cost from increased volume and component re-design. We expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria. This may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. Also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur, if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $93.0 million, an increase from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 included $23.2 million in Daimler Smart fortwo development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses. The $73.7 million increase in research and 93 Table of Contents development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a $25.0 million increase in employee cash and stock-based compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our Model S and powertrain development activities, the $23.2 million Daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009, a $10.5 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our Model S alpha build as well as powertrain development activities; a $10.7 million increase in professional and outside services costs related to Model S engineering, design and testing activities; and a $1.6 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business, including our transition to our Palo Alto headquarters. During the first quarter of 2010, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. As of March 31, 2010, a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such, the related development services costs of $0.5 million that we incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 were expensed in research and development. In May 2010, we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues. Research and development expenses of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $34.4 million decrease in research and development expenses was a result of the $23.2 million Daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended December 31, 2009, a $13.3 million decrease resulting from the allocation of various manufacturing-related costs to inventory and cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production, a $3.2 million decrease in charges related to excess and obsolescence, adverse purchase commitments and materials and tooling expense due both to the classification of production-related costs to cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production as well as lower outside professional services, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in employee compensation expenses associated with higher headcount for the year ended December 31, 2009. We began receiving payments under the Smart fortwo development arrangement with Daimler in the year ended December 31, 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities. We deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing, as an offset to our research and development expenses, the deferred development compensation of $14.5 million on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009, were recognized, as an offset to our research and development expenses, upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones. We did not recognize any development compensation from Daimler during the year ended December 31, 2008. Since the commercial launch of the Tesla Roadster, our investment in related research and development has decreased significantly. We have, however, significantly increased our research and development efforts for the Model S, which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses in both aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of our revenues. We anticipate that this trend will continue on an annual basis as we incur additional costs to develop the Model S and to operate our planned Model S manufacturing facility in Fremont, California prior to the start of Model S production. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services. 94 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $84.6 million, an increase from $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $42.4 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a $15.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards, expense related to performance-based awards, an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in 2010, and the $2.4 million correction of additional stock-based compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009; a $13.4 million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the United States and Europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business; a $7.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business, including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our Palo Alto headquarters; a $3.2 million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities; and a $1.0 million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work, recruiting, as well as general corporate development activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $18.6 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted primarily of an $8.4 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support our opening of additional stores in the United States and Europe, as well as higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business and our efforts to become a public company; a $4.7 million increase in office, information technology and facilities costs to support the growth of our business, including the opening of new stores; a $2.0 million increase in legal services and legal settlements and accounting and other consulting services to support our growth; and a $1.3 million increase in costs principally related to increased marketing activities. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase both in aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations, increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned Model S commercial launch in mid-2012, and as we support the requirements of being a public company. We also expect an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of our planned increase in the number of Tesla stores. As of December 31, 2010, we had opened Tesla stores in the United States, Europe and Japan. We plan to open additional stores during 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.0 million, a decrease from $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock in May 2009, while interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to our loans under the DOE Loan Facility which we began accessing in 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we capitalized $0.8 million of interest expense to assets under construction. Interest expense of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in interest expense was due to the conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock in May 2009. We expect interest expense to increase as we continue to draw down on the DOE Loan Facility to fund our Model S and powertrain activities. 95 Table of Contents Other Expense, Net Other expense, net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Income or charges resulting from the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability, excluding the DOE warrant liability, was eliminated after July 2, 2010, as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our IPO. The DOE convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in January 2010, became a common stock warrant on July 2 and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. Other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $6.6 million, an increase in expense compared to other expense, net, of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in May 2010, both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation. Other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily a result of a $1.8 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses associated with a higher level of foreign currency denominated purchases as well as the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the fair value change of our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.2 million, an increase from the provision for income taxes of $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to the launch of the Tesla Roadster in Europe in July 2009 and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions in subsequent periods. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized research and development benefits from our foreign operations which decreased our provision for income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from the provision for income taxes of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to the research and development benefits that we recognized in 2009 from our foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $566.4 million principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents, cash held in our dedicated DOE account and the remaining amounts available under the DOE Loan Facility. This includes cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $99.6 million which included investments in money market funds, cash of $73.6 million deposited in a dedicated DOE account in accordance with the requirements of our DOE Loan Facility, and $393.2 million available under the DOE Loan Facility, which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of the Model S and our powertrain activities. Our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, and through December 31, 2009, we had raised an aggregate of $319.2 million from convertible preferred stock and convertible note financings. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we entered into our $465.0 million DOE Loan Facility from which we have begun to make draw downs, as well as completing our IPO and private placements with Toyota and Panasonic. Other sources of cash have also included reservation payments from customers for the Tesla Roadster and more recently from sales of the Tesla Roadster, 96 Table of Contents cash from the provision of electric powertrain development services, sales of powertrain components, draw downs from the DOE Loan Facility and refundable reservation payments for our Model S. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, cash held in our dedicated DOE account and the remaining amounts available under the DOE Loan Facility, together with our anticipated cash from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through the anticipated initial customer deliveries of the Model S. This capital will fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, establish sales and service centers, improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities, and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce the Model S. The acceleration of the development of future vehicles, investments in new technologies, increased insourcing of manufacturing capabilities, investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit. We may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. DOE Loan Facility On January 20, 2010, we entered into our DOE Loan Facility for $465.0 million to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components, or the Powertrain facility. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 91.5% of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our Model S sedan, or the Model S facility. Our obligations for the development of, and the build-out of our manufacturing facility for, the Model S is budgeted to be an aggregate of $33 million or approximately 8.5% of the ongoing budgeted cost, plus any cost overruns for the projects. Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. We are currently in compliance with these draw conditions. For the Powertrain facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S facility, the remaining draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility. Certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to draw-down related to the site on which the applicable project is located. We are currently progressing towards our milestones. Additionally, the DOE Loan Facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need arise. Loans may be requested under the facilities until January 22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. Through December 31, 2010, we had received loans under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $71.8 million with interest rates ranging from 1.7% to 3.4%. In February 2011, we received additional loans under the DOE Loan Facility for $15.6 million at interest rates ranging from 2.6% to 3.0%. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on December 15, 2012 (or for advances made after such date, in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 2019. Advances under the Model S Facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on December 15, 2012 (or for advances made after such date, in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Model S Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 2022. Advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time. All obligations under the DOE Loan Facility are secured by substantially all of our property. 97 Table of Contents The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for certain defaults. In addition, events of default include a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility. In addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above, we have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent Toyota private placement and any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects, up to an aggregate of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. This dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and Model S manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front, which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the dedicated account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. We will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw-down of additional loans under our DOE Loan Facility once used in full, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. Upon the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement on July 2, 2010, we transferred $100.0 million of the net proceeds from the IPO and the concurrent private placement to fund the dedicated account. During third and fourth quarters of 2010, we transferred $26.4 million from the dedicated account to our operating cash accounts in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2010, $73.6 million remained in the dedicated account. As we expect to transfer the remainder of this balance within one year, we have recorded such cash as current restricted cash. In February 2011, we transferred an additional $15.6 million from the dedicated account. For additional information related to our DOE Loan Facility, please see Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Initial Public Offering and Toyota Concurrent Private Placement On June 28, 2010, our registration statement on Form S-1 relating to our IPO was declared effective by the SEC. The IPO closed on July 2, 2010, at which time we sold 11,880,600 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of $188.8 million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. Additionally, we incurred offering costs of $4.4 million related to the IPO. Concurrent with the closing of our IPO, we sold 2,941,176 shares of our common stock to Toyota in a private placement transaction for aggregate proceeds of $50.0 million. Panasonic Private Placement In November 2010, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity affiliated with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,418,573 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of $30.0 million. 98 Table of Contents Leasing Activities In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. When compared to our sales of vehicles, our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle, over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle. As such, our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly, the impact may be material. However, after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash, our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity, as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased vehicles that are manufactured to specification, we do not believe that our planned leasing operations will materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due. As we will also be exposed to credit risk related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers, we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We intend to require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer’s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our vehicles outright. During the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 14% of the vehicles delivered during the period were under operating leases. As of December 31, 2010, we had deferred revenues of $1.1 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases. Through December 31, 2010, our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. Reservation Payments A source of our cash flows from operations has been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers. Reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a Tesla Roadster or Model S. For our 2010 model year Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase. For the Model S, we require an initial reservation payment of at least $5,000. For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is required. Prior to the second quarter of 2010, our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a Tesla Roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications. During the second quarter of 2010, we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement. However, we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications. For customers who have placed a reservation payment with us, the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. The full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. We do not believe that these changes will materially impact our liquidity or capital resources. Reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received. No later than upon the delivery of a vehicle, the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle. Reservation payments are expected to fluctuate as the number of reservation holders on the Tesla Roadster reservation list decreases, while the number of reservation holders on the Model S reservation list increases. 99 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flows 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (127,817 ) $ (80,825 ) $ (52,412 ) Net cash used in investing activities (180,297 ) (14,244 ) (11,590 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 338,045 155,419 56,068 Cash Flows from Operating Activities We continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally. Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately $330.6 million of cash in operations through December 31, 2010. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities was $127.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of $154.3 million, which included non-cash charges of $21.2 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $10.6 million related to depreciation and amortization and $5.0 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liabilities. Significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to $177.6 million of operating expenses, $86.0 million of cost of revenues, a $20.1 million increase in inventory, an $8.4 million increase in operating lease vehicles, and a $5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $13.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $3.5 million increase in other long-term liabilities. Inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the Tesla Roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business, as well as our increased manufacturing and Model S development activities. Operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010. Other long-term liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the Tesla Roadster. Significant operating cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2010 were derived primarily from automotive sales of $97.1 million, $19.7 million of development services revenue, a $4.8 million increase in deferred revenues and a $4.7 million increase in reservation payments, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in accounts receivable. In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Upon execution of the agreement, we received a $5.0 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance. Deferred revenues also increased from our vehicle leasing activities as we are recognizing the lease down-payments over the term of the operating leases. The increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to Daimler’s Smart fortwo program as well as $2.3 million receivable from Toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the Phase 1 contract services agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $10.4 million of net new reservation payments for the Model S while reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster decreased by $5.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $80.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The largest component of our cash used during this year was the $55.7 million net loss, which included non-cash charges of $6.9 million related to depreciation and amortization, $2.7 million related to interest on convertible notes and $1.4 million related to inventory write-downs, as well as a non-cash gain of $1.5 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants. Significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to $102.4 million of cost of revenues, $61.4 million of operating expenses, a $7.9 million increase in inventory and 100 Table of Contents a $2.0 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $0.9 million increase in accounts payable. Inventory increased to meet our production requirements while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflect a higher level of annual operating costs such as insurance, licenses and taxes from the growth of the business. The increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business. Significant operating cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the Tesla Roadster as well as development compensation related to the Daimler development agreement. Cash inflows related to automotive sales activity were $88.5 million comprised of $111.9 million of automotive sales, partially offset by a $22.0 million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a $1.5 million decrease in deferred revenues. The decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the Tesla Roadster during the year ended December 31, 2008. As we continued to deliver the Tesla Roadster to our customers in 2009, we applied the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost. Cash inflows from the Daimler development agreement were $13.2 million comprised primarily of $23.2 million of development compensation partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in deferred development compensation. The decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash used in operating activities was $52.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The largest component of our cash used during this period, was the $82.8 million net loss, which included non-cash charges of $4.3 million related to inventory write-downs, $4.2 million related to depreciation and amortization, $3.7 million related to interest on convertible notes and $2.8 million related to the fair value change in our convertible preferred stock warrant liability, as well as a non-cash gain of $1.2 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants. Significant operating cash outflows were driven primarily by $77.4 million of operating expenses, $15.9 million of cost of sales, and an $18.8 million increase in inventory, partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in accounts payable and a $2.6 million increase in accrued liabilities. We had increased inventory in anticipation of the commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster. Accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased primarily due to the significant increase in activities to bring the Tesla Roadster to production. We benefited from operating cash inflows related to Tesla Roadster reservation activity and our development efforts. Cash inflows derived from Tesla Roadster sales and reservation activity were $29.4 million comprised primarily of $14.7 million of automotive sales, a $10.7 million increase in refundable reservation payments and a $4.1 million increase in deferred revenues. Refundable reservation payments increased reflecting new reservation activity received during the year partially offset by the reservation payments we applied to our customers’ purchase cost as we began delivering Tesla Roadsters during the year ended December 31, 2008. Deferred revenues increased primarily from customer payments we collected for certain Tesla Roadsters that we had delivered but as to which we had unfulfilled obligations related to powertrain upgrades. We received cash from Daimler of $8.6 million for our development efforts during the year ended December 31, 2008 although the amounts were deferred entirely until we executed a final agreement in May 2009, which is reflected in the related increase in deferred development compensation of $10.2 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1.6 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities We continue to experience negative cash flows from investing activities as we expand our business, build our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally and develop our Model S manufacturing capabilities. Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in Model S manufacturing, as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to our DOE Loan Facility, facility lease agreements, equipment financing, and certain vendor credit policies. Net cash used in investing activities was $180.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to capital purchases of $105.4 million and a net increase in restricted cash of $74.9 million. The increase 101 Table of Contents in capital purchases was driven primarily by $65.2 million of payments made in relation to our purchase of the manufacturing facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, and certain manufacturing assets located thereon to be used for our planned Model S manufacturing, as well as $40.2 million primarily related to other Model S capital expenditures, our transition to and build out of our powertrain manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and purchases of manufacturing equipment. Our purchase transactions with NUMMI were completed in October 2010. The increase in restricted cash was primarily related to $100.0 million of net proceeds from our IPO and concurrent Toyota private placement that we transferred to a dedicated account as required by our DOE Loan Facility, partially offset by $26.4 million that was transferred out of the dedicated account during the third and fourth quarters of 2010 in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $14.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily related to capital purchases of $11.9 million and an increase in restricted cash of $2.4 million. The increase in restricted cash was primarily related to standard credit policies required by our online payment vendor and security deposits related to lease agreements and equipment financing. Net cash used in investing activities was $11.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily related to capital purchases of $10.6 million and an increase in restricted cash of $1.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities is expected to increase substantially in 2011 as we build out and tool our Model S manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and our powertrain manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of $190 million to $215 million during 2011. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of $296.8 million on a cumulative basis through December 31, 2009, from loans under the DOE Loan Facility beginning in 2010, and more recently, from the net proceeds from our IPO and private placements. Cash provided by financing activities was $338.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 comprised primarily of $188.8 million in proceeds from our IPO, $71.8 million we received from our loans under the DOE Loan Facility, $50.0 million in proceeds from the Toyota private placement, $30.0 million in proceeds from the Panasonic private placement, partially offset by $3.7 million of issuance costs we incurred in relation to our DOE Loan Facility and our IPO. Cash provided by financing activities was $155.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 comprised primarily of $82.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series E convertible preferred stock, $49.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series E convertible preferred stock and $25.5 million in proceeds received from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants. Cash provided by financing activities was $56.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 comprised primarily of $54.8 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes. 102 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2010 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter Operating lease obligations $ 53,431 $ 6,793 $ 6,625 $ 6,561 $ 6,431 $ 5,893 $ 21,128 Capital lease obligations 823 318 286 219 — — — Long-term debt 71,828 — 2,198 8,791 8,791 8,791 43,257 Purchase obligations (1) 15,400 15,400 — — — — — $ 141,482 $ 22,511 $ 9,109 $ 15,571 $ 15,222 $ 14,684 $ 64,385 (1) Obligations include significant agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and where the significant terms are specified. Where a minimum purchase obligation is stipulated, as in the case of our supply agreement with Lotus Cars Limited (Lotus), the amounts included in the table reflect the minimum purchase amounts. Our minimum purchase obligations related to Lotus are based on the December 31, 2010 exchange rate for the British pound and reflect our most current supply terms. Purchase obligations that are cancelable without significant penalty, are not included in the table. In October 2010, we completed the purchase of our Fremont, California manufacturing facility from NUMMI. NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater, and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues, we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination. Based on management’s best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million, which is not reflected in the table above as the timing of any potential payments cannot be reasonably determined at this time. As NUMMI continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our planned construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held reservation payments of $30.8 million and $26.0 million from potential customers, respectively, which are not reflected in the table above. As of December 31, 2010, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate amount of $2.5 million and reservation payments for Model S sedans in an aggregate amount of $28.3 million. As of December 31, 2009, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate amount of $8.2 million and reservation 103 Table of Contents payments for Model S sedans in an aggregate amount of $17.9 million. In order to convert the reservation payments into revenue, we will need to sell vehicles to these customers. All reservation payments for the Model S are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk A portion of our revenues, costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were denominated in foreign currencies. This is primarily due to the contract with Lotus Cars Limited, or Lotus, in the United Kingdom to manufacture the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in Europe. In addition, our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses denominated in foreign currencies, principally in the British pound, the euro and the Japanese yen. This cost exposure is partially offset by our recent sales growth in these regions since payments for vehicles sold in these regions are denominated in the local currency. This provides a partial natural hedge to our cost exposure in Europe and Asia depending on our sales levels in these regions. Our battery cell purchases from Asian suppliers are also subject to currency risk. Although our present contracts are United States dollar based, if the United States dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency, it could cause our Asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices, which could harm our financial results. To date, the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been significant. Interest Rate Risk We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $99.6 million as of December 31, 2010. A portion of these amounts were invested in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income. As of December 31, 2010, we have received loans under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $71.8 million with interest rates ranging from 1.7% to 3.4%. As we continue to borrow under our DOE Loan Facility, interest rates will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of each loan, based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such loan. We also have capital lease obligations of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2010 which are fixed rate instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. 104 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:12:51.315874

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and 2015 Highlights We design, develop, manufacture, and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, and energy storage products. We are currently producing and selling our Model S sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle. Since the introduction of Model S in June 2012, we have enhanced our vehicle offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, and free over-the-air software updates. We commenced customer deliveries of our Model X in September 2015 and are currently ramping production. We have delivered over 107,000 vehicles through December 31, 2015. We intend to unveil Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in the first quarter of 2016 and expect to commence production and deliveries of this vehicle in late 2017. In addition to our automotive products, we recently announced the next generation of our energy storage products, the 7 kWh and 10 kWh Powerwall for residential applications and the 100 kWh Powerpack for commercial and industrial applications. We began production and deliveries of these products, which we will sell under the Tesla Energy brand, in the third quarter of 2015. We transitioned the production of these products from the Fremont Factory to the Gigafactory during Q4 2015. Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total revenues of $4.05 billion, an increase of $847.7 million over total revenues of $3.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by growth of Model S deliveries worldwide. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 22.8%, a decrease from 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We continue to increase our sales and service footprint worldwide and expand our Supercharging and destination charging networks. With the continued global expansion of our customer support and Supercharger infrastructure, selling, general and administrative expenses were $922.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $603.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2014. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Vehicle Orders, Production and Deliveries We are currently producing and selling both the Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle. We have broadened the appeal of Model S by introducing new variants that improve range, performance, and value. For those wanting a more affordable car, we introduced Model S 70 with a starting price of only $70,000 before incentives and fuel savings. Our new 90kWh battery pack option enables almost 300 miles of range at 65 mph. Finally, for our performance enthusiasts, the new Ludicrous mode option improves 0 to 60 mph acceleration to 2.8 seconds. The introduction of Model X now provides customers with a performance electric vehicle option in the sport utility segment for the first time. Similar to Model S, we expect to introduce new versions and functionality for the Model X over time. Overall, we expect that demand for our vehicles will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles, as we grow our customer sales and service infrastructure, and as we continue to develop our products. We have been increasing our production activities and expect to continue to do so. In August 2014, we began a significant production capacity increase at the Tesla Factory by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center. These production capacity increases continued into 2015, with further investments including building a new paint shop, a new body shop for Model X, and additional stamping capacity. We expect our annual production will increase considerably each year for the next several years. In addition, scaling our deliveries means that we will have an increasing number of cars in-transit, therefore production will exceed deliveries. During 2015, we achieved significant efficiencies in Model S production and produced 14,037 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2015. We began production of Model X in the third quarter of 2015. We plan to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new Model S and Model X vehicles in 2016. 32 In addition to expanding our vehicle production, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters. We expect that this trend will contribute to improved automotive gross margin over time, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements. Significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved in 2014 and 2015 relating to material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions, and manufacturing efficiencies, excluding the impact of newly introduced Model S variants and Model X. However, during our product introductions over the last few years, we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin. We expect that automotive gross margin should increase during 2016 due to cost reductions for Model S and improving margin on Model X as our manufacturing efficiency improves for that vehicle, supporting our plan to be profitable for the fourth quarter of 2016. If we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or ramp Model X efficiently, our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected in the short-term. To support our planned vehicle growth in 2016, we plan to continue expanding stores and service infrastructure worldwide, provide more timely service in areas with a high concentration of Tesla customers, and continue expanding our Supercharger and destination charger network. Since we now offer our vehicles in many countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia, our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. We expect our long-term sales outside of North America will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue. As compared to markets in the United States, we have relatively limited experience in international markets, and thus we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans. If we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding and opening desirable locations for stores and service centers, we may not be able to meet our delivery plans. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses We expect to see a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the full-year 2016. We plan to fund about $1.5 billion in capital expenditures without accessing any outside capital other than our existing sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory. We plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory, begin installation of Model 3 vehicle production machinery, open about 80 retail locations and service centers, and energize about 300 new Supercharger locations. Our operating expenses are expected to grow by about 20% in 2016 as compared to 2015, driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service centers as well as increases in general and administrative costs to support the growth of the business. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $339.2 million and $107.8 million and as of December 31, 2015 included 584 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia and expect such spending to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016. During 2016, this investment will grow our Supercharger network by about 50%. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. Customer Financing Options We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of December 31, 2015 had approximately 18,400 vehicles under this program. We expanded this program to selected European and Asian markets during the first half of 2015. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months total $136.8 million in value and relate to 3,017 vehicles. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Alternatively, in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the expiration of the guarantee period, the remaining deferred revenues and costs will be recognized at no gross profit. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. 33 We currently offer leases in the U.S. directly from our captive financing entity, as well as through a leasing partner. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We also offer financing arrangements through entities in Canada, Germany and UK. As of December 31, 2015, we had leased approximately 3,660 vehicles through our captive financing entities in the U.S. and Germany and approximately 6,730 vehicles through our leasing partner. Leasing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities (but not for those offered through our bank partner), we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our leasing offerings. The Gigafactory We are developing the Gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules and battery packs in one location. We broke ground on the Gigafactory in June 2014 and began assembling our Tesla Energy products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015. We currently expect to produce cells at this site beginning in 2016 for use initially in our Tesla Energy products and later for our vehicles. Over the next few years, we will continue to invest in the expansion of additional Tesla Energy production capacity. We continue to invest in construction of the building and utilities at the Gigafactory and in production equipment for battery, module and pack production. We will be responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory and will engage with partners who have significant experience in battery cell and material production. Panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the Gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within ASC 840 – Leases, we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in 2016. Given the size and complexity of this undertaking, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations, we may have difficulty signing up additional partners, and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Vehicle sales include standard features, customer selected options and accessories, and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including free internet connectivity, access to our Supercharger network, and future over the air software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the vehicle, except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third party pricing of similar options, and other information which may be available. 34 Vehicle sales to customers with a residual value guarantee We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified banking partners. Under this program, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a pre-determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we are required to account for these as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the stated guarantee period. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles to leased vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period. In cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of December 31, 2015, $136.8 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a residual value guarantee In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840 - Leases. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the long-term portion and deferred revenue for the current portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the residual value guarantee amount, or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue. In cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive revenue. The maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program, assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is $348.2 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $527.5 million and $16.7 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and $120.5 million and $3.9 million recorded in deferred revenue liability. At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be significant changes to their estimated values. Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the United States, Canada and Germany. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for 36 or 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had deferred $25.8 million and $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we recognized $41.2 million and $4.4 million Maintenance and Service Plans We offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles, provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations. 35 We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems, and Tesla Energy products we sell. At the time of delivery, we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements. Costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities, expected lives and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 36 In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our CEO (2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date. Each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten pre-determined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant. · Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype; · Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype; · Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle; · Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype; · Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype; · Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; · Gross margin of 30% or more for four consecutive quarters; · Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles; · Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles; and · Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles. The term of the 2012 CEO Grant is ten years, so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant will be forfeited. In addition, unvested options will be forfeited if our CEO is no longer in that role, whether for cause or otherwise. We measured the fair value of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.65%, expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and dividend yield of 0%. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met. As of December 31, 2015, the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our Board of Directors, and therefore four of ten tranches of the 2012 CEO Grant were vested as of such date: · Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype · Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype; and · Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle · Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles As of December 31, 2015 the following two performance milestones were considered probable of achievement: · Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype; and · Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype As the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, $25.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Additionally, no cash compensation has ever been received by our CEO for his services to the Company. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. 37 Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. Results of Operations Revenues Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new Model S and Model X vehicles, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and over the air software updates, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees, and vehicle leasing revenue. Services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services, service plans and merchandise, sales of pre-owned Tesla vehicles, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, Tesla Energy products, and net sales of non-Tesla vehicle trade-ins. Automotive revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $3.74 billion, $3.00 billion, and $1.92 billion. The increase was primarily driven by the ramp in vehicle deliveries. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 automotive revenue includes $309.4 million, $132.6 million and $33.5 million from the accretion of the deferred revenues from our resale value guarantee and other similar programs, as well as Tesla leasing. Service and other revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $305.0 million, $191.3 million, and $91.6 million, related primarily to increases in pre-owned vehicle sales and maintenance service revenue in all years, and increased powertrain sales in 2014 as compared to 2013. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of automotive revenues includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for on-hand inventory that is either obsolete or is in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $2.82 billion, $2.15 billion, and $1.48 billion. The increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased Model S deliveries. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized $172.4 million, $84.5, and $21.1 million in cost of automotive revenues related to cars accounted for as operating leases. Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs for repair and maintenance services, allocations of service center overhead costs, pre-owned Tesla vehicle sales, sales of our powertrain components, and costs related to the production and sale of Tesla Energy products. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 costs of services and other revenue were $299.2 million, $170.9 million, and $73.9 million. The increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater pre-owned vehicle sales and increased maintenance and repair services in all years, and increased powertrain sales to Daimler in 2014 as compared to 2013. 38 Gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $923.5 million, $881.7 million and $456.3 million Gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 22.8%, 27.6%, and 22.7%. The lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift, as a greater percentage of sales were derived from vehicle models with lower average selling prices, and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor Model S vehicles and start of Model X production, obsolete inventory and lower ZEV credits revenue. This margin decrease was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross margin and from material cost savings. Services and other gross margin were also down year over year, primarily driven by a planned price reduction for powertrain sales to Daimler. The increase in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies as well as component cost reductions and higher regulatory credit sales, partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and launch of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S. Research and Development Expenses Research and development (R&D) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $717.9 million, an increase from $464.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in R&D expenses consisted primarily of a $93.9 million increase in expensed materials primarily to support our Model X development and Model S improvements, a $75.9 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $30.6 million increase in facilities and depreciation costs, a $20.1 million increase in costs related to Model X, Autopilot and dual motor powertrain engineering, design and testing activities and a $22.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $464.7 million, an increase from $232.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in R&D expenses consisted primarily of an $85.3 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $60.7 million increase in expensed materials primarily to support our Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand drive Model S development, a $50.9 million increase in costs related to Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand drive Model S engineering, design and testing activities, a $28.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted, a $4.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs and a $3.3 million increase in shipping charges for Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand drive Model S development. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla retail and service stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, settlements and fees for professional and contract services supporting these functions. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $922.2 million, an increase from $603.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and facility costs, including stock based compensation, to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business. The increase in our SG&A expenses consisted primarily of a $138.4 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales, service and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, $126.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, a $41.8 million increase in professional and outside services costs, and a $12.2 million increase in stock based compensation. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $603.7 million, an increase from $285.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. SG&A expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and facility costs to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business. The $318.1 million increase in our SG&A expenses consisted primarily of a $141.1 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales, service and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, a $135.9 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, a $35.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional headcount and increasing value of awards granted and a $27.2 million increase in professional and outside services costs. Interest Expense Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $118.9 million, $100.9 million, and $32.9 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the issuance of $920.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.38 billion aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes during the first half of 2014. 39 Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability. Our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates. Prior to the expiration of the DOE warrant in May 2013, the DOE warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was ($41.7) million, $1.8 million and $22.6 million. Fluctuations in other income (expense) from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange of ($45.6) million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Foreign currency losses during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro, Norwegian krone, Canadian dollars, and Chinese yuan. Other income, net of $22.6 million in 2013 was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million during the year. Other income, net, also includes the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2013, especially related to the Japanese yen. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $13.0 million, $9.4 million, and $2.6 million. The increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.20 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including $297.8 million of money market funds. Amounts held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of $535.6 million as of December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of euro, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Swedish krone, Canadian dollars, euro, and Japanese yen. Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, as well as customer deposits, sales of regulatory credits, proceeds from financing activities, Tesla Energy products, and repair and maintenance services. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity over the next 12 months based on our current plans. These cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations, research and development projects for our planned Model 3, and certain other future products; purchase tooling and manufacturing equipment required to continue to ramp up production of Model X and Model S; construct our Gigafactory; and establish and expand our retail stores, service centers and Supercharger network. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of about $1.5 billion in 2016. In 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks under which we currently have total commitments of up to $1 billion. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, which we may draw upon as needed, subject to certain conditions. Borrowed funds bear interest, at the Company’s option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. In February 2016, we amended the Credit Agreement and increased the availability and the commitments under the Credit Agreement from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2015, borrowings under the Credit Facility of $135.0 million were used to repay all borrowings under and terminate a secured asset based line of credit we used to support our direct leasing program. When market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to pursue liquidity options to fund capital intensive initiatives. Should prevailing economic, financial, business or other factors adversely affect our ability to meet our operating cash requirements, we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (524,499 ) $ (57,337 ) $ 264,804 Net cash used in investing activities (1,673,551 ) (990,444 ) (249,417 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 1,523,523 2,143,130 635,422 40 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our vehicles, customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory credits, cash from the provision of development services, and sales of powertrain components and systems. These cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating leases and interest expense on our financings. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was ($524.5) million, ($57.3) million and $264.8 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to an increase in overall inventory to support growth, and increase in operating lease vehicles, partially offset by proceeds from sales, and higher operating expenses in R&D and SG&A. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to an increase in finished goods inventory primarily due to cars whose delivery slipped from Q4 of 2014 to the following year, an increase in raw material inventory balances at year end necessary to meet our planned production requirements for Model S in Q1 of the following year, higher operating expenses in R&D and SG&A, and use of cash for vehicles directly leased by us, partially offset by increased cash receipts from customer payments on vehicle sales, including an increase in customer deposits. Customer Deposits We collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and, in some locations, at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle. Amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery. As of December 31, 2015, we held $283.4 million in customer deposits. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in Model S manufacturing equipment and tooling and our stores, service centers and Supercharger network infrastructure. Cash used in investing activities was $1.67 billion, $990.4 million and $249.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.63 billion, $969.9 million, and $264.2 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Expenditures in all years consisted primarily of purchases of capital equipment, tooling, and facilities to support our Model S and Model X manufacturing. In 2014, we began construction of our Gigafactory facility in Nevada. Tesla’s contribution to total capital expenditures are expected to be about $2.0 billion over the next 5 years. In 2015, we used cash of $220.0 million towards the construction of the first stage of this project and expect to spend up to $250 million over the next 12 months. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.52 billion, $2.14 billion and $635.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Cash flows from financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $738.3 million net proceeds from August 2015 public offering of 3,099,173 shares of common stock and $568.7 received from vehicle sales to our bank leasing partners. The decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds received in 2014 from issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes. The increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, including the associated hedge and warrant transactions, representing a $1.5 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013. Cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of $415.0 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and $452.3 million used to repay our DOE loans. 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In 2014, we issued $920.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.38 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from the 2021 Notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for the 2019 and 2021 Notes, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. 41 In connection with the offering of these notes in 2014, we purchased convertible note hedges for $603.4 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $389.2 million in aggregate. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $177.5 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $120.3 million in aggregate. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2016. As such, we classified the $617.7 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $42.1 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other current assets as of December 31, 2015. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. For more information on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes see Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 - Convertible Notes and Long-Term Debt Obligations. Common Stock Offering and Concurrent Private Placement Concurrent with the execution of the 2018 Notes and related transactions in May 2013, we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,902,862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $355.1 million (which includes 487,857 shares or $45.0 million sold to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. We also sold 596,272 shares of our common stock to our CEO and received total cash proceeds of $55.0 million in a private placement at the public offering price. In August 2015, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,099,173 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $738.3 million (which includes 82,645 shares or $20.0 million sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. We have the following contractual obligations, including firm purchase obligations. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table below were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part at our discretion and are therefore not considered firm purchase obligations. 42 The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2015 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 and thereafter Operating lease obligations $ 570,864 $ 88,629 $ 86,661 $ 78,531 $ 69,013 $ 248,030 Capital lease obligations, including interest 34,679 16,758 11,321 5,488 1,112 — Purchase obligations (1)(2) 549,716 537,719 11,997 — — 2018 Notes, including interest (3) 684,537 684,537 — — — — 2019 Notes, including interest 928,050 2,300 2,300 2,300 1,150 920,000 2021 Notes, including interest 1,474,875 17,250 17,250 17,250 17,250 1,405,875 Total $ 4,242,721 $ 1,347,193 $ 129,529 $ 103,569 $ 88,525 $ 2,573,905 (1) Amounts do not include future cash payments for purchase obligations which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities at December 31, 2015. (2) These totals represent aggregate purchase commitments with all vendors. Some of the commitments included are our agreements with Panasonic Corporation, to the extent quantities and timing of such purchases are fixed. Should we terminate the Panasonic contracts prior to purchasing certain minimum quantities, we would owe an additional $57 million under the terms of the agreement as of December 31, 2015. (3) During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2016. As such, we classified the $617.7 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and have included related contractual payments in the 2016 category in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the U.S. dollar. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances. As of December 31, 2015, our largest currency exposures are from the euro, Chinese yuan, Norwegian and Danish krona, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, British pound, and Japanese yen. We recorded foreign exchange losses of $45.6 million in other income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 related the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies as of December 31, 2015 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $189.2 million, recorded to other income (expense), net, principally from intercompany and cash balances. 43 In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss. We reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are considered effective hedges, we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts. We have recorded zero amount of ineffectiveness within other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 we had recorded a gain of $7.3 million to AOCI related to our foreign currency cash flow hedges. If the U.S. dollar had strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been a loss of approximately $21.1 million. Interest Rate Risk We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.20 billion as of December 31, 2015. A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2015, we had $2.96 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding, which are fixed rate instruments. Therefore, our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. However, the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. 44",2023-12-31 03:12:38.157650

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and 2016 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, as well as provide energy storage through the offering of Powerpack and Powerwall. In addition, through our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation, we also provide solar energy systems to residential and commercial customers . As a result of our acquisition of SolarCity, we have reclassified the presentation of our historic energy storage products revenue and cost of revenue from services and other to energy generation and storage. Automotive We produce and sell our Model S sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, Internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, we introduced second generation of autopilot which has improved hardware and enhanced functionalities including better safety and performance. In 2016, our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies. During 2016, our production volume increased by 64% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began delivering Model X sport utility vehicle. In 2016, we greatly ramped the production and deliveries of Model X. Also, in the first quarter of 2016, we unveiled Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, which received significant interest. To date, we have substantially completed the design and prototypes of Model 3 and are projecting to start production and deliveries in the second half of 2017. Energy Generation and Storage Through our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation, or SolarCity, on November 21, 2016, we lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy to our customers, typically at prices below utility rates. Our long-term agreements with our customers generate a predictable and reliable stream of cash flows. The operating results of SolarCity from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Also in 2016, we introduced solar roof, which we plan to begin selling and installing later in 2017. In addition to solar energy systems, we also sell energy storage products, which consists of the Powerwall for residential applications and the Powerpack for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications. In 2016, we completed several of our grid-scale energy storage projects, including the Southern California Edison Mira Loma substation and the American Samoa Island installation. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2017 Outlook Automotive Demand, Production and Deliveries During 2016, we improved our existing Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle by introducing new variants that improve range, performance, safety and value. We introduced several new features, including updating the front fascia of Model S in the second quarter of 2016, to expanding offerings of our battery size to cater to a wider range of consumers. We expect to introduce further new vehicle variants and over-the-air-functionality over time. We also expect that the demand for our vehicles will continue to increase as we improve our vehicles, and expand our retail, service and charging infrastructure and as we develop new products. In addition, the introduction of Model 3 would also generate incremental demand by offering a less expensive alternative. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued our resale value guarantee program in North America. The resale value guarantee was originally introduced in 2013 to help to reassure customers that Tesla vehicles would retain value over time. We continue to make progress in increasing vehicle production. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced approximately 84,000 vehicles, an increase of 64% from the prior year. This increase was achieved despite the fact that we faced challenges in 2016 with Model X production, including part shortages. In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH, a German manufacturing company with expertise in automated production. We expect this acquisition will facilitate and expand vehicle production. 35 In the first quarter of 2016, we announced our target to increase overall vehicle production level to 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Increasing production will require additional capital. We have started the installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1, and we are on track to support volume production and deliveries in the second half of 2017. In addition to expanding our vehicle production and deliveries, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters due to economies of scale, material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing. The decreasing trend in cost of manufacturing vehicles is expected to improve total automotive gross margin over time and mitigate some of the higher ramp up costs associated with the launch of Model 3. We have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control over utilization and minimization of scrapping materials. This is also evident through increased product reliability including vehicle, battery and drive units that resulted in a reduction of our warranty expense. In addition, we expect that the acquisition of Grohmann will further increase our production automation and efficiency. In order to accommodate a much larger fleet of customer vehicles as we increase deliveries and to provide timely customer service, we are expanding our sales, service and charging infrastructure worldwide. In particular, we continue to open new Tesla retail and service locations around the world. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 265 sales and service locations, and expect our long-term vehicle sales outside of North America to be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue. As we have less experience in international markets, we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans with respect to timing and expected sales. Energy Generation and Storage Demand We believe that demand for our energy products will continue to increase. We plan to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling solar products in Tesla stores. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we revealed the solar roof product, of which we expect to begin production and installation later in 2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we also announced our second generation energy storage products, Powerpack 2 and Powerwall 2, which offer significant price advantage per kWh and higher energy density. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses We plan to build 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Given this plan, we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures. Our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling, production equipment and construction of the Model 3 production lines, equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory 1, as well as new retail locations, service centers and Supercharger locations. We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $207.2 million and $166.6 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2016, our Supercharger network included 790 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia, and expect such spending to continue to be a minimal portion of total capital spending. During 2017, we expect that this investment will grow our Supercharger network greatly. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of total automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2017, driven by engineering, design, and testing expenses related to Model 3, supplier contracts and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence. In addition, we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of the increased selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage segment. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Automotive Financing Options We offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions. During 2016, we discontinued the resale value guarantee in North America, but continue to offer it in selected European and Asian markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise during fiscal year 2017 total $179.5 million in value. 36 Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. We currently offer vehicle leases in the U.S. directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as well as through a leasing partner. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We also offer financing arrangements through our entities in Canada, Germany and the U.K. Leasing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities (but not for those offered through our leasing partner), we only receive a limited portion of cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings, including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive, our sales, financial results, and cash flow could be negatively impacted. Energy Generation and Storage Financing options Through SolarCity, we offer Solar Loans, whereby a third-party lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system installed by us. We enter into a standard solar energy system sale agreement with the customer. Separately, the customer enters into a loan agreement with one of the third-party lenders, who finances the full purchase price. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. If we are unable to continue to offer third-party financing or other financing alternatives to our customers on competitive terms, our growth may slow and our financial and operating results may be adversely impacted. Gigafactory 1 and Manufacturing We are developing Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules and battery packs in one location for both vehicles and energy storage products. We broke ground on Gigafactory 1 in June 2014, began assembling our energy storage products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015, and began production of lithium-ion battery cells for our energy storage products in the first quarter of 2017. We continue to invest in construction of the building at Gigafactory and in production equipment for battery, module and pack production. Panasonic has agreed to partner with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1 at negotiated prices. As these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within ASC 840, Leases, we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in early 2017. This will result in us recording the value of such assets within property, plant and equipment, net, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will record the value of such assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Based on our current assessment, as of December 31, 2016, approximately $300 million is expected to be recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet during the first quarter of 2017. Although we continue to remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 1, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate. In addition, we continue to expand production capacity at our Fremont Factory and are exploring additional production capacity in Asia and Europe. 37 Gigafactory 2 and Manufacturing Through our acquisition of SolarCity, we have an agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York for the construction of an approximately 1 million square foot manufacturing facility capable of producing 1 gigawatt of solar panels annually on an approximately 88.24 acre site located in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into a Production Pricing Agreement: Phases 1-3 (the Phase 1-3 Agreement) with Panasonic Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America and Sanyo Electronic Co., Ltd (collectively, Panasonic). This agreement provides that Panasonic will manufacture custom photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and that we will purchase certain amounts of PV cells and modules form Panasonic during the 10-year term, with the intent to produce PV cells and modules totaling approximately 1 gigawatt annually beginning in 2019. The terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York, among other things, require us to comply with a number of covenants during the term of the agreement. Any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the Foundation and result in termination of the agreement. Although we continue to remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility, acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Automotive Segment Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including free internet connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network, and free future over the air software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the vehicle, except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third party pricing of similar options, and other information which may be available. Starting in the third quarter of 2016, we started to separately present automotive leasing revenue and related cost of revenue. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees. See “Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee,” “Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “Direct Vehicle Leasing Program” for further details. Services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services, service plans and merchandise, sales of pre-owned Tesla vehicles, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, and sales of non-Tesla vehicle trade-ins. 38 Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee We offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, this program is available only in certain international markets. Under this program, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive leasing revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of December 31, 2016, $179.5 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months. Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840 - Leases. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the long-term portion and deferred revenue for the current portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount, or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program, assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is $855.9 million at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.18 billion and $527.5 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and $289.1 million and $120.5 million recorded in deferred revenue liability. At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be significant changes to their estimated values. Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the North America and Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had deferred $67.2 million and $25.8 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. 39 Maintenance and Service Plans We offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles, provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations. We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods. Energy Generation and Storage Segment For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price, either directly or through the Solar Loan program, revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method. Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as work in progress in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a Solar Loan lender would be recognized as an offset against solar energy systems and components sales revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-50, Customer Payments and Incentives. Revenue for energy storage product sale is recognized when the product is delivered or installed, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems, including energy storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. For incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system, we record revenue as the amounts are earned. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for, in substance, as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or power purchase agreements (the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions) as an element of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased – net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems, and energy generation and storage products we sell. At the time of delivery, we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. 40 These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. For the solar energy systems that we sell, we provide a warranty on the installation and components for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. The manufacturer’s warranty on the solar energy systems’ components, which is typically passed-through to customers, ranges from 5 to 30 years. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles and solar energy systems accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements. Any costs to repair these vehicles and systems are expensed as incurred. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue for Automotive related sale and cost of energy generation and storage revenue for solar energy and storage systems. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities, expected lives and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our CEO (the “2012 CEO Grant”). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date. Each of the ten vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten pre-determined performance milestones and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant. The term of the 2012 CEO Grant is ten years, so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant will be forfeited. In addition, unvested options will be forfeited if our CEO is no longer in that role, whether for cause or otherwise. We measured the fair value of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.65%, expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and dividend yield of 0%. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met. 41 As of December 31, 2016, the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our Board of Directors, and therefore five of ten tranches of the 2012 CEO Grant were vested as of such date: • Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype; • Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype; • Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle; • Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles; and • Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype. As of December 31, 2016, the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement: • Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype; • Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; • Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles; and • Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles. We expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype, which would be achieved upon the determination by our Board of Directors that an eligible prototype has been completed. Candidates for such prototype are among the vehicles that we are currently building as part of our ongoing testing of our Model 3 vehicle design and manufacturing processes. As the above four performance milestones were considered probable of achievement, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $15.8 million, $10.6 million and $25.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, no cash compensation has ever been received by our CEO for his services to the Company. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2016, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. 42 Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, ASC 810 Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity, or VIE, of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that SolarCity enters into to finance the costs of solar energy systems under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The excess of the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities over the fair value of purchase consideration is recorded as gain from bargain purchase in other income and expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and certain tangible assets such as solar energy systems acquired as part of our SolarCity acquisition. Critical estimates in valuing certain tangible and intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Automotive Automotive $ 5,589,007 $ 3,431,587 $ 2,874,448 $ 2,157,420 63 % $ 557,139 19 % Automotive leasing 761,759 309,386 132,564 452,373 146 % 176,822 133 % Services and other 467,972 290,575 187,136 177,397 61 % 103,439 55 % Total automotive revenue 6,818,738 4,031,548 3,194,148 2,787,190 69 % 837,400 26 % Energy generation and storage Energy generation and storage 181,394 14,477 4,208 166,917 1153 % 10,269 244 % Total revenues $ 7,000,132 $ 4,046,025 $ 3,198,356 $ 2,954,107 73 % $ 847,669 27 % Automotive Segment Automotive revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S and Model X vehicles, including internet connectivity, Supercharger access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Services and other revenue consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance services and sales of pre-owned vehicles. 2016 compared to 2015 Automotive revenue increased $2.16 billion, or 63% to $5.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50,700. The increase in volume is primarily due to a full year of Model X deliveries in 2016, as well as increased production and sales of Model S. Further, there was an overall increase in average selling price of 6.1% primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced vehicles compared to Model S. In addition, there is an increase of $133.4 million to $302.3 million of the sale of regulatory credits from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by negative impact from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates. Automotive leasing revenue increased $452.4 million, or 146%, to $761.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $112.6 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees. Service and other revenue increased $177.4 million, or 61%, to $468.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $117.4 million in pre-owned vehicle sales as we received more trade-ins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of $66.6 million as our fleet continues to grow. 2015 compared to 2014 Automotive revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $3.43 billion and $2.87 billion. Automotive leasing revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $309.4 million and $132.6 million. The increase of automotive revenue and automotive leasing revenue was primarily driven by the ramp in vehicle deliveries. Service and other revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $290.6 million and $187.1 million, related primarily to increases in pre-owned vehicle sales and maintenance service revenue. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products, leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and power purchase agreements and the sale of solar energy systems incentives. 44 Energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.9 million, or 1,153%, primarily due to $84.1 million as a result of the inclusion of revenue from SolarCity from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016, as well as an increase of $82.8 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale projects such as Southern California Edison Mira Loma substation.

Cost of automotive revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and energy products, costs associated with providing maintenance services, and costs to acquire and certify pre-owned vehicles. 2016 compared to 2015 Cost of automotive revenues increased $1.63 billion, or 62%, to $4.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a full year of Model X deliveries as well as increased deliveries for Model S. In addition, the increase is due to product mix as Model X has a higher cost structure than Model S. The increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of $20.0 million resulting from better vehicle reliability. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $298.6 million, or 163%, to $482.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $114.3 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees. Cost of services and other revenue increased $185.5 million, or 65%, to $472.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $120.8 million in cost of pre-owned vehicle sales due to increase in volume, and an increase of $64.9 million in cost to provide maintenance service as our fleet continues to grow. 45 Gross profit for the Automotive segment increased from $921.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.60 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Automotive gross margin increased from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes, partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance. 2015 Compared to 2014 Cost of automotive revenues increased $581.6 million, or 28%, to $2.64 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased Model S deliveries. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $96.0 million, or 110%, to $183.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees as volume of Model S increased. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, costs of services and other revenue were $286.9 million and $166.9 million. The increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater pre-owned vehicle sales and increased maintenance and repair services. Gross profit for the automotive segment increased from $881.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to $921.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 22.9% and 27.6%. The lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift, as a greater percentage of sales were derived from vehicle models with lower average selling prices, and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor Model S vehicles and start of Model X production, obsolete inventory and lower ZEV credits revenue. This margin decrease was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross margin and from material cost savings. Services and other gross margin were also down year over year, primarily driven by a planned price reduction for powertrain sales to Daimler. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs, overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.0 million to $178.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is due to an increase of $67.0 million as a result of the inclusion of SolarCity’s financial results from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue in 2014 was insignificant. Gross profit and related margin for energy generation and storage was also insignificant in all periods presented. Research and Development Expenses Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Research and development $ 834,408 $ 717,900 $ 464,700 116,508 16 % 253,200 54 % As a percentage of revenues 11.9 % 17.7 % 14.5 % Research and development (R&D) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses increased $116.5 million, or 16%, to $834.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $116.5 million was primarily due to a $78.2 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 15% headcount increase as we expanded our vehicle business in the U.S. and internationally, and a $65.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. This is partially offset by a $25.9 million decrease in expensed materials related to our Model X development, which was primarily incurred in 2015. The overall increase also includes $11.0 million related to SolarCity. 46 R&D expenses increased $253.2 million, or 54%, to $717.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in R&D expenses consisted primarily of a $93.9 million increase in expensed materials primarily to support our Model X development and Model S improvements, a $75.9 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $30.6 million increase in facilities and depreciation costs, a $20.1 million increase in costs related to Model X, autopilot and dual motor powertrain engineering, design and testing activities and a $22.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,432,189 $ 922,232 $ 603,660 509,957 55 % 318,572 53 % As a percentage of revenues 20.5 % 22.8 % 18.9 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services. SG&A expenses increased $510.0 million, or 55%, to $1.43 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $247.2 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 61.3% increase in headcount as we expanded our business in the U.S. and internationally, a $91.0 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, and a $58.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and existing employees. The increase includes $74.3 million related to SolarCity. SG&A expenses increased $318.6 million, or 53%, to $922.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our SG&A expenses consisted primarily of a $138.4 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales, service and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, $126.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, a $41.8 million increase in professional and outside services costs, and a $12.2 million increase in stock based compensation. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (198,810 ) $ (118,851 ) $ (100,886 ) (79,959 ) 67 % (17,965 ) 18 % As a percentage of revenues -2.8 % -2.9 % -3.2 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $80.0 million, or 67%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $33.1 million increase in interest expense on vehicles sales that we account for as collateralized borrowing, a $28.5 million increase in interest expense on build-to-suit leases and a $22.0 million increase in interest expense associated with SolarCity’s indebtedness, financing obligations and capital lease obligations. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $118.9 million, as compared to $100.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase as compared to the same periods in 2014 was due to the issuance of $920.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.38 billion aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes during the first half of 2014. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Other income (expense), net $ 111,272 $ (41,652 ) $ 1,813 152,924 -367 % (43,465 ) -2397 % As a percentage of revenues 1.6 % -1.0 % * * = less than 1% 47 Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Additionally, other income (expense), net, includes a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income, net, was $111.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to other expense, net, of $41.7 million during the same period in 2015, representing increases of $152.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity of $88.7 million and a loss on conversion of our 2018 Notes of $7.2 million. The remainder of the change in other income (expense), net, was primarily result of fluctuations in gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange. Other expense was $41.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to an income of $1.8 million during the same period in 2014. Fluctuations in other income (expense) from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange of ($45.6) million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Foreign currency losses during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro, Norwegian krone, Canadian dollars, and Chinese yuan. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 26,698 $ 13,039 $ 9,404 13,659 105 % 3,635 39 % As a percentage of loss before income taxes -3.6 % -1.5 % -3.3 % Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $26.7 million, $13.0 million, and $9.4 million. The increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests The net loss allocation to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $98.1 million and was related to SolarCity’s financing arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.39 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents, which included $2.2 billion of money market funds. This balance included $969.0 million drawn under our asset based line of credit and $390.0 million drawn under our Warehouse Agreement which we entered into in August 2016 to support the Tesla Finance direct leasing program. In addition, the balance included $213.5 million of cash assumed as part of the SolarCity acquisition. Amounts held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $827.1 million as of December 31 2016, and consisted primarily of Euro, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollars. Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, proceeds from retail financing activities, and sales of energy generation and storage products. In addition, through our acquisition of SolarCity, we expect to generate additional liquidity through the sale of solar energy systems to customers and financing funds created to monetize the cash flows, tax attributes and other incentives generated by solar energy systems deployed under operating leases or power purchase agreements. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans. We may raise funds in the future, including through potential equity or debt offerings, subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. The amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and will vary based on a number of factors, including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity. These current sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development projects, the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned Model 3; the continued construction of Gigafactory 1; and the expansion of our retail stores, service centers and Supercharger network. We are planning to produce 500,000 total vehicles in 2018, which is approximately double our prior growth plan. We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs. We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017. 48 As part of the SolarCity acquisition, we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory 2 and other operations within the State of New York over the 10-year term of the agreement, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we have the following credit facilities available: • Senior secured asset-based revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) up to the lesser of $1.20 billion, or the value of the secured assets as determined monthly pursuant to the Credit Agreement, reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding issued under the Credit Agreement, As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding amount under the Credit Agreement is $969.0 million. • Loan and Security Agreement (“Warehouse Agreement”) up to the lesser of $600.0 million or the amount based on the securitization value of certain vehicle leases originated by Tesla. As of December 31, 2016, the securitization value of such leases was sufficient to support an outstanding amount under the Warehouse Agreement of $390.0 million. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of SolarCity, additional credit facilities are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016. SolarCity has financing fund commitments from several fund investors that can be drawn in the future upon the achievement of specific funding criteria. As of December 31, 2016, SolarCity had entered into 63 financing funds that had a total of $481.4 million of undrawn committed capital. For additional details regarding our and SolarCity’s recourse and non-recourse indebtedness, refer to Note 13, Convertible and Long-term Debt Obligations, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash used in operating activities $ (123,829 ) $ (524,499 ) $ (57,337 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1,416,430 ) (1,673,551 ) (990,444 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 3,743,976 1,523,523 2,143,130 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Our operating cash inflows include cash from sales and leases of our vehicles, customer deposits for vehicles, including Model 3, sales of regulatory credits, sales of powertrain components and systems, and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating leases and interest expense on our financings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $123.8 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $773.0 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expands, an increase in deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicle deliveries with resale value guarantee increased, an increase in customer deposits of 388.4 million primarily as a result of Model 3 reservations and an increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expand our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantees. Cash used in operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $1.34 billion, which primarily consisted of depreciation expense of $947.1 million and stock-based compensation of $334.2 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $88.7 million related to the SolarCity acquisition. 49 During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in operating activities was $524.5 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $888.7 million, and an increase of inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.57 billion as we expanded our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in resale value guarantees of $442.3 million and deferred revenue of $322.2 million as the number vehicles with resale value guarantee increased. Cash used by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $857.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in operating activities was $57.3 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $294.0 million, and an increase of inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.05 billion as we expanded our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in resale value guarantee of $249.5 million and deferred revenue of $209.7 million as the number vehicles with resale value guarantee increased. Cash used by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $493.5 million. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to an increase in overall inventory to support growth, and increase in operating lease vehicles, partially offset by proceeds from sales, and higher operating expenses in R&D and SG&A. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in manufacturing equipment and tooling, the continued construction of our Gigafactory, and our stores, service centers and Supercharger network infrastructure. Cash used in investing activities was $1.42 billion, $1.67 billion and $990.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.28 billion, $1.63 billion and $969.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, we increased our restricted cash of $206.1 million as a result of the assumed restricted cash from the SolarCity acquisition. The decreases in cash flows from investing activities in 2016 was partially offset by the assumed cash of $213.5 million as a result of the SolarCity acquisition. In 2014, we began construction of Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. In 2016, we used cash of $455.3 million towards Gigafactory 1 construction and expect to spend a total of approximately $770.0 million during 2017. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.74 billion, $1.52 billion and $2.14 billion. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of $1.70 billion net proceeds from our May 2016 public offering of 7,915,004 shares of common stock, $995.4 million of proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, and proceeds from collateralized borrowing of $769.7 million. The net proceeds from issuance of debt during 2016 primarily consisted of the following: $834.0 million of net borrowing under the Asset-Based Credit Facility, $390.0 million borrowing under the Warehouse Agreement Facility, partially offset by settlement of $454.7 million for certain conversion of our 2018 Notes. Further, we also received $201.5 million of proceeds from investment by fund investors and paid distributions to fund investors of $21.3 million. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $738.3 million net proceeds from August 2015 public offering of 3,099,173 shares of common stock and $568.7 million received from vehicle sales to our bank leasing partners. The decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to $2.1 billion in net proceeds received in 2014 from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes. Common Stock Offering In May 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 7,915,004 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. In August 2015, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,099,173 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $738.3 million (which includes 82,645 shares or $20.0 million sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. 50 The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Operating lease obligations (1) $ 925,977 $ 165,457 $ 150,925 $ 125,148 $ 102,804 $ 88,950 $ 292,693 Capital lease obligations, including interest 122,573 38,712 33,730 23,793 7,333 2,746 16,259 Purchase obligations (2)(3) 7,293,507 2,755,762 92,625 79,239 3,871 3,831 15,471 Long-term debt (4)(5) 8,198,241 1,074,553 1,333,675 1,817,434 1,229,656 1,634,897 1,108,026 Total $ 16,540,298 $ 4,034,484 $ 1,610,955 $ 2,045,614 $ 1,343,664 $ 1,730,424 $ 1,432,449 (1) The operating lease obligations amount includes $257.5 million recorded as other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with built-to-suit accounting. (2) Amounts do not include future cash payments for purchase obligations which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2016. (3) These totals represent a quantification of aggregate amounts pursuant to purchase orders issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2016, as well as any other estimable and calculable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2016, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date, and/or amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to unsatisfied market conditions and contingent events. Where the timing of payments are not known or estimable, we have included the amount only in the total column. If contracts where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements were terminated on or prior to December 31, 2016, our obligations under such contracts would have been substantially lower. (4) During the fourth quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2017. As such, we classified the $205.0 million principal balance of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016 and have included related contractual payments in the year ended December 31, 2017 category in the table above. (5) Long-term debt reported above includes SolarCity’s total consolidated indebtedness of $3.58 billion as of December 31, 2016, representing outstanding recourse indebtedness of $1.62 billion and non-recourse indebtedness of $1.95 billion. Long-term debt reported above also includes our remaining non-recourse indebtedness of $457.3 million. Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to the general assets of the debt issuer. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse only to specified assets of the debt issuer and/or its subsidiaries. SolarCity’s non-recourse credit facilities have been structured to be supported solely by the solar assets that are pledged as collateral, and, to date, have not experienced any failure to pay such non-recourse indebtedness. The contractual obligations table above excludes uncertain tax benefits of approximately $198.3 million that are disclosed in Note 16 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements because these uncertain tax positions, if recognized, would be an adjustment to the deferred tax assets. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the U.S. dollar. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances. As of December 31, 2016, our largest currency exposures are from the Euro, Japanese yen, and British Pounds. We recorded foreign exchange gain of $26.1 million in other income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. 51 We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of December 31, 2016 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $41.6 million, recorded to other income (expense), net, principally from intercompany and cash balances. In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss. We reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are considered effective hedges, we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts. Ineffectiveness related to the hedges is immaterial as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts, and had recorded a cumulative gain of $5.6 million to AOCI related to our outstanding foreign currency cash flow hedges. Interest Rate Risk We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. A significant portion of our cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash equivalents as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short-term nature of our cash equivalents. We are exposed to interest rate risk for our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates plus a specified margin. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on certain floating-rate debt. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In particular, a hypothetical 10% change in our interest rates would have immaterial impact on interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. 52",2023-12-31 03:12:57.649304
1318605,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and 2017 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to our products. Automotive Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle, which are our highest-performance vehicles, and our Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which we began to produce and deliver in the second half of 2017. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options, Internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In addition, we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including those we unveiled in 2017 – an electric semi-truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster. In 2017, our vehicle production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies, and vehicle production volume increased by 20% year-over-year. Additionally, we delivered 101,420 Model S and Model X vehicles and 1,764 Model 3 vehicles in 2017. Energy Generation and Storage We lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers. We have partnered with Panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture PV cells, thus enabling high volume integrated tile and PV cell production at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York. We also recently commenced Solar Roof production at Gigafactory 2. Our energy storage products, which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall mostly for residential applications and Powerpack for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications. In late 2017, we completed installation of the largest battery in the world in South Australia. This battery delivers electricity during peak hours to help maintain the reliable operation of South Australia’s electrical infrastructure. In 2017, we deployed 358 MWh of energy storage products and 523 MW of solar energy generation. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2018 Outlook Automotive Demand, Production and Deliveries We drive demand for our vehicles by continually improving our vehicles through over-the-air software updates, expanding our retail, service and charging infrastructure, and by periodically developing and introducing new passenger and commercial electric vehicle variants and models. Our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive industry, and having cutting edge robotic expertise in-house is at the core of that goal. Our recent acquisitions of advanced automation companies have added to our talent base and are helping us increase vehicle production rates more effectively. The worldwide automotive market for alternative fuel vehicles and self-driving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so. Many companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand, and in some cases fully transition to, production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles, and to also develop self-driving technologies. We welcome the acceleration of the world’s transition to sustainable transport. Nonetheless, we believe that the unique features of our vehicles, our constant innovation, our growing brand, the increased affordability introduced with Model 3, our global Supercharger network and our future vehicles, will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets. 39 We expect Model S and Model X deliveries to be approximately 100,000 in total in 2018, constrained by the supply of cells with the 18650 form factor used in those vehicles. As our sales network continues to expand to new markets in 2018, we believe vehicle orders should continue to grow. With demand outpacing production, we plan to optimize the trim and option mix in order to optimize revenue and gross margin. We have made significant and sustained progress in the production processes of Model S and Model X, and we will continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies for these vehicles in 2018. We expect Model 3 production and deliveries to grow significantly in 2018. The initial phase of manufacturing any new vehicle is always challenging, and the Model 3 production ramp has been no exception, particularly given our focus on highly automated manufacturing processes, that we expect will ultimately result in higher volumes at significantly lower costs. Model 3 volume production has been less than we initially anticipated due to production bottlenecks, with the battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1 being the primary production constraint to date, although future bottlenecks in other areas of vehicle manufacturing may surface. We have redirected our best engineering talent to Gigafactory 1 to fine-tune the automated processes and related robotic programming not only to address the challenges we have experienced but also to continue evaluating our overall manufacturing process for efficiencies. Based on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate. We are also making strides in other aspects of our vehicle production, deliveries and customer infrastructure. For example, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles due to economies of scale, material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing and equipment utilization. We have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control for Model S and Model X. We have also seen improved product reliability in our vehicles, batteries and drive units. Likewise, we may experience infrastructure constraints and customer experience issues relating to vehicle deliveries, but are trying to address such issues by opening additional delivery and service centers to scale the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver. Generally, as sales of Tesla vehicles ramp in 2018, we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail, locations, service centers and delivery hubs around the world, we plan continue to expand our mobile repair services, and we plan to significantly increase the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally with the goal of remaining ahead of the Model 3 ramp. We are also making progress with our self-driving technology. An overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has been completed, which has enabled a step-change improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities. The aggregate of such data and learnings, which we refer to as our “neural net,” is able to collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before, enabling us to rollout a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment We are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products, including by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling these products in Tesla stores with dedicated energy product sales personnel and leveraging channel partnerships. Moreover, we have deemphasized absolute volume growth for our solar products, and we have instead prioritized projects for cash generation and profitability. Solar Roof installations will initially ramp slowly in the first half of 2018. As Solar Roof is truly the first-of-its-kind and there is significant complexity in both its manufacturing and installation, we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace to 40 ensure reliability and a great customer experience. With demand outpacing production, we expect our backlog to remain in excess of one year for the next several quarters. We expect energy storage products to experience significant growth, with our aim being to at least triple our sales in 2018. We are ramping up production for these products at our Gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters, but demand is greater than our current production capacity for energy storage. We expect energy generation and storage gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 as we enter the year with a backlog of higher-margin commercial solar projects and a more profitable energy storage business due to overall cost and manufacturing efficiencies from scaling. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017, with the majority of the spending to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, and for building additional stores, service centers and Superchargers. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017, although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency. The growth in operating expense will mainly be driven by engineering, design and testing of new products or changes to existing products and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence. In addition, we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage business. We are seeking stockholder approval for a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones. If Tesla stockholders approve the award, we would incur significant additional stock-based compensation expense over the term of the award as each performance milestone becomes probable of vesting. Automotive Financing Options We offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all direct customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, this program is available only in certain international markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31, 2017 totaled $375.7 million in value. We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Through 2017, we only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. We currently offer vehicle leases in the U.S. for Model S and Model X directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as well as through leasing partners. Leasing through Tesla Finance is available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We also offer financing arrangements through our entities in Canada, Germany and the 41 United Kingdom. Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities, we assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings, including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Energy Generation and Storage Financing Options We offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and power purchase agreements. In both structures, we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee. In the lease structure, this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee. In the power purchase agreement structure, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces. The leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years with a renewal option, and generally when there is no upfront prepayment, the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations. For customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems, we also offer solar loans, whereby a third-party lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed, installed and serviced by us. We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer. Separately, the customer enters into a loan agreement with a third-party lender, who finances the full purchase price. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. Gigafactory 1 We continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules, battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products. We also continue to invest in the future expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in production equipment for battery cell, module and pack production. Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As these terms convey to us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, Leases, their production equipment, we consider them to be leased assets when production commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply similar accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $473.3 million on the consolidated balance sheet. While we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp. For example, we have experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory 1, which has negatively affected our production of Model 3. While we continue to make progress to resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate. Gigafactory 2 We have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory capable of producing at least 1.0 gigawatts of solar cells annually in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into an agreement with Panasonic under which it will manufacture custom PV cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and we will purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10-year term. 42 The terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants, and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the agreement. Although we remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility, acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits. Other Manufacturing In addition, we continue to expand production capacity at our Tesla Factory and are exploring additional production capacity in Asia and Europe. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Automotive Segment Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance, including free internet connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network and future free over-the-air software updates. These other elements are valued on a stand-alone basis, and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the vehicle, except for internet connectivity, which is over the free four-year period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and were immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender, when we arrange the financing, would be recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-50, Customer Payments and Incentives. Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees. See “Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee,” “Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “Direct Vehicle Leasing Program” for further details. Service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services, service plans, merchandise, sales of used Tesla vehicles, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of non-Tesla vehicle trade-ins. 43 Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee Prior to June 30, 2016, we offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Since June 30, 2016, this program is available only in certain international markets. Under this program, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a determined resale value. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the long-term portion and deferred revenue for the current portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the North America and Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases, and we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. 44 Maintenance and Service Plans We offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to four years or up to 50,000 miles, provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations. We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods. Energy Generation and Storage Segment For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price, either directly or through the solar loan program, revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method. Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as work-in-progress in the consolidated balance sheet. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against energy generation and storage revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-50, Customer Payments and Incentives. Revenue from an energy storage product sale is recognized when the product has been delivered, installed and accepted by the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems, including energy storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. For incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system, we record revenue as the amounts are earned. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for, in substance, as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which are recognized as revenue over the lease term, as well as the fees charged for remote monitoring service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs (i.e. the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions) as an element of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. 45 We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures). For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and 46 administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 (and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months), we consider the accounting of deferred tax re-measurements and other items, such as state tax considerations, to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. We do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not 47 considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. When determining such fair values, we make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates. Our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Furthermore, our estimates might change as additional information becomes available, as more fully discussed in Note 3, Business Combinations, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 48 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Automotive sales $ 8,534,752 $ 5,589,007 $ 3,431,587 $ 2,945,745 53 % $ 2,157,420 63 % Automotive leasing 1,106,548 761,759 309,386 344,789 45 % 452,373 146 % Total automotive revenues 9,641,300 6,350,766 3,740,973 3,290,534 52 % 2,609,793 70 % Services and other 1,001,185 467,972 290,575 533,213 114 % 177,397 61 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 10,642,485 6,818,738 4,031,548 3,823,747 56 % 2,787,190 69 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 1,116,266 181,394 14,477 934,872 515 % 166,917 1153 % Total revenues $ 11,758,751 $ 7,000,132 $ 4,046,025 $ 4,758,619 68 % $ 2,954,107 73 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles, including internet connectivity, Supercharger access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We do not yet offer leasing for Model 3 vehicles. Services and other revenue consists of maintenance services, sales of used vehicles and sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers. 2017 Compared to 2016 Automotive sales revenue increased $2.95 billion, or 53%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily related to a 58% increase in deliveries to 80,060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X, at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period, as well as sales of 1,764 Model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally there was an increase of $58.0 million to $360.3 million in sales of regulatory credits offset partially by additional deferrals of autopilot 2.0 revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. Automotive leasing revenue increased $344.8 million, or 45%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an approximately 30% increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an increase of $23.4 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Service and other revenue increased $533.2 million, or 114%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our trade-in program. Additionally, there was a $41.1 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from Grohmann, which we acquired on January 3, 2017, and a $68.4 million increase in maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended December 31, 2017. 49 2016 Compared to 2015 Automotive sales revenue increased $2.16 billion, or 63% to $5.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50,700. The increase in volume is primarily due to a full-year of Model X deliveries in 2016, as well as increased production and sales of Model S. Further, there was an overall increase in average selling price of 6% primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced vehicles compared to Model S. In addition, there is an increase of $133.4 million to $302.3 million of the sale of regulatory credits from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by negative impact from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates. Automotive leasing revenue increased $452.4 million, or 146%, to $761.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $112.6 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees. Service and other revenue increased $177.4 million, or 61%, to $468.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $117.4 million in used vehicle sales as we received more trade-ins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of $66.6 million as our fleet continues to grow. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products, leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of solar energy systems incentives. 2017 Compared to 2016 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $934.9 million, or 515%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, predominantly due to the inclusion of the full-year of revenue from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21, 2016. 2016 Compared to 2015 Energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.9 million, or 1,153%, primarily due to $84.1 million as a result of the inclusion of revenue from SolarCity from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016, as well as an increase of $82.8 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale projects such as Southern California Edison Mira Loma substation. 50 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 6,724,480 $ 4,268,087 $ 2,639,926 $ 2,456,393 58 % $ 1,628,161 62 % Automotive leasing 708,224 481,994 183,376 226,230 47 % 298,618 163 % Total automotive cost of revenues 7,432,704 4,750,081 2,823,302 2,682,623 56 % 1,926,779 68 % Services and other 1,229,022 472,462 286,933 756,560 160 % 185,529 65 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenue 8,661,726 5,222,543 3,110,235 3,439,183 66 % 2,112,308 68 % Energy generation and storage segment 874,538 178,332 12,287 696,206 390 % 166,045 1351 % Total cost of revenues $ 9,536,264 $ 5,400,875 $ 3,122,522 $ 4,135,389 77 % $ 2,278,353 73 % Gross profit total automotive $ 2,208,596 $ 1,600,685 $ 917,671 Gross margin total automotive 23 % 25 % 25 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 1,980,759 $ 1,596,195 $ 921,313 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 19 % 23 % 23 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 241,728 $ 3,062 $ 2,190 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 22 % 2 % 15 % Total gross profit $ 2,222,487 $ 1,599,257 $ 923,503 Total gross margin 19 % 23 % 23 % 51 Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, costs associated with providing maintenance services and costs to acquire and certify used vehicles. 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of automotive sales revenues increased $2.46 billion, or 58%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to a 58% increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X, as well as the commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $226.2 million, or 47%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an approximately 30% increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an increase of $23.4 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees. Cost of services and other revenue increased $756.6 million, or 160%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25% to 23% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps, higher current period early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees, as compared to the same period in the prior year, contributed to the lower gross margin. Lower material and manufacturing costs for Model S and Model X, as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 2.0 revenue in the current period partially offset the overall decrease. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 23% to 19% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive, as explained above, as well as higher costs of maintenance service. 2016 Compared to 2015 Cost of automotive revenues increased $1.63 billion, or 62%, to $4.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a full-year of Model X deliveries as well as increased deliveries for Model S. In addition, the increase is due to product mix as Model X has a higher cost structure than Model S. The increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of $20.0 million resulting from better vehicle reliability. 52 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $298.6 million, or 163%, to $482.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $114.3 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees. Cost of services and other revenue increased $185.5 million, or 65%, to $472.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $120.8 million in cost of used vehicle sales due to increase in volume, and an increase of $64.9 million in cost to provide maintenance service as our fleet continues to grow. Gross margin for total automotive remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit for total automotive & services and other segment increased from $921.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.60 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment increased from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes, partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs, overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems. 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $696.2 million, or 390%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to the inclusion of the full-year of costs from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21, 2016. Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2% to 22% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was predominantly due to the inclusion of the full-year of revenue and costs from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity. 2016 Compared to 2015 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.0 million to $178.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to an increase of $67.0 million as a result of the inclusion of SolarCity’s financial results from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products. Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Research and development $ 1,378,073 $ 834,408 $ 717,900 $ 543,665 65 % $ 116,508 16 % As a percentage of revenues 12 % 12 % 18 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. 53 R&D expenses increased $543.7 million, or 65%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $274.9 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses, and a $44.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, there were increases in facilities expenses, depreciation expenses, professional and outside service expenses and expensed materials to support the development of future products. R&D expenses increased $116.5 million, or 16%, to $834.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $116.5 million was primarily due to a $78.2 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 15% headcount increase as we expanded our vehicle business in the U.S. and internationally, and a $65.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. This is partially offset by a $25.9 million decrease in expensed materials related to our Model X development, which was primarily incurred in 2015. The overall increase also includes $11.0 million related to SolarCity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 2,476,500 $ 1,432,189 $ 922,232 $ 1,044,311 73 % $ 509,957 55 % As a percentage of revenues 21 % 20 % 23 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses increased $1.04 billion, or 73%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $524.0 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses, and a $64.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, the increase was due to a $310.6 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a $140.6 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business. SG&A expenses increased $510.0 million, or 55%, to $1.43 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $247.2 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 61% increase in headcount as we expanded our business in the U.S. and internationally, a $91.0 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, and a $58.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and existing employees. The increase includes $74.3 million related to SolarCity. 54 Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (471,259 ) $ (198,810 ) $ (118,851 ) $ (272,449 ) 137 % $ (79,959 ) 67 % As a percentage of revenues 4 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $272.4 million, or 137%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the full-year of interest expense from SolarCity of $185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year mainly due to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the Senior Notes due in 2025, both of which we issued during 2017. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $80.0 million, or 67%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $33.1 million increase in interest expense on vehicles sales that we account for as collateralized borrowing, a $28.5 million increase in interest expense on build-to-suit leases and a $22.0 million increase in interest expense associated with SolarCity’s indebtedness, financing obligations and capital lease obligations. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Other income (expense), net $ (125,373 ) $ 111,272 $ (41,652 ) $ (236,645 ) -213 % $ 152,924 -367 % As a percentage of revenues -1 % 2 % -1 % Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Additionally, other income (expense), net, includes a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income (expense), net, decreased by $236.7 million, or 213%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of SolarCity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Other income, net, increased by $152.9 million as we recognized a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity of $88.7 million and a loss on conversion of our 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 of $7.2 million. The remainder of the change in other income (expense), net, was primarily result of fluctuations in gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 31,546 $ 26,698 $ 13,039 $ 4,848 18 % $ 13,659 105 % Effective tax rate -1 % -4 % -1 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $4.9 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions, partially offset by $10.5 million of future U.S. alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which previously had an associated valuation allowance. 55 Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $26.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Our net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, we had $3.37 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $521.5 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Norwegian kroner. Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects, investments in tooling and manufacturing equipment for the production ramp of Model 3, the continued construction of Gigafactory 1 and the continued expansion of our retail stores, service centers, mobile repair services and Supercharger network. We are growing our vehicle manufacturing capacity primarily to fulfill Model 3 production at 5,000 vehicles per week and, in a later phase, to 10,000 vehicles per week. Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017. We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory 2 and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, stores, service centers, delivery centers and Supercharger network. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. In addition, we had $2.04 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds, some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down. For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 13, Convertible and Long-Term Debt Obligations, and Note 18, VIE Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Net cash used in operating activities $ (60,654 ) $ (123,829 ) $ (524,499 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (4,418,967 ) $ (1,416,430 ) $ (1,673,551 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 4,414,864 $ 3,743,976 $ 1,523,523 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, lease payments directly from customers, customer deposits, sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our 56 payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $63.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $197.3 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $134.1 million. The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of $773.0 million, the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expanded, the increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9 million and deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of $388.4 million primarily due to Model 3 reservations. These increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of $888.7 million and the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.57 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee. These increases were partially offset by the increase in resale value guarantees of $442.3 million and deferred revenue of $322.2 million as the number vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $4.08 billion during 2017, $1.44 billion during 2016 and $1.63 billion during 2015. Capital expenditures during 2017 were from $3.41 billion of purchases of property and equipment (mainly for Model 3 production) and $666.5 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers. We also paid $114.5 million, net of the cash acquired, for acquisitions in 2017. In 2014, we began construction of Gigafactory 1. During 2017, we used cash of $1.45 billion towards Gigafactory 1 construction. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of $966.4 million from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, $1.77 billion from the issuance of the Senior Notes due in 2025 and $400.2 million from our March 2017 public offering of common stock, net of underwriter fees. However, we paid $151.2 million for the purchase of bond hedges net of the amount we received from the sale of warrants. Furthermore, we received $511.3 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings and $527.5 million of net proceeds from fund investors. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of $1.70 billion from our May 2016 public offering of common stock, net of underwriter fees, $995.4 million of proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments and $769.7 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings. The net proceeds from issuances of debt consisted primarily of $834.0 million of net borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement and $390.0 million of borrowings under the vehicle lease-backed loan and security agreement entered into in 2016, partially offset by settlements of $454.7 million for certain conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018. Furthermore, we received $180.3 million of net proceeds from fund investors. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $730.0 million from our August 2015 public offering of common stock and $568.7 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings. 57 Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2017, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Operating lease obligations $ 1,317,226 $ 224,630 $ 204,335 $ 175,612 $ 156,552 $ 130,802 $ 425,295 Capital lease obligations, including interest 785,215 127,180 137,313 167,281 138,042 133,772 81,627 Purchase obligations (1) 17,525,445 2,761,819 2,279,682 3,484,953 3,433,787 3,435,956 2,129,248 Long-term debt (2) 11,797,022 2,506,499 2,173,097 413,430 1,798,676 1,582,240 3,323,080 Total $ 31,424,908 $ 5,620,128 $ 4,794,427 $ 4,241,276 $ 5,527,057 $ 5,282,770 $ 5,959,250 (1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $1.18 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2017 and (ii) $16.34 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells to be produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory 1, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2017, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date or, where applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2017. (2) Long-term debt includes our non-recourse indebtedness of $ 2.93 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets of our subsidiaries. The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $191.0 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our foreign operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the U.S. dollar. Upon consolidation, as foreign currency exchange rates vary, revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted, and we may record significant gains or losses on the re-measurement of our monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances. As of December 31, 2017, our largest foreign currency exposures were from the euro, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone. 58 We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These reasonably possible adverse changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as of December 31, 2017 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of $116.0 million. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $7.6 million. 59",2023-12-31 03:12:54.808177
1318605,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and 2018 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to our products. Automotive Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV, which are our highest-performance vehicles, and our Model 3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options, internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In addition, we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including Model Y, Tesla Semi, a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster. In 2018, we continued to scale our automotive operations, particularly our ramp of Model 3, and achieved total production of 254,530 vehicles and delivered 245,506 vehicles, representing year-over-year increases of approximately 152% and 138%, respectively. Energy Generation and Storage We lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers, and are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive, integrated styling. Our energy storage products, which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications. During 2018, we deployed 1.04 GWh of energy storage products, nearly tripling our 358 MWh of energy storage deployments during 2017. We also deployed 326 megawatts (“MW”) of solar energy generation during 2018. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2019 Outlook Automotive Demand, Production and Deliveries Our goal is to produce the world’s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible with a priority on workplace health and safety. The worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and self-driving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so. A growing number of companies, including established automakers, have announced plans to expand, and in some cases fully transition to, production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles, and/or to develop self-driving technologies. However, we believe that the unique features of our vehicles, the safety aspects of each of our vehicles, our constant innovation, our growing brand, the increased affordability introduced with Model 3, the innovation and expansion of our global retail, service and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets. 42 Model 3 was the best-selling premium vehicle in the United States in 2018. Vehicles traded in to us by Model 3 customers continue to suggest the existence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of mid-sized premium sedans. Moreover, as we have offered only the long-range, mid-range and performance variants of Model 3 thus far, we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of less expensive variants, such as a version with a base price of $35,000 that we intend to offer in the future, and additional financing options. We commenced in January 2019 production of Model 3 for Europe and China, each of which we believe has a much larger mid-sized premium sedan market than North America, where we have exclusively delivered Model 3 to date. We also believe that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain technology, as our vehicles’ EPA-rated range per kWh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term, and we have the ability to improve our vehicles through over-the-air software updates. We are producing variants (including regional versions) of Model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them, however, and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times associated with procuring certain parts. If our Model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing planned additional variants, including as we begin offering Model 3 in new markets, we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce. We may also be impacted by trade policies, political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies. In addition, the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the U.S. was reduced to $3,750 for any Tesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019, and will be further reduced to $1,875 for each Tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth quarter of 2019 and to $0 for each Tesla vehicle delivered thereafter. We believe that this phase-out likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit. In the long run, we do not expect a meaningful impact to our sales in the U.S., as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives. Globally, we are also working to, and in some cases have already begun to, increase the value proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing arrangements over time. For example, we intend to introduce leasing options for Model 3. Our Model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018, and we expect to continue to grow Model 3 production to a sustained rate of 7,000 vehicles per week at our Tesla Factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries. We remain focused on further cost improvements and on increasing the affordability of Model 3. Furthermore, in January 2019 we commenced construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai in China. We expect to build a production process that is optimized and simplified for Model 3 production, comprised of stamping, body joining and paint shops and general assembly, at Gigafactory Shanghai to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 for China by the end of 2019. We believe that the efficiencies of local production, as well as avoiding certain tariffs on U.S.-manufactured vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicles in the world. Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai, our goal is to be able to produce 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis, and an annualized output rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. However, the timeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3 production cost-effectively will require that we timely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp, and establish sustained supplier capacity, including locally at Gigafactory Shanghai. We also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kWh versions of Model S and Model X to focus on longer range versions of our highest-performance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from Model 3. We have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these models, and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the production hours for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output as necessary. As Model S and Model X are produced in the U.S., for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties on components sourced from China, as well as by tariffs on vehicles exported to China, although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to North America and Europe, if necessary. 43 Advancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains a top priority. Delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were challenging during 2018, but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction, including by purchasing our own car-hauling trucks. We are also expanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet, including by growing our service locations and Mobile Service fleet, moving to two-shift operations at service centers where needed, and optimizing our parts distribution network. We are also updating the Tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments in order to increase customer convenience. As sales of Tesla vehicles ramp further, we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail locations, service centers and body shops around the world, and we plan to continue to expand our Mobile Service fleet. We also plan to continue to significantly increase the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally, as well as evolve our Supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing our related costs. However, we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing number of vehicles, and we have only limited experience with this at scale, particularly in markets outside of North America. Moreover, if our growing fleet of customer vehicles, particularly Model 3, experiences unexpected reliability issues, it could overburden our servicing capabilities. Finally, we are making progress with our self-driving technology, as well as the Autopilot features in our vehicles. Our neural net and functionality continue to improve, and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates. Recently, we launched a “Navigate on Autopilot” feature that allows enabled Tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver input to change lanes, transition between freeways and exit freeways. While we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control, our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy. Additionally, there is growing competition from other automobile and technology companies in the area of self-driving. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment We are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products, transitioning away from former channel partners and shifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in Tesla stores and on our website and through cross-selling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners. As we continue to implement this strategy, we expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year, including through cross-selling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners. Our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and profitability, rather than absolute volume growth, such as by reducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing residential installations that are combined with our energy storage products. We are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product, and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019. We expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth, and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to over 2 GWh in 2019. We see opportunities in North America as well as in Australia and Europe, where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates, as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability. We are continuing to ramp production for these products at Gigafactory 1, including through a new production line, and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $2.5 billion, mostly to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, and the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y, which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020, as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations, service centers, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger stations. Generally, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency. In addition, due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency, we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10% from 2018. 44 In March 2018, our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). Consequently, we may incur significant additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting. Automotive Financing Options We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Currently, both programs are available only in certain international markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31, 2018 totaled $149.7 million in value. We have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. To date, we have only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us. Based on current market demand for our vehicles, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts, but resale prices may inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. We currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada. We also offer leasing through leasing partners in certain jurisdictions. Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities, we assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings, including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Energy Generation and Storage Financing Options We offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and PPAs. In both structures, we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee. In the lease structure, this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee. In the PPA structure, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces. The leases and PPAs are typically for 20 years with a renewal option, and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations. For customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems, we also offer solar loans, whereby a third-party lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed, installed and serviced by us. We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer. Separately, the customer enters into a loan agreement with a third-party lender, who finances the full purchase price. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. 45 Gigafactory 1 We continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules, battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products. We also continue to invest in the future expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there. For example, we have announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1. Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As these terms convey to us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, Leases, their production equipment, we consider them to be leased assets when production commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply similar accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $766.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. While we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp. For example, we have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory 1, which negatively affected our production of Model 3. While we continue to resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1 as they arise, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate. Gigafactory 2 We have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 1.0 GW of solar products annually in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into an agreement with Panasonic under which it manufactures custom PV cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and we purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10-year term. The terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants, and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the agreement. Although we remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility, acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits. Gigafactory Shanghai We are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S. We broke ground in January 2019, and subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online, we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019. We expect much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing, supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us. Moreover, we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory, from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai. Other Manufacturing We continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities, and continually explore additional production capacity internationally. 46 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition Adoption of new revenue standard On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method. The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. 47 Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. The two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. Automotive Regulatory Credits California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits (“ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits, on our vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third-parties to purchase our regulatory credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. 48 Automotive Leasing Revenue Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases. Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Currently, the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U.S. and Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the United States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date. 49 Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. There were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard. Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. 50 For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance. In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. 51 We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs, which include the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures). 52 For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets. 53 In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. As such, in accordance with SAB 118, we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. 54 Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. When determining such fair values, we make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates. Our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Furthermore, our estimates might change as additional information becomes available, as more fully discussed in Note 3, Business Combinations, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our revenue from non-ZEV regulatory credits generally follows our production and delivery trends as we have long-term contracts with existing customers for the sale of these credits. However, as we do not have long-term contracts for ZEV credit sales, revenue from sale of ZEV credits fluctuate by quarter depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer. For example, our revenue from ZEV credit sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $179.1 million while it was $0 in the three months ended June 30, 2018. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We do not yet offer leasing for Model 3 vehicles. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 55 2018 Compared to 2017 Automotive sales revenue increased $9.10 billion, or 107%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of approximately 144,330 Model 3 deliveries from our significant production ramp in the year ended December 31, 2018, delivered at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Additionally, we recognized $1.40 billion of additional automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of $58.3 million in sales of regulatory credits to $418.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. ZEV credits sales were $103.4 million and non-ZEV regulatory credits sales were $315.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $279.7 million ZEV credit sales and $80.6 million in non-ZEV regulatory credit sales in the year ended December 31, 2017. The growth in non-ZEV regulatory credits year-over-year was generally consistent with the delivery volume growth. The above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 3,240 Model S and Model X deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding the impact of adoption of the new revenue standard, at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $223.1 million, or 20%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of $832.7 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard, partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. When our counterparty retains ownership, any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue. Services and other revenue increased $389.9 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-in vehicles, partially offset by lower average selling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in trade-ins of relatively lower priced non-Tesla vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, there was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017. 2017 Compared to 2016 Automotive sales revenue increased $2.95 billion, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily related to a 58% increase in deliveries to 80,060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X, at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period, as well as sales of 1,764 Model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, sales of regulatory credits increased by $58.0 million to $360.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. ZEV credits sales were $279.7 million and non-ZEV regulatory credits sales were $80.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $215.4 million ZEV credit sales and $86.9 million in non-ZEV regulatory credit sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increases were partially offset by additional deferrals of Autopilot 2.0 revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. Automotive leasing revenue increased $344.8 million, or 45%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an approximately 30% increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an increase of $23.4 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Service and other revenue increased $533.2 million, or 114%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our trade-in program. Additionally, there was a $41.1 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from Grohmann Engineering GmbH (now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH, which we acquired on January 3, 2017, and a $68.4 million increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended December 31, 2017. 56 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products, leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of solar energy systems incentives. 2018 Compared to 2017 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $439.0 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in deployments of Powerpack, Powerwall, and cash and loan solar energy systems projects. The increase in Powerpack revenue was significant year-over-year due to increases in revenue recognized for commercial projects, most predominantly $81.2 million for the South Australia battery project. Additionally, we increased Powerwall production in the year ended December 31, 2018, which helped us to continue to work through our energy storage order backlog. 2017 Compared to 2016 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $934.9 million, or 515%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, predominantly due to the inclusion of the full-year of revenue from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21, 2016. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 13,685,572 $ 6,724,480 $ 4,268,087 $ 6,961,092 104 % $ 2,456,393 58 % Automotive leasing 488,425 708,224 481,994 (219,799 ) -31 % 226,230 47 % Total automotive cost of revenues 14,173,997 7,432,704 4,750,081 6,741,293 91 % 2,682,623 56 % Services and other 1,880,354 1,229,022 472,462 651,332 53 % 756,560 160 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 16,054,351 8,661,726 5,222,543 7,392,625 85 % 3,439,183 66 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,364,896 874,538 178,332 490,358 56 % 696,206 390 % Total cost of revenues $ 17,419,247 $ 9,536,264 $ 5,400,875 $ 7,882,983 83 % $ 4,135,389 77 % Gross profit total automotive $ 4,340,986 $ 2,208,596 $ 1,600,685 Gross margin total automotive 23 % 23 % 25 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 3,851,673 $ 1,980,759 $ 1,596,195 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 19 % 19 % 23 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 190,348 $ 241,728 $ 3,062 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 12 % 22 % 2 % Total gross profit $ 4,042,021 $ 2,222,487 $ 1,599,257 Total gross margin 19 % 19 % 23 % 57 Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, and costs for retail merchandise. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 2018 Compared to 2017 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $6.96 billion, or 104%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of Model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the recognition of $969.8 million of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard. These increases were partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost efficiencies. Additionally, there were lower overall costs for Model S and Model X cash deliveries from approximately 3,240 fewer units delivered year-over-year and reductions in combined Model S and Model X average costs per unit as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $219.8 million, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of $624.4 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard, partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. When our counterparty retains ownership, the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. Cost of services and other revenue increased $651.3 million, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers, additional service personnel in existing and new service centers, Mobile Service capabilities, parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles. Additionally, there was an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced non-Tesla trade-in vehicles. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017. 58 Gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at 23% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. There were increases from improved Model S and Model X combined margins as costs per unit decreased year-over-year from continuing manufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales, which have no associated costs. The increases were partially offset by margin dilution from Model 3 despite Model 3 margins improving year-over-year. The higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as Model 3 had a lower annualized margin than Model S and Model X due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above. Services and other has historically operated at lower margins than our automotive sales and leasing business but has a small impact on the overall segment margin because of its relatively small revenue base. 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of automotive sales revenues increased $2.46 billion, or 58%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to a 58% increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X, as well as the commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $226.2 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an approximately 30% increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an increase of $23.4 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees. Cost of services and other revenue increased $756.6 million, or 160%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25% to 23% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps and increases in early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees year-over-year contributed to the lower gross margin. Lower material and manufacturing costs for Model S and Model X, as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 2.0 revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017 partially offset the overall decrease. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 23% to 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive, as explained above, as well as higher costs of maintenance service. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In addition, where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 59 2018 Compared to 2017 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $490.4 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in deployments of Powerpack, Powerwall, and cash and loan solar energy system projects. The increase in Powerpack cost of revenue was significant year-over-year due to increases in cost of revenue recognized for commercial projects, most predominantly $72.5 million for the South Australia battery project. Additionally, costs for cash and loan solar energy system projects have increased from higher installation costs, higher allocation of overhead costs from lower deployment of solar projects overall, and certain warranty related one-time charges. There were also higher costs for our solar energy system leasing arrangements due to impairment charges and higher costs from temporary manufacturing under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp. Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 22% to 12% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the higher proportion of energy storage of our overall energy generation and storage portfolio, due to a three-fold growth of MWh of energy storage deployments in the year ended December 31, 2018. Although energy storage margins have improved significantly as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, it continues to operate at a lower margin than our solar business, thereby having a greater dilutive impact on our gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, increases in costs for our cash and loan solar energy system projects, impairment charges on solar energy system leasing arrangements, and temporary manufacturing under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp have further contributed to the decrease in gross margin. 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $696.2 million, or 390%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to the inclusion of the full-year of costs from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21, 2016. Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2% to 22% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was predominantly due to the inclusion of the full-year of revenue and costs from our solar business, which we gained by acquiring SolarCity. Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Research and development $ 1,460,370 $ 1,378,073 $ 834,408 $ 82,297 6 % $ 543,665 65 % As a percentage of revenues 7 % 12 % 12 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses increased $82.3 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an $84.2 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from headcount growth to support our business expansion and $45.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, there was an increase of $16.0 million in facilities, freight, and depreciation expenses due to business expansion, offset by a $69.7 million decrease in expensed materials as there were higher costs in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to Model 3 development. 60 R&D expenses increased $543.7 million, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $274.9 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses, and a $44.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, there were increases in facilities expenses, depreciation expenses, professional and outside service expenses and expensed materials to support the development of future products.

SG&A expenses increased $358.0 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $193.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award and stock awards granted for new hires and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, there was a $153.9 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related expenses and sales and marketing activities to support our business expansion. SG&A expenses increased $1.04 billion, or 73%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $524.0 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses, and a $64.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. Additionally, the increase was due to a $310.6 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a $140.6 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business. Restructuring and other Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ 135,233 $ — $ — $ 135,233 N/A $ — N/A As a percentage of revenues 1 % 0 % 0 % During 2018, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized $36.6 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The employee termination cash expenses of $27.3 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55.2 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of the in-process research and development asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13.3 million. 61 In October 2018, a final court order was entered approving the terms of a settlement in connection with the SEC’s legal actions relating to Elon Musk’s prior consideration during the third quarter of 2018 of a take-private proposal for Tesla. Consequently, we recognized settlement and legal expenses of $30.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018. There were no restructuring actions in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (663,071 ) $ (471,259 ) $ (198,810 ) $ (191,812 ) 41 % $ (272,449 ) 137 % As a percentage of revenues 3 % 4 % 3 % Interest expense increased by $191.8 million, or 41%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, there was a decrease of $70.0 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statement of operations to property, plant, and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Lower capitalization results in higher interest expense. The amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance, which decreased year-over-year due to significant Model 3 capital expenditure ramp in the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense increased by $272.4 million, or 137%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the full-year of interest expense from SolarCity of $185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the Senior Notes due in 2025, both of which we issued during 2017.

We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Other income (expense), net, changed favorably by $147.2 million to a gain of $21.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from a loss of $125.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gains from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities year-over-year. Additionally, we had $57.7 million of losses in the year ended December 31, 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair values of certain SolarCity liabilities as previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, with no corresponding expense in the year ended December 31, 2018. Other income (expense), net, changed unfavorably by $236.7 million to a loss of $125.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from a gain of $111.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $57.7 million of losses in the year ended December 31, 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of SolarCity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 62 Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 57,837 $ 31,546 $ 26,698 $ 26,291 83 % $ 4,848 18 % Effective tax rate -6 % -1 % -4 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $26.3 million, or 83%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions year-over-year. Our provision for income taxes increased by $4.9 million, or 18%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions, partially offset by $10.5 million of future U.S. alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which previously had an associated valuation allowance. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ (86,491 ) $ (279,178 ) $ (98,132 ) $ 192,687 -69 % $ (181,046 ) 184 % Our net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2018, we had $3.69 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $749.0 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Japanese yen. Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, increases in Model 3 production capacity at the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory 1, the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network. We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion. 63 In 2019, we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels. For example, based on our experience with ramping Model 3 at the Tesla Factory, we expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3 manufacturing capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont. Likewise, based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between Model Y and Model 3, we believe that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at Fremont. Considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between $2.5 to $3.0 billion annually for the next two fiscal years. Moreover, we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations (including the repayment of $920.0 million for our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1, 2019), although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. In addition, we had $1.50 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2018, some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets; and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds). Upon the draw-down of any unused committed amounts, there are no restrictions on the use of such funds for general corporate purposes. For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 13, Long-Term Debt Obligations, and Note 18, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 64 Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,097,802 $ (60,654 ) $ (123,829 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,337,428 ) $ (4,195,877 ) $ (1,081,085 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 573,755 $ 4,414,864 $ 3,743,976 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital, especially inventory, which includes vehicles in transit. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, lease payments directly from customers, customer deposits, sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash from operating activities changed favorably by $2.16 billion to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.10 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018 from net cash used in operating activities of $60.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $1.60 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $554.6 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, wherein certain vehicle sales to customer or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee were previously accounted for as an in-substance operating leases are now accounted for as sales with a right of return upon control transfer. The increase in cash from certain operating activities was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory, as a result of increased Model 3 and energy products deliveries and production. Additionally, there was a decrease in customer deposits primarily due to Model 3 fulfillments and an increase in other assets as we paid $141.3 million for the land use rights for Gigafactory Shanghai. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $63.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $197.3 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $134.1 million. The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of $773.0 million, the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expanded, the increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9 million and deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of $388.4 million primarily due to Model 3 reservations. These increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $2.32 billion during 2018, $4.08 billion during 2017 and $1.44 billion during 2016. Capital expenditures during 2018 were $2.10 billion from purchases of property and equipment, mainly for Model 3 production and the expansion of our customer support infrastructure, and $218.8 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers. 65 Capital expenditures during 2017 were $3.41 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3 production and $666.5 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers. We also paid $114.5 million, net of the cash acquired, for acquisitions in 2017. Capital expenditures during 2016 were $1.28 billion from purchases of property and equipment and $159.7 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers. These expenditures were partially offset by the assumed cash of $342.7 million as a result of the SolarCity acquisition in 2016. In 2014, we began construction of Gigafactory 1. We used $687.0 million, $1.45 billion, and $455.3 million of cash towards Gigafactory 1 construction during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $1.18 billion of net borrowings under automobile asset-backed notes, $431.0 million of net borrowings under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), $334.1 million from the issuance of solar asset-backed notes and $295.7 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of $581.9 million under our vehicle lease-backed loan and security agreements (the “Warehouse Agreements”), collateralized lease repayments of $559.2 million, repayments of $230.0 million of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018, and repayments of $210.2 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt Obligations, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of $966.4 million from the issuance of the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, $1.77 billion from the issuance of the 5.3% Senior Notes due in 2025 and $400.2 million from our March 2017 public offering of common stock, net of underwriter fees. However, we paid $151.2 million for the purchase of bond hedges net of the amount we received from the sale of warrants. Furthermore, we received $511.3 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings and $527.5 million of net proceeds from fund investors. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of $1.70 billion from our May 2016 public offering of common stock, net of underwriter fees, $995.4 million of proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments and $769.7 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings. The net proceeds from issuances of debt consisted primarily of $834.0 million of net borrowings under the Credit Agreement and $390.0 million of borrowings under the Warehouse Agreements, partially offset by settlements of $454.7 million for certain conversions of the 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in June 2018. Furthermore, we received $180.3 million of net proceeds from fund investors. 66 Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2018, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Operating lease obligations $ 1,628,154 $ 275,654 $ 256,931 $ 230,406 $ 182,911 $ 157,662 $ 524,590 Capital lease obligations, including interest 1,461,236 416,952 503,545 506,197 23,828 4,776 5,938 Purchase obligations (1) 18,088,100 4,860,431 3,255,968 3,391,637 3,985,336 2,570,730 23,998 Long-term debt, including scheduled interest (2) 12,570,082 2,583,160 2,485,372 2,260,528 1,629,556 302,345 3,309,121 Total $ 33,747,572 $ 8,136,197 $ 6,501,816 $ 6,388,768 $ 5,821,631 $ 3,035,513 $ 3,863,647 (1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $2.40 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2018 and (ii) $15.69 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory 1, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2018, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date or, where applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2018. (2) Long-term debt, including scheduled interest, includes our non-recourse indebtedness of $3.61 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets of our subsidiaries. Short-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 is $361.2 million. Long-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the years thereafter is $1.58 billion. The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $243.8 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 67 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and, in particular, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $1.5 million in other income (expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, New Taiwan dollar and Canadian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a net foreign currency loss of $52.3 million in other income (expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of $175.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $116.0 million at December 31, 2017. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by $8.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. 68",2023-12-31 03:12:56.522242

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2017-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2019. Overview and 2019 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to our products. Automotive During 2019, we achieved annual vehicle delivery and production records of 367,656 and 365,232 total vehicles, respectively. We also laid the groundwork for our next phase of growth with the commencement of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai; preparations at the Fremont Factory for Model Y production, which commenced in the first quarter of 2020; the selection of Berlin, Germany as the site for our next factory for the European market; and the unveiling of Cybertruck. We also continued to enhance our user experience through improved Autopilot and FSD features, including the introduction of a new powerful on-board FSD computer and a new Smart Summon feature, and the expansion of a unique set of in-car entertainment options. Energy Generation and Storage We revamped key aspects of our solar operations in 2019 by streamlining traditionally complex ordering, permitting, installation and back-end service processes to enhance the customer experience, especially for retrofit solar installations. Our solar deployments grew approximately 48% and 26%, quarter-over-quarter, in the second half of the year. We also deployed 1.65 GWh of energy storage in 2019, more than the aggregate of all prior years. Finally, we further evolved our product offerings by launching the third generation of the Solar Roof, for which we are expanding both our manufacturing and installation capabilities, and Megapack, our largest utility-scale energy storage product to date. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2020 Outlook Automotive—Production A key focus in 2020 will be our efforts towards establishing and expanding capacity for vehicle production at volume across three continents. At the Fremont Factory, we commenced Model Y production earlier than anticipated, and combined with Model 3, we have installed annual production capacity for 400,000 vehicles. We expect to further increase this capacity to 500,000 vehicles through the installation of additional equipment. At Gigafactory Shanghai, we have installed annual production capacity for 150,000 Model 3 vehicles that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number, subject to local production of battery packs, which we began ramping there later than other processes. We have commenced construction of the next phase of Gigafactory Shanghai to add Model Y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for Model 3. To finance our construction and expansion, in December 2019 our local subsidiary entered into a RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) fixed asset term facility and a RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) working capital revolving facility, part of which was used to repay a RMB 3.5 billion bridge loan entered into in March 2019. We are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures. 39 Finally, we have selected Germany as the site of our next factory for manufacturing vehicles for the European market, due to its strong manufacturing and engineering presence. However, the construction of and ramp at Gigafactory Berlin, as well as at Gigafactory Shanghai, are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, potential supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Ultimately, achieving increased total vehicle production cost-effectively across all of our manufacturing operations will require that we timely address any bottlenecks that may arise as we ramp, establish and maintain sustained supplier capacity, and successfully utilize manufacturing processes at the maximum output rates that we have planned for them. Automotive—Demand and Sales As the automotive industry continues to validate and grow the market for electric vehicles, we are generating demand and new customers even without traditional marketing and with relatively low marketing costs, and in 2019 our orders shifted to originating mostly from new customers without prior reservations. Production at Gigafactory Shanghai allows us to offer Model 3 in China at competitive local pricing and more quickly, which should drive further demand and opportunity in the world’s largest market for mid-sized premium sedans, and we expect a similar impact in China for Model Y when we commence production there of this offering in the popular compact SUV segment. Moreover, the significant interest generated by our unveiling of Cybertruck demonstrated our brand visibility, innovation and viability across an increasing range of vehicle segments. Meanwhile, we are making our existing vehicles incrementally more compelling, including through a planned software update for FSD-enabled vehicles to react to traffic lights and stop signs and navigate city intersections, and additional functionality of both in-vehicle software and the Tesla mobile app. On the other hand, we may be impacted by trade and environmental policies, political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations, which are inherently unpredictable. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility. Specifically, it is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales. Finally, we make certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including as we introduce new vehicles and variants and optimize the pricing among them. Such pricing changes may impact our vehicles’ resale values, and in turn our operating results. For example, if price reductions result in an increase to our estimates of the volume of vehicles that may potentially be returned to us under pre-existing resale value guarantees provided to customers and partners for certain financing programs, our gross profits may be reduced. Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure We continue to optimize our manufacturing and global delivery patterns to address higher volumes of our predominantly single-factory production at the Fremont Factory. We expect to alleviate any related issues through local production at Gigafactory Shanghai and eventually at Gigafactory Berlin. We also continue to expand and invest in our servicing and charging locations and capabilities to keep pace with our customer vehicle fleet and ensure a convenient and efficient customer experience. However, if our customer vehicles, particularly in the rapidly growing Model 3 fleet, experience unexpected reliability issues, it could outpace and overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment We expect to continue to grow our retrofit solar system deployments as we execute our new strategy, including through compelling financing options such as a subscription-based offering, which is currently available in California. 40 We are focused on training our personnel and third party partners to ramp installations of our Solar Roof, and are also hiring rapidly for its ongoing manufacturing ramp at Gigafactory New York. We expect such ramp will support our significant operations and our compliance with minimum hiring and cumulative investment targets under our agreement with the SUNY Foundation related to the construction and use of Gigafactory New York. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation. Finally, with the introduction of our 3 MWh Megapack, we now offer an even greater variety of scalable energy storage products with a wide range of markets and applications, and expect this product to drive additional interest from global project developers and utilities. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Our capital expenditures are difficult to project beyond the short term, given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time. For example, the curve of any new product ramp, such as for Model Y and the Solar Roof, is inherently subject to uncertainty of timing, and if we are able to meet various milestones along such ramp more quickly than expected, our capital expenditures may be accelerated. We also continuously evaluate, and as appropriate adjust, our capital expenditures based on, among other things: our manufacturing plans for our various products, which we may rebalance from time to time based on the mix of demand among them and other contingent factors; the pace and prioritization of current projects under development; and the addition of any new projects. Moreover, we are generally increasing the capital efficiency of our projects with experience, and we may find that our actual capital expenditures on new projects are different than previously expected. Subject to the above, considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products, construction and expansion of our factories, and pipeline of announced projects under development, and consistent with our current strategy of using partners to manufacture battery cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth, we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. We expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future as we focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation, as well as from increases in expected overall revenues from our expanding sales. In particular, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business have already manifested in total operating expenses decreasing from $4.4 billion to $4.1 billion from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019, including restructuring and other charges. Meanwhile, our total revenues increased from $21.5 billion to $24.6 billion in the same period. In March 2018, our stockholders approved the 2018 CEO Performance Award, with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones. We will incur significant non-cash stock-based compensation expense for each tranche under this award after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met, and if later than the grant date, we will also have to record a cumulative catch-up expense at such time. Such catch-up expense may be material depending on the length of time elapsed from the grant date. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, as the result of an additional operational milestone becoming probable of achievement, we recorded a cumulative catch-up expense of $72 million for service provided from the grant date. Moreover, as the expense for a tranche is recorded over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period of the relevant operational milestone and (ii) only if the related market capitalization milestone has not been achieved, its expected achievement period, the achievement of a market capitalization milestone earlier than expected may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. Upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining associated expense will be recognized immediately. See Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans—2018 CEO Performance Award, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the stock-based compensation relating to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. 41 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition Adoption of new revenue standard On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method. The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. 42 Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases prior to January 1, 2019, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. Automotive Regulatory Credits In connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. We also earn other types of saleable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. 43 Automotive Leasing Revenue Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases. Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. As of December 31, 2019, the direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the U.S. and new Model S and Model X vehicles in Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions were accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customers can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. 44 Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period. In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheets to used vehicle inventory. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers, including solar subscription-based arrangements. Upon adoption of ASC 842, energy generation and storage sales revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now accounted for under the new revenue standard. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance. 45 In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. 46 We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided since the grant date. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. 47 As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 48 Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue. 49 2019 Compared to 2018 Automotive sales revenue increased $2.32 billion, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase of 137,969 Model 3 cash deliveries from production scaling and an increase of $175 million in sales of regulatory credits to $594 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 30,487 Model S and Model X cash deliveries. The deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2019 were at lower average selling prices than the prior year due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings and the introduction of lower end Model 3 trims in 2019. Due to the price adjustments, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $555 million. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $14 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 direct leasing in the second quarter of 2019. Services and other revenue increased $835 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-in vehicles, partially offset by lower average selling prices for traded-in Tesla vehicles due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019. Additionally, there was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products, and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 2019 Compared to 2018 Energy generation and storage revenue decreased by $24 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset increases in deployments of Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack. 50 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 15,939 $ 13,686 $ 6,725 $ 2,253 16 % $ 6,961 104 % Automotive leasing 459 488 708 (29 ) -6 % (220 ) -31 % Total automotive cost of revenues 16,398 14,174 7,433 2,224 16 % 6,741 91 % Services and other 2,770 1,880 1,229 890 47 % 651 53 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 19,168 16,054 8,662 3,114 19 % 7,392 85 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,341 1,365 874 (24 ) -2 % 491 56 % Total cost of revenues $ 20,509 $ 17,419 $ 9,536 $ 3,090 18 % $ 7,883 83 % Gross profit total automotive $ 4,423 $ 4,341 $ 2,209 Gross margin total automotive 21 % 23 % 23 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 3,879 $ 3,852 $ 1,981 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 17 % 19 % 19 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 190 $ 190 $ 242 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 12 % 12 % 22 % Total gross profit $ 4,069 $ 4,042 $ 2,223 Total gross margin 17 % 19 % 19 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 51 2019 Compared to 2018 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $2.25 billion, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase of 137,969 Model 3 cash deliveries and higher average Model S and Model X costs per unit compared to the prior year due to the discontinuation of lower end trims in 2019. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30,487 Model S and Model X cash deliveries and a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trims introduced in 2019 and temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018. Additionally, due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. If customers elect to exercise the buyback options, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $29 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 leasing in the second quarter of 2019. Cost of services and other revenue increased $890 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the costs of used vehicle sales from the increased volumes of trade-in vehicles. Additionally, there were increases in the costs of our new service centers, additional service personnel in existing and new service centers, Mobile Service capabilities, parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 23% to 21% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower Model S and Model X margins from lower selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019, a higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales compared to the prior period. Additionally, the price adjustments also resulted in a reduction in gross automotive sales profit of $104 million from the adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program. The decrease was partially offset by improvement of Model 3 margins compared to the prior year as we achieved additional manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3 and an increase of $175 million in sales of regulatory credits. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 19% to 17% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a higher proportion of services and other within the segment, which operates at lower gross margins than our automotive business. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In addition, where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2019 Compared to 2018 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased by $24 million , or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs, partially offset by increases in deployments of Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack. 52 Gross margin for energy generation and storage remained relatively consistent at 12% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Energy storage gross margins improved in the current year as a result of lower materials costs, partially offset by lower gross margins in our cash and loan solar business driven by higher costs from temporary manufacturing under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp. Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Research and development $ 1,343 $ 1,460 $ 1,378 $ (117 ) -8 % $ 82 6 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 7 % 12 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 7% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales, as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business. R&D expenses decreased $117 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $95 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from cost efficiency initiatives and a $26 million decrease in professional and outside service expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 2,646 $ 2,835 $ 2,477 $ (189 ) -7 % $ 358 14 % As a percentage of revenues 11 % 13 % 21 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13% to 11% in year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales, as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business. SG&A expenses decreased $189 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $302 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from decreased headcount and cost efficiency initiatives, partially offset by a $112 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award as we recorded a $72 million cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided from the grant date when an additional operational milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, the expense period was shorter in the prior year as it commenced upon the grant approval date of March 21, 2018. 53 Restructuring and other Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ 149 $ 135 $ — $ 14 10% $ 135 N/A As a percentage of revenues 1 % 1 % 0 % During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a result, we recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments. We recognized $47 million in impairment related to the IPR&D intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts (refer to Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for details) and $15 million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a loss of $37 million for closing operations in certain facilities. On the statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges. The employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized $37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The employee termination cash expenses of $27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Interest expense $ 685 $ 663 $ 471 $ 22 3 % $ 192 41 % As a percentage of revenues 3 % 3 % 4 % Interest expense increased by $22 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Other income (expense), net $ 45 $ 22 $ (125 ) $ 23 105% $ 147 Not meaningful As a percentage of revenues 0 % 0 % -1 % Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. 54 Other income (expense), net, increased by $23 million, or 105%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by losses from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities year-over-year. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 110 $ 58 $ 32 $ 52 90 % $ 26 81 % Effective tax rate -17 % -6 % -1 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $52 million, or 90%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions year-over-year. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 $ % $ % Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ 87 $ (87 ) $ (279 ) $ 174 Not meaningful $ 192 -69 % Our net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests changed unfavorably by $174 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily due to lower activities in our financing fund arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2019, we had $6.27 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.26 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollars. Our sources of cash are predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, establishment and/or increases of Model 3 and Model Y production capacity at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory Nevada, the construction of Gigafactory Berlin, the manufacturing ramp of the Solar Roof at Gigafactory New York, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2020 Outlook—Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products, construction and expansion of our factories, and pipeline of projects under development, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture battery cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth, we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. 55 We expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations, although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will continue to be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China, such as the RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) fixed asset term facility and RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) working capital revolving facility that our local subsidiary entered into in December 2019, and we expect the same with respect to Gigafactory Berlin. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business, to further strengthen our balance sheet, or for general corporate purposes. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory New York. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. In addition, we had $3.03 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2019, some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets; and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds). Upon the draw-down of any unused committed amounts, there are no restrictions on use of available funds for general corporate purposes. For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 12, Debt, and Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,405 $ 2,098 $ (61 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,436 ) $ (2,337 ) $ (4,196 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,529 $ 574 $ 4,415 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital, especially inventory, which includes vehicles in transit. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, customer lease payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. 56 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $307 million to $2.41 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.10 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $902 million, partially offset by the increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $407 million and $188 million of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 which was classified as an operating activity, as this represented an interest payment on the discounted convertible notes. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2019 as compared to 2018, as we were ramping for Model 3 production in 2018 and a larger increase in operating lease vehicles in 2019 as compared to 2018 as we began offering Model 3 leasing in 2019. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in inventory and a larger increase in deferred revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.33 billion during 2019, mainly for Gigafactory Shanghai construction, Model 3 production, and Model Y preparations, and $2.10 billion during 2018, mainly for Model 3 production. Design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems amounted to $105 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $1.82 billion from the issuance of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”), net of transaction costs, and $848 million from the issuance of common stock, net of underwriting discounts, in registered public offerings, $736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain Chinese subsidiaries, $394 million of net borrowings for automotive asset-backed notes, and $174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes. These cash inflows were partially offset by a $732 million portion of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing activity, a $566 million repayment of our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, a purchase of convertible note hedges of $476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, and collateralized lease repayments of $389 million. See Note 12, Debt, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $1.18 billion of net borrowings under automobile asset-backed notes, $431 million of net borrowings under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), $334 million from the issuance of solar asset-backed notes and $296 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of $582 million under our vehicle lease-backed loan and security agreements (the “Warehouse Agreements”), collateralized lease repayments of $559 million, repayments of $230 million of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018, and repayments of $210 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility. 57 Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2019, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in millions): Year Ended December 31, Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest $ 1,459 $ 296 $ 262 $ 210 $ 173 $ 146 $ 372 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest 1,795 474 478 600 225 5 13 Purchase obligations (1) 16,292 5,729 2,946 3,645 3,948 24 — Debt, including scheduled interest (2) 14,031 1,774 2,594 2,287 1,993 2,575 2,808 Total $ 33,577 $ 8,273 $ 6,280 $ 6,742 $ 6,339 $ 2,750 $ 3,193 (1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $2.50 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2019 and (ii) $13.79 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2019, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date or, where applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2019. (2) Debt, including scheduled interest, includes our non-recourse indebtedness of $5.29 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. Short-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $375 million. Long-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the years thereafter is $1.86 billion. The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $247 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners (refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs, should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options, would be $1.70 billion over the next five years, of which $226 million is within a 12-month period from December 31, 2019. We have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options. Additionally, we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore, the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited. 58 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 59 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and, in particular, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $48 million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the U.S. dollar, British pound and Canadian dollar as our subsidiaries are denominated in various local currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $2 million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, New Taiwan dollar and Canadian dollar. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of $362 million at December 31, 2019 and $176 million at December 31, 2018 assuming no foreign currency hedging. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in our interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 by $8 million and $9 million, respectively. 60",2023-12-31 03:12:56.921892

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2018-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2020. Overview and 2020 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. In 2020, we produced 509,737 vehicles and delivered 499,647 vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity, developing and ramping our battery cell technology, increasing the affordability of our vehicles, expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next vehicles. In 2020, we deployed 3.02 GWh of energy storage products and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems. In 2020, we recognized total revenues of $31.54 billion, representing an increase of $6.96 billion compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. In 2020, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $721 million, representing a favorable change of $1.58 billion compared to the prior year. In 2020, our operating margin was 6.3%, representing a favorable change of 6.6% compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on operational efficiencies, while we have seen an acceleration of non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to a rapid increase in our market capitalization and updates to our business outlook. We ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents, representing an increase of $13.12 billion from the end of 2019. Our cash flows from operating activities during 2020 was $5.94 billion, compared to $2.41 billion during 2019, and capital expenditures amounted to $3.16 billion during 2020, compared to $1.33 billion during 2019. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, but we will continue a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2021 Outlook Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic There continues to be worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date, we have previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments, and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. There are also ongoing related risks to our business depending on the progression of the pandemic, and recent trends in certain regions have indicated potential returns to limited or closed government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply, and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted. Please see the “Results of Operations” section of this Item below and certain risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly the first risk factor included there, for more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our business. We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends from this pandemic, the sustained impact of which is largely unknown, is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. 31 Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S and Model X Active Model 3 and Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 and Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin Model Y Constructing manufacturing facilities Gigafactory Texas Model Y Constructing manufacturing facilities Cybertruck In development TBD Tesla Semi In development Tesla Roadster In development We recently announced updated versions of Model S and Model X featuring a redesigned powertrain and other improvements. In 2021, we are focused on ramping these models on new manufacturing equipment, as well as production rates of Model 3 and Model Y, to at least the capacity that we have installed. The next phase of production growth will depend on the construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, each of which is progressing as planned for deliveries beginning in 2021. Our goal is to continuously decrease production costs and increase the affordability of our vehicles. We are continuing to develop and manufacture our own battery cells, with which we are targeting high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. As cell supply is critical to our business, coupling this strategy with cells from our suppliers will help us stay ahead of any potential constraints. However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic and any industry-wide component constraints. Moreover, we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. In addition to opening new factories in 2021, we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ functionality, including Autopilot, FSD and software features, and introducing anticipated future vehicles. Moreover, we expect to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade, environmental and political uncertainty, all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, there have been recent signs of recovery from competitors that experienced downturns in 2020, meaning that we will have to continue to execute well to maintain the momentum that we have gained relative to an ever-growing competitive landscape. Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our deliveries increase, we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Situating our factories closer to local markets should mitigate the strain on our deliveries. In any case, as we expand, we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher interest, and cross-selling with our residential solar energy products will continue to benefit both product lines. We remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we are working to improve our installation capabilities for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training a large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 32 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and uncertainties in future global market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic currently makes projections more challenging. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Model Y and Solar Roof, constructing or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be $4.50 to $6.00 billion in 2021 and each of the next two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased recently, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “in-the-money” convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. We also opportunistically strengthened our liquidity further through an at-the-market offering of common stock in December 2020, with net proceeds to us of approximately $4.99 billion. Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of non-cash stock compensation expense attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we additionally increase operational efficiency and process automation. In March 2018, our stockholders approved a performance-based stock option award to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”), consisting of 12 vesting tranches contingent on the achievement of specified market capitalization and operational milestones. We incur non-cash stock-based compensation expense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance, and if this happens following the grant date, we record at such time a cumulative catch-up expense that may be significant based on the length of time elapsed from the grant date. Moreover, the remaining expense for that tranche is ratably recorded over the period remaining until the later of (i) the expected achievement of the relevant operational milestone (if it has not yet been achieved) and (ii) the expected achievement of the related market capitalization milestone (if it has not yet been achieved). Upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately. Because the expected market capitalization achievements are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievements, the achievement of the former earlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catch-up expense and/or accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized. During 2020, several operational milestones became probable and several tranches vested, including as a result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly, resulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within a relatively short period of time. See Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans—2018 CEO Performance Award, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the stock-based compensation relating to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. As our market capitalization is unpredictable and our financial performance improves, it is possible that the earlier-than-planned recognition of such expenses will continue in the near term. In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. As we currently intend to hold these assets long-term, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. 33 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. 34 With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the Automotive Leasing section below, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. 35 Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months. Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers, including solar subscription-based arrangements. Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019, which is recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance. In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. 36 As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. 37 Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided since the grant date. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. 38 Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is likely that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached. 39 Results of Operations Effects of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020. The temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that, together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operations in the year, negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020. While we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide, our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation, certain payroll related expenses and property taxes. As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020. This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions. Additionally, we suspended non-critical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements. As part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses. The impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits. Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Automotive sales $ 26,184 $ 19,952 $ 17,632 $ 6,232 31 % $ 2,320 13 % Automotive leasing 1,052 869 883 183 21 % (14 ) -2 % Total automotive revenues 27,236 20,821 18,515 6,415 31 % 2,306 12 % Services and other 2,306 2,226 1,391 80 4 % 835 60 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 29,542 23,047 19,906 6,495 28 % 3,141 16 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 1,994 1,531 1,555 463 30 % (24 ) -2 % Total revenues $ 31,536 $ 24,578 $ 21,461 $ 6,958 28 % $ 3,117 15 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019 and we began offering direct leasing for Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer, which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. 40 2020 compared to 2019 Automotive sales revenue increased $6.23 billion, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of 129,268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. We were able to increase deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. There was also an increase of $986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to $1.58 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales revenue of $555 million. We made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of automotive sales revenue of $72 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The smaller reduction in revenue from pricing adjustments resulted in a positive impact to automotive sales revenue of $483 million year over year. These factors increasing automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y. Despite the inclusion of higher priced Model Y deliveries in 2020, the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y decreased due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was a decrease in automotive sales revenue from 8,669 fewer Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Automotive leasing revenue increased $183 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct sales-type leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. These increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined. Services and other revenue increased $80 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, an increase in retail merchandise revenue and an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our mid-year 2019 acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in non-Tesla trade-ins. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 2020 compared to 2019 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $463 million, or 30%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack, solar cash and loan jobs and Powerwall, partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy. Powerpack deployments have decreased following the introduction of our Megapack product, which we began deploying in late 2019. 41 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 19,696 $ 15,939 $ 13,686 $ 3,757 24 % $ 2,253 16 % Automotive leasing 563 459 488 104 23 % (29 ) -6 % Total automotive cost of revenues 20,259 16,398 14,174 3,861 24 % 2,224 16 % Services and other 2,671 2,770 1,880 (99 ) -4 % 890 47 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 22,930 19,168 16,054 3,762 20 % 3,114 19 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,976 1,341 1,365 635 47 % (24 ) -2 % Total cost of revenues $ 24,906 $ 20,509 $ 17,419 $ 4,397 21 % $ 3,090 18 % Gross profit total automotive $ 6,977 $ 4,423 $ 4,341 Gross margin total automotive 26 % 21 % 23 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 6,612 $ 3,879 $ 3,852 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 22 % 17 % 19 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 18 $ 190 $ 190 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 1 % 12 % 12 % Total gross profit $ 6,630 $ 4,069 $ 4,042 Total gross margin 21 % 17 % 19 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases which were introduced in volume in the third quarter of 2020, as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 2020 compared to 2019 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $3.76 billion, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of 129,268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. Due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and if customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of $451 million. We made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of $42 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, there was an increase to cost of automotive sales revenue from idle capacity charges of $213 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. These factors increasing cost of automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit due to lower material, manufacturing, freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in China and a higher sales mix of lower end trims, as well as a decrease of 8,669 Model S and Model X cash deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. 42 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $104 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct sales-type leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all cost of revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. These increases were partially offset by the decreases in cost of automotive lease revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined. Cost of services and other revenue decreased $99 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by a reduction in non-Tesla trade-ins, partially offset by increases in non-warranty maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow and an increase in costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased. Gross margin for total automotive increased from 21% to 26% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an improvement of Model 3 gross margin primarily from lower material, manufacturing, freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in China, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of Model 3 due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase of $986 million in sales of regulatory credits and a positive impact from Model Y deliveries in 2020 as Model Y gross margin was higher than our prior year total automotive gross margin. These increases were partially offset by idle capacity charges of $213 million as a result of a temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment increased from 17% to 22% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a lower proportion of services and other, which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business, within the segment in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, there was an improvement in our non-warranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2020 compared to 2019 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $635 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack, higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our Solar Roof ramp, increases in deployments of Powerwall and idle capacity charges of $20 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory New York during the first half of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack. Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12% to 1% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in our overall energy business which operated at lower gross margins as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp. Additionally, there were lower gross margins in our solar cash and loan business from reduced average selling prices as a result of our low cost solar strategy, partially offset by lower materials and manufacturing costs. Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Research and development $ 1,491 $ 1,343 $ 1,460 $ 148 11 % $ (117 ) -8 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 5 % 7 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. 43 R&D expenses increased $148 million, or 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $62 million increase in expensed materials as we continue to expand our product roadmap, $61 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price, $20 million increase in facilities, freight and depreciation expenses and a $20 million increase in employee and labor related expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5.5% to 4.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily an increase in total revenues from expanding sales, partially offset by an increase in our R&D expenses as detailed above. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,145 $ 2,646 $ 2,835 $ 499 19 % $ (189 ) -7 % As a percentage of revenues 10 % 11 % 13 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses increased $499 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $625 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $542 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $838 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 for the 2018 CEO Performance Award compared to $296 million in the prior year. Of the expense recorded in fiscal year 2020, $232 million was due to cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided from the grant date when three operational milestones under such award were considered probable of being met and the remaining unamortized expense of $357 million for the first four tranches were recognized upon vesting as the first four market capitalization milestones were achieved (see Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The remaining stock-based compensation expense increase of $83 million attributable to other directors and employees is primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price. The increase in stock-based compensation was partially offset by a decrease of $90 million in customer promotional costs, facilities-related expenses and sales and marketing activities. Additionally, there was a reduction to operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the amount of $43 million for the settlement in part of the securities litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition (see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11% to 10% in year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily from an increase in total revenues from expanding sales, partially offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses as detailed above. Restructuring and other Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ — $ 149 $ 135 $ (149 ) -100% $ 14 10% As a percentage of revenues 0 % 1 % 1 % During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. There were no restructuring actions in the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (748 ) $ (685 ) $ (663 ) $ (63 ) 9 % $ (22 ) 3 % As a percentage of revenues 2 % 3 % 3 % 44 Interest expense increased by $63 million, or 9%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to $105 million of losses on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 2020 from early conversions on our convertible senior notes, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate as compared to the prior year and an increase of $17 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statements of operations to property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Increased capitalization results in lower interest expense. The amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance, which increased year-over-year due to our construction and expansion of multiple factories. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Other (expense) income, net $ (122 ) $ 45 $ 22 $ (167 ) Not meaningful $ 23 105% As a percentage of revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $167 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unfavorable change was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the U.S. dollar depreciating greater than 5% against the euro and the Chinese yuan in 2020 compared to an appreciation of 2% and 1% against the same currencies in the prior year, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 292 $ 110 $ 58 $ 182 165 % $ 52 90 % Effective tax rate 25 % -17 % -6 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $182 million, or 165%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the substantial increases in taxable profits in our foreign jurisdictions year-over-year. Our effective tax rate increased from -17% to 25% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to substantial pre-tax income in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Change 2019 vs. 2018 Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 $ % $ % Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ 141 $ 87 $ (87 ) $ 54 62% $ 174 Not meaningful Our net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by $54 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we had $19.38 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $6.76 billion and consisted primarily of euros, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollars. Our sources of cash are 45 predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products and technologies including our announced proprietary battery cells, ongoing production and additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2021 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be $4.50 to $6.00 billion in 2021 and in each of the next two fiscal years. We expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations, although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to support construction and production at Gigafactory Shanghai. See Note 12, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018, which we expect to meet through our operations. As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a one-year deferral of our obligation to be compliant as of April 30, 2020 with our applicable targets under such agreement. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months, even considering the expected levels of capital expenditures in the current and next two fiscal years. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic conditions and levels of consumer outlook and spend impacting demand in the worldwide transportation, automotive and energy product industries, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. In addition, we had $2.63 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2020, some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets; and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds). For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 12, Debt, and Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,943 $ 2,405 $ 2,098 Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,132 ) $ (1,436 ) $ (2,337 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 9,973 $ 1,529 $ 574 46 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital, especially inventory, which includes vehicles in transit. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, customer lease payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.54 billion to $5.94 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.40 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $2.82 billion, the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $533 million and $188 million of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 (which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity, as this represented an interest payment on the deeply-discounted convertible senior notes). The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of December 31, 2019, a larger increase in operating lease vehicles as Model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and Model Y direct leasing was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly for Model Y production expansion at the Fremont Factory, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, and $1.33 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly for Gigafactory Shanghai construction, Model 3 production ramp and Model Y preparations. The increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by decreases of $32 million in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and $30 million of design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems when compared to the prior year. Additionally, we received $123 million and $46 million, respectively, of government grants in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $12.27 billion from issuance of common stock in public offerings in 2020, net of issuance costs, and $417 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were partially offset by $1.99 billion of cash repayments upon early conversions of our convertible senior notes, $338 million principal repayments of our finance leases, collateralized lease repayments of $240 million and $219 million net payments to financing fund investors. See Note 12, Debt, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $1.82 billion from the issuance of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”), net of transaction costs, and $848 million from the issuance of common stock, net of underwriting discounts, in registered public offerings, $736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain Chinese subsidiaries, $394 million of net borrowings for automotive asset-backed notes and $174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes. These cash inflows were partially offset by a $732 million portion of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing activity, a $566 million repayment of our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, a purchase of convertible note hedges of $476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes and collateralized lease repayments of $389 million. 47 Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing facilities and certain corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in millions): Year Ended December 31, Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest $ 1,846 $ 366 $ 327 $ 279 $ 245 $ 204 $ 425 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest 1,635 462 446 412 299 9 7 Purchase obligations (1) 18,318 10,483 2,743 2,280 1,877 865 70 Debt, including scheduled interest (2) 11,695 2,100 2,172 2,602 2,021 2,109 691 Total $ 33,494 $ 13,411 $ 5,688 $ 5,573 $ 4,442 $ 3,187 $ 1,193 (1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $5.95 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2020 and (ii) $12.37 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2020, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such date or, where applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020. (2) This includes non-recourse debt repayments, including scheduled interest, of $5.16 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. Short-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $342 million. Long-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the years thereafter is $1.13 billion. The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $353 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners (refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs, should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options, would be $1.84 billion over the next five years, of which $394 million is within a 12-month period from December 31, 2020. We have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options. Additionally, we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore, the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 48 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a net foreign currency loss of $114 million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the U.S. dollar, euro and Canadian dollar as our subsidiaries’ monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in various local currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $48 million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the U.S. dollar, British pound and Canadian dollar. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a benefit of $8 million at December 31, 2020 and an adverse impact of $362 million at December 31, 2019 assuming no foreign currency hedging. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 by $4 million and $8 million, respectively. 49",2023-12-31 03:12:57.125470
