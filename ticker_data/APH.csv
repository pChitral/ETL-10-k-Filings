820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2004,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2003 approximately 55% of the Company's sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: •communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; •a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications and; •commercial and military aerospace applications. The Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of net sales in 2003. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as 14 it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company's strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Company's strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: •Focus on customer needs •Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions •Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities •Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure •Maintain a culture of controlling cost •Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,240 million, $204 million and $104 million, respectively; up 17%, 18% and 29%, respectively, from 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased in each of the Company's major markets and geographic regions; sales of cable products were stable with the prior year. Net income benefited from both the increase in operating income and reduced interest expense. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in ""Results of Operations"" below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to reduce indebtedness. In 2003, the Company reduced debt by approximately $107 million. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 66.2 65.9 63.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.0 3.3 2.9 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.3 14.4 14.1 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 Operating income 16.5 16.4 17.9 Interest expense (2.4 ) (4.3 ) (5.1 ) Other expenses, net (.6 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.8 ) Income before income taxes 12.7 11.6 12.3 Provision for income taxes (4.3 ) (4.0 ) (4.7 ) Net income 8.4 % 7.6 % 7.6 % 15 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales were $1,239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,062.0 million for 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20% compared to 2002 ($1,072.0 million in 2003 versus $892.3 million in 2002). Sales increased in the Company's major end markets including military/aerospace, mobile communications, industrial, automotive and computer/data communications markets. The increases occurred in all major geographic regions, with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation, as detailed below. The remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company's major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $47 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe, and an acquisition ($8 million). The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $42 million) is attributable to the acquisition of companies in North America and China serving the network infrastructure market (approximately $18 million) and increases in Asia in sales of handset products. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $36 million) reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in North America (approximately $16 million) and increased sales in Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $33 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $23 million; a cable assembly acquisition in North America contributed one third of the increase, the remainder reflects increased sales in Europe and Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 1% compared to 2002 ($167.5 million in 2003 versus $169.7 million in 2002). Such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2003 increased approximately 11% compared to 2002 ($555.9 million in 2003 versus $501.1 million in 2002); international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($683.6 million in 2003 versus $560.9 million in 2002) and increased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2002. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $63.9 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained constant at 31% for 2003 and 2002. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year, the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas. The increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6% compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177.4 million and $152.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $2.2 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, remained stable, commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.9 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $29.5 million for 2003 compared to $45.9 million for 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the 16 second quarter of 2003 (see liquidity and capital resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2004 is expected to be approximately $23 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company's senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Company's Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net for 2003 and 2002 was $7.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($1.3 million in 2003 and $2.7 million in 2002), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.5 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($2.4 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002) and agency and commitment fees on the Company's credit facilities ($.8 million in 2003 and $.6 million in 2002). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds), and in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34% compared to 34.5% in 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002 versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. These declines occurred primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets. Major OEM customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure (including wireless) and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. The increase in sales of military aerospace products (approximately $12 million), relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in North America. The increase in automotive sales (approximately $11 million) occurred primarily in North America and relates to the increasing use of electronic componentry in automobiles. The increase in sales in the wireless handset market (approximately $15 million), reflects the strong market for these products in Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus $197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect 17 on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs relating to purchased materials and services and a shift of headcount from high cost to low cost labor areas. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $152.9 million and $155.8 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $1.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the Broadband market, declined approximately $2.6 million, commensurate with sales declines for those products. Administrative expenses were down by approximately $1.5 million due to a reduction in compensation cost. Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No.142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million in 2001. Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($2.7 million loss in 2002 and $1.4 million gain in 2001), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2002 and strength in 2001, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.8 million in 2002 and $3.9 million in 2001), reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2002, minority interests ($1.8 million in 2002 and 2001) and agency and commitment fees on the Company's credit facilities ($.6 million in 2002 and $.5 million in 2001). In addition, in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 34.5% compared to 38.2% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non-deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $159.4 million, $131.6 million and $118.9 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income partially offset by a smaller reduction in the 2003 period in non-cash components of working capital. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non-cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $1.0 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, and an increase of $10.2 million in accrued liabilities partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $15.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9 million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels. The non-cash components of working capital increased $10.0 million in 2001. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities declined $74.9 million, $44.2 million and $34.5 million, respectively, for a net $3.8 million increase in the non-cash components of working capital. These reductions were driven primarily by lower sales volume, and in the case of accrued liabilities, increased income tax payments. Inventory increased approximately $2.8 million; inventory turnover which had improved to 4.6x in 2000 as sales levels significantly increased, returned to historical levels of approximately 3.5x in 2001. In addition, accrued interest declined $2.1 million. 18 In 2003, accounts receivable increased $41.2 million to $172.5 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $9.5 million from acquired companies, and a $13.5 million increase due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, remained constant at 66 days. Inventory increased $15.7 million to $221.4 million, primarily due to an increase of $12.9 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, and $7.4 million in inventory from acquired companies which more than offset the operating reduction of $4.6 million. Inventory turnover increased to 3.9x at December 31, 2003 from 3.5x at December 31, 2002. Deferred taxes and other assets decreased $9.4 million to $28.4 million reflecting the decrease in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $29.5 million to $516.3 million as a result of acquisitions completed in 2003. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $17.6 million to $178.3 million reflecting capital expenditures of $30.2 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $11.6 million, an increase of $12.3 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, and depreciation of $36.5 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $28.3 million and $6.5 million to $116.8 million and $31.1 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels, liabilities from acquired companies and a $5.7 million and $1.7 million increase, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. Other accrued liabilities increased $16.6 million to $56.1 million relating primarily to an increase in accrued income taxes, liabilities for the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($30.2 million, $18.8 million and $38.6 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively), and acquisitions ($51.1 million, $33.8 million and $60.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively). In 2003, cash from operating activities of $159.4 million, proceeds from the refinancing of $27.0 million, additional sales of receivables of $10.6 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $35.9 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $30.2 million, acquisitions of $51.1 million, an increase in cash on hand of $2.9 million and for a net debt reduction of $148.8 million. For 2002, cash from operating activities of $131.6 million, cash on hand of $7.3 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $5.8 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million, acquisitions of $13.0 million, a reduction in sales of receivables of $11.0 million and a net reduction in bank debt of $81.0 million. During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. Borrowings of $625.0 million under a new bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement), described below, were used to repay $439.5 million outstanding under the Company's previous bank agreement, redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling $148.7 million (including the call premium of $4.7 million) and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of $8.9 million. A prepayment of the new bank loan of $37.0 million was made in June with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of $89.0 million were made in the second half of 2003. The refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the Company's debt coming due in 2003 through 2007. The Company's new Bank Agreement includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2003, the Tranche A had a balance of $90.0 million and matures over the period 2006 to 2008, and the Tranche B had a balance of $409.0 million and matures in 2010. The revolving credit facility expires in 2008; availability under the facility at December 31, 2003 was $117.2 million, after a reduction of $7.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Company's interest rate on loans under the new Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 19 200 basis points. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company's direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Company's credit rating as assigned by Standard & Poor's or Moody's were to decline to BB- or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Company's U.S. based assets. At December 31, 2003, the Company's credit rating from Standard and Poor's was BB+ and from Moody's was Ba2. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.8x. At December 31, 2003, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement, were 7.82x and 2.49x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50 million for capital leases, $200 million for general indebtedness and $200 million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $2.1 million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2003, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Company's Common Stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income, or approximately $39.0 million at December 31, 2003. In conjunction with entering into the new Bank Agreement the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. The Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company's revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Company's accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company's sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company's products, a deterioration in certain of the Company's financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company's accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2004 will be approximately $40 million. The Company's required debt and capital lease amortization in 2004 is $10.7 million; the Company's required cash interest payments for 2004, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $22 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock; however, this policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Management believes that the Company's working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2004. It is the Company's intention to renew or replace the agreement at expiration on similar terms. At December 31, 2003, approximately $73.8 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 20 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 ""Honeywell""), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company's products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will be effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares to be distributed on or before March 29, 2004. The share information included herein does not reflect the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.146 (FAS 146), ""Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities"". The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. There was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), ""Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others"". The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a 21 guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and have no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure"". FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"" and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In January and December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46), ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"". It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. The Company adopted this interpretation in 2003 and there was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (FAS 149), ""Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."" This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."" This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), ""Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity."" This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. The statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132R (FAS 132R), ""Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits."" FAS 132R amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 132 to require additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost. The statement is effective in 2003 and the related disclosures have been included in Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (""Plan"") covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense (credit) for all pension plans approximated $6.5 million, $.7 million and $(.3) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical fourteen year compounded return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2003, our asset allocation was 63% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2003 and 2004. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.5% at December 31, 2002 to 6.15% at December 31, 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2004 by approximately $.8 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $11.6 million or increased $12.8 million, respectively. The financial markets declined significantly in 2002, which had an adverse effect on Plan assets. This resulted in a $42.5 million non-cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders' equity. Such charge represented an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company made a cash contribution to the U.S. pension plans in 2003 of $10.0 million. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations declined modestly in 2003 to $100.3 million from $102.4 million in 2002, as the positive impact on assets of improved investment returns was offset by the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non-U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2004 of approximately $10 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 23 Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company's significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition—Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories—Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets—Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company's known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2003, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years (dollars in thousands) Long-Term Debt $ 541,076 $ 9,588 $ 37,088 $ 85,092 $ 409,308 Capital Lease Obligations 1,883 1,091 792 Operating Leases 40,404 13,424 15,663 6,417 4,900 Purchase Obligations 58,199 57,220 870 109 Other Long-Term Liabilities 8,179 6,691 1,205 205 78 Total $ 649,741 $ 88,014 $ 55,618 $ 91,823 $ 414,286 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company's sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company's worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. 24 Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above. In conjunction with the refinancing, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2003, the Company's average LIBOR rate was 1.8%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2003 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.1 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2004, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 25",2023-12-30 21:46:43.438413
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2003,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 65.9 63.8 65.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.3 2.9 2.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.4 14.1 13.7 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 1.0 Operating income 16.4 17.9 18.0 Interest expense (4.3 ) (5.1 ) (4.6 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.7 ) Income before income taxes 11.6 12.3 12.7 Provision for income taxes (4.0 ) (4.7 ) (4.8 ) Net income 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.9 % 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002 versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus $197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs. The pricing environment in communication related markets is expected to remain difficult in the near term. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both 2002 and 2001. Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No. 142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million in 2001. Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is 14 primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2003 is expected to be approximately $35 million. Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 35% compared to 38% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non-deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales were $1,103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1,359.7 million for 2000. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 10% compared to 2000 ($906.8 million in 2001 versus $1,009.2 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace and automotive markets. Sales of cable products decreased 44% compared to 2000 ($197.0 million in 2001 versus $350.5 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain U.S. and international cable television operators. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2001 decreased approximately 25% compared to 2000 ($538.9 million in 2001 versus $714.8 million in 2000); international sales for 2001 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($564.8 million in 2001 versus $644.9 million in 2000) and decreased approximately 9% in local currency compared to 2000. The comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $22.8 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2000. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained relatively constant at approximately 33% for both 2001 and 2000. Cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both 2001 and 2000. Interest expense was $56.1 million for 2001 compared to $61.7 million for 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other expenses, net for 2001 and 2000 was $5.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 38% for both 2001 and 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $131.6 million, $118.9 million, and $154.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non-cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. In 2001, the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and to a net increase in non-cash components of working capital. Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($18.8 million, $38.6 million and $53.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively), and acquisitions ($33.8 million, $60.5 million, and $67.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement) which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $150 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of $179.5 million and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had a balance of $284.5 million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving credit facility expires in 2004; and, availability under the facility at December 31, 2002 was $142.8 million, after reduction of $7.2 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company’s direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement also requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and 15 includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness and restricted payments, including dividends on the Company’s common stock. The Company is currently pursuing a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. The new credit facilities would be used to replace the Company’s existing credit facilities, and may be used to redeem all or a portion of the Company’s outstanding senior subordinated notes. A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60.0 million of accounts receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional $25.0 million of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, approximately $63.2 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (“Notes”). The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2003 will be approximately $28 million. The Company’s required debt and capital lease amortization in 2003 is $78.4 million; the Company’s required cash interest payments for 2003, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $33 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2002, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Long-Term Debt $ 642,275 $ 77,026 $ 234,574 $ 330,675 Capital Lease Obligations 1,973 1,337 636 Operating Leases 37,820 12,968 13,376 4,923 6,553 Purchase Obligations 39,958 37,633 2,015 223 87 Other Long-Term Liabilities 3,250 1,125 1,125 1,000 Total $ 725,276 $ 130,089 $ 251,726 $ 336,821 $ 6,640 16 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials. Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. FAS No. 143 addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. FAS No. 144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. There was no effect to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The statement is effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and had no material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 17 (FAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure”. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”. It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“Plan”) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. Our pension cost (credit) for all pension plans approximated $.7 million, $(.3) million and $(.3) million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical 13 year compounded return of 10.8%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2002 was 50% with equity managers and 50% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption by 100 basis points to 9.5% beginning in 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at December 31, 2001 to 6.5% at December 31, 2002. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $9.5 million or increased $10.4 million, respectively. The financial markets have declined significantly in recent years, which has had an adverse effect on Plan assets. In 2002, this resulted in a $42.5 million non-cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders’ equity. Such charge represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company estimates that, based on 18 current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plans in 2003 of approximately $7.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital; although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company had two fixed rate interest swap agreements totaling $450 million that expired in 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 1.9%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2002 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2003, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 19",2023-12-30 21:46:40.488291
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2004 approximately 56% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: • communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; • a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications; and • commercial and military aerospace applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales in 2004. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: • Focus on customer needs • Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions • Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities • Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure • Maintain a culture of controlling cost • Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,530.4 million, $276.6 million and $163.3 million, respectively; up 23%, 35% and 57%, respectively, from 2003. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in each of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Net income benefited from both the increase in operating income and reduced interest expense. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, one strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock and to reduce indebtedness. In 2004, the Company generated operating cash flow of $208.3 million of which $100.3 million was used to reduce debt. 14 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 65.3 66.2 65.9 Depreciation and amortization expense 2.5 3.0 3.3 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.1 14.3 14.4 Operating income 18.1 16.5 16.4 Interest expense (1.5 ) (2.4 ) (4.3 ) Other expenses, net (.4 ) (.6 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt — (.8 ) — Income before income taxes 16.2 12.7 11.6 Provision for income taxes (5.5 ) (4.3 ) (4.0 ) Net income 10.7 % 8.4 % 7.6 % 15 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales were $1,530.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,239.5 million for 2003 an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to 2003 ($1,333.8 million in 2004 versus $1,072.0 million in 2003). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets and the impact of acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 ($50.3 million). Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including mobile communications, industrial, automotive, military/aerospace, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $105.7 million) is attributable primarily to increased demand on wireless infrastructure products in all regions, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions during 2003 of companies in North America and China serving the wireless installation market. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $49 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $34 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America, reflecting the increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $63.9 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $11.1 million reflecting increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia and the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products increased 17% compared to 2003 ($196.6 million in 2004 versus $167.5 million in 2003). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2004 increased approximately 21% compared to 2003 ($674.3 million in 2004 versus $555.9 million in 2003); international sales for 2004 increased approximately 25% in U.S. dollars ($856.1 million in 2004 versus $683.6 million in 2003) and increased approximately 19% in local currency compared to 2003. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2004 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $46.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2003. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 32% in 2004 compared to 31% in 2003. An increase in margins was achieved in both the interconnect products and assemblies segment and the cable segment although the cable segment increase was partially offset by a continued increase in material costs. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost controls. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $215.0 million and $177.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and remained approximately 14.0% of sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $6.1 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2004 and 2003. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $11.8 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions, medical benefits and professional fees. Interest expense was $22.5 million for 2004 compared to $29.5 million for 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $19 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2004 and 2003 were $6.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($0.6 million in 2004 and $1.3 million in 2003), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($2.3 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($3.0 million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003) and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.0 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds). See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 34.0% in 2004 and 2003. 16 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales were $1,239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,062.0 million for 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20% compared to 2002 ($1,072.0 million in 2003 versus $892.3 million in 2002). Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including military/aerospace, mobile communications, industrial, automotive and computer/data communications markets. The increases occurred in all major geographic regions, with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation, as detailed below. The remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $47 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe, and an acquisition ($8 million). The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $42 million) is attributable to the acquisition of companies in North America and China serving the network infrastructure market (approximately $18 million) and increases in Asia in sales of handset products. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $36 million) reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in North America (approximately $16 million) and increased sales in Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $33 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $23 million; a cable assembly acquisition in North America contributed one-third of the increase and the remainder reflects increased sales in Europe and Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 1% compared to 2002 ($167.5 million in 2003 versus $169.7 million in 2002). Such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2003 increased approximately 11% compared to 2002 ($555.9 million in 2003 versus $501.1 million in 2002); international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($683.6 million in 2003 versus $560.9 million in 2002) and increased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2002. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $63.9 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained constant at 31% for 2003 and 2002. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year, the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas. The increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6% compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177.4 million and $152.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $2.2 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, remained stable, commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.9 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $29.5 million for 2003 compared to $45.9 million for 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2003 and 2002 was $7.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($1.3 million in 2003 and $2.7 million in 2002), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.5 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($2.4 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002) and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($0.8 million in 2003 and $0.6 million in 2002). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds), and in 2002 the Company realized $1.5 million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34% compared to 34.5% in 2002. 17 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $208.3 million, $170.0 million and $120.6 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the Company reclassified certain amounts in its 2003 and 2002 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow from financing activities to operating activities as a result of a determination that they had not been reported in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 95 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The amounts reclassified of $10.6 and ($11.0) million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, reflect a change in classification of the net change in the accounts receivables sold under the Company’s accounts receivable securitization agreement. As a result of these reclassifications, there was no impact on the Company’s net change in cash and short-term cash investments in 2003 and 2002. The net change during 2004 in accounts receivables sold under the Company’s accounts receivable securitization agreement which is included in operating activities is $6.2 million. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income in addition to a larger reduction in the non-cash components of working capital compared to 2003, partially offset by a larger decrease in long-term liabilities resulting from a $20 million contribution to the Company's pension plan in 2004 (compared to a $10 million contribution in 2003). The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and a larger reduction in the 2003 period in non-cash components of working capital. The non - cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in 2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory. The non - cash components of working capital decreased $11.6 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, an increase of $10.6 million in receivables sold, and an increase in accrued income taxes of $18.0 million partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and a decrease of $7.7 million in accrued liabilities. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $4.8 million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9 million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels, a $6.2 million increase in accrued income taxes and a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in receivables sold and a $6.5 million reduction in accrued liabilities. In 2004, accounts receivable increased $41.7 million to $214.2 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $12.6 million from an acquired company, and a $9.3 million increase due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, decreased to approximately 64 days from 66 days in 2003. Inventory increased $25.9 million to $247.3 million, primarily due to an increase of $6.7 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, and $4.7 million in inventory from an acquired company coupled with an operating addition of $14.5 million. Inventory turnover increased to 4.2x at December 31, 2004 from 3.9x at December 31, 2003. Deferred taxes and other assets decreased $0.3 million to $28.1 million reflecting the decrease in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note 3 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $29.1 million to $545.4 million primarily as a result of an acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2004 as well as additional contingent consideration paid in 2004 relating to a prior year acquisition. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $19.5 million to $197.8 million reflecting capital expenditures of $44.3 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $6.8 million, an increase of $7.8 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, depreciation of $38.2 million and disposals of $1.2 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $18.0 million and $7.4 million to $134.9 million and $38.5 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels, liabilities assumed from acquired companies and a $0.8 million and $0.3 million increase, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. Accrued income taxes increased $23.7 million due primarily to increased profits. Other accrued liabilities increased $5.3 million to $37.1 million relating primarily to an increase in liabilities for the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. In 2004, cash from operating activities of $208.3 million (including additional sales of receivables of $6.2 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $30.3 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $44.3 million, acquisitions of $41.8 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $45.6 million, an increase in cash on hand of $6.6 million and for a net debt reduction of $100.3 million. For 2003, cash from operating activities of $170.0 million (including additional sales of receivables of $10.6 million), proceeds from the refinancing of $27.0 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $35.9 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $30.2 million, acquisitions of $51.1 million, an increase in cash on hand of $2.9 million and for a net debt reduction of $148.8 million. During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. During 2003 borrowings of $625.0 million under a new bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement), described below, were used to repay $439.5 million outstanding under the Company’s previous bank agreement, redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling $148.7 million (including the call premium of $4.7 million) and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of $8.9 million. A prepayment of the new bank loan of $37.0 million was made in June with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of $89.0 million were made in the second half of 2003. The 2003 refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the Company’s debt coming due in 2003 through 2007. In November 2004, the Company amended the credit agreement. The primary effects of the amendment were to lower interest cost, and reduce limitations relative to additional indebtedness and restricted payments including repurchase of the Company’s common stock and dividends. 18 The Company’s new Bank Agreement includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2004, the Tranche A had a balance of $13.0 million and matures in 2008, and the Tranche B had a balance of $400.0 million and matures over the period 2005 to 2010 with annual payments of $4 million and a balloon payment due at maturity. The revolving credit facility expires in 2008; availability under the facility at December 31, 2004 was $116.2 million, after a reduction of $8.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Company’s interest rate on loans under the new Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company’s direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Company’s credit rating as assigned by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s were to decline to BB- or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Company’s U.S.-based assets. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s credit rating from Standard and Poor’s was BB+ and from Moody’s was Ba1. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.75x and 3.50x based on total debt and senior debt, respectively. At December 31, 2004, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement, were 12.91x, 1.65x and 1.65x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50 million for capital leases, $450 million for general indebtedness and $200 million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $6.9 million, $0 and $4.2, respectively, were outstanding at December 31, 2004, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Company’s Common Stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income plus $50 million, or approximately $170.6 million at December 31, 2004. In conjunction with entering into the new Bank Agreement the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $50.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 3.01%, expiring in May 2006 and June 2006, respectively. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2005 will be approximately $50 million. The Company’s required debt and capital lease amortization in 2005 is $16.9 million; the Company’s required cash interest payments for 2005, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $19 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. Since its initial public offering in 1991, the Company has not paid any dividends. However, on January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it will commence payment of a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company expects the first dividend payment to be made on or about April 6, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2005. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2007. At December 31, 2004, approximately $80.0 million ($73.8 million at December 31, 2003) of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) in December 1999, Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to 19 perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, No. 123R (“FAS 123R”) “Share-based payment”. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments) in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant-date (with limited exceptions). This statement is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this statement will have on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, but does not anticipate the impact to be more than $2 million per quarter based on the options outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act introduced a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare (“Medicare Part D”), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at a minimum actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FASB Staff Position (“FSP”), 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” was provided by the FASB to offer guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for the Act. The Company does not believe the new Act will have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151 (“FAS 151”), “Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” in an effort to conform U.S. accounting standards for inventories to International Accounting Standards. FAS 151 requires idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) costs to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the relevant production facilities. FAS 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard but does not believe that it will have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“Plan”) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $10.1 million, $6.5 million and $0.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical fifteen-year compounded return of 10.1%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2004, our asset allocation was 65% with equity managers and 35% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2004 and 2003. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.15% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2005 by approximately $1.9 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $13.2 million or increased $14.5 million, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $20 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2004 to $102.1 million from $100.3 million in 2003, due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non-U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2005 of approximately $10 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance with FAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2004, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt $ 442,688 $ 14,341 $ 15,462 $ 31,939 $ 380,946 Capital lease obligations 6,365 2,568 3,763 34 — Operating leases 48,708 16,546 17,682 9,127 5,353 Purchase obligations 76,537 74,589 1,402 546 — Other long-term liabilities 7,275 803 6,394 78 — Total $ 581,573 $ 108,847 $ 44,703 $ 41,724 $ 386,299 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2003 refinancing, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $50.0 million of floating rate debt at 2.44% and 3.01%, expiring in May 2006 and June 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 2.5%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2004 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2005, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 22",2023-12-30 21:46:38.961478
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2005, approximately 56% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: • communication systems and information technology applications; • a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation and natural resource exploration, and automotive applications; and • commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales in 2005. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: • Focus on customer needs • Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions • Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities • Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure • Maintain a culture of controlling costs • Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,808.1 million, $343.3 million and $206.3 million, respectively; up 18%, 24% and 26%, respectively, from 2004. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in each of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, one strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2005, the Company generated operating cash flow of $229.6 million. 16 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 64.3 65.3 66.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 2.8 2.5 3.0 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.0 14.1 14.3 Operating income 18.9 18.1 16.5 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.5 ) (2.4 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.4 ) (.6 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.1 ) — (.8 ) Income before income taxes 17.0 16.2 12.7 Provision for income taxes (5.6 ) (5.5 ) (4.3 ) Net income 11.4 % 10.7 % 8.4 % 17 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales were $1,808.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,530.4 million for 2004 an increase of 18% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. The increase in sales over 2004 excluding acquisitions was 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 19% in U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to 2004 ($1,592.4 million in 2005 versus $1,333.8 million in 2004). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets and the impact of acquisitions. Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including mobile communications, military/aerospace, industrial, automotive, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $92.7 million) is attributable to increased demand for wireless infrastructure products for cell site installations in North America, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $24.1 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe and the impact of acquisitions. Automotive sales increased approximately $33.7 million primarily in Europe, reflecting the impact of an acquisition in late 2004. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $57.8 million) relates to increased demand on military programs, avionics applications in North America and the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $45.8 million reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased sales in Asia for disk drive and storage applications. Sales of cable products increased 10% compared to 2004 ($215.7 million in 2005 versus $196.6 million in 2004). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2005 increased approximately 19% compared to 2004 ($802.4 million in 2005 versus $674.3 million in 2004); international sales for 2005 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,005.8 million in 2005 versus $856.1 million in 2004) and increased approximately 17% in local currency compared to 2004. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2005 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $7.0 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2004. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 33% in 2005 compared to 32% in 2004. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment and was partially offset by a decline in margins in the cable segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. The decrease in cable margins was due to the impact of a continued increase in material costs which was not fully offset by price increases implemented during the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $252.2 million and $215.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, approximately 14.0% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $7.6 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2005 and 2004. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $24.1 million for 2005 compared to $22.5 million for 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially offset by the effect of the refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2005 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and higher average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2006 is expected to be approximately $40 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. Other expenses, net, for 2005 and 2004 were $8.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) ($0.4 million in 2005 and $(0.6) million in 2004), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004, program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.8 million in 2005 and $2.3 million in 2004), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2005, minority interests ($4.1 million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2004) and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.5 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004) primarily due to higher commitment fees. See Note 10 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 33.0% in 2005 and 34% in 2004. The reduction in the tax rate in 2005 relates primarily to lower U.S. income taxes resulting from the impact of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 18 2004 Compared to 2003 Net sales were $1,530.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,239.5 million for 2003 an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to 2003 ($1,333.8 million in 2004 versus $1,072.0 million in 2003). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets and the impact of acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 ($50.3 million). Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including mobile communications, industrial, automotive, military/aerospace, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $105.7 million) is attributable primarily to increased demand on wireless infrastructure products in all regions, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions during 2003 of companies in North America and China serving the wireless installation market. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $49 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $34 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America, reflecting the increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $63.9 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $11.1 million reflecting increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia and the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products increased 17% compared to 2003 ($196.6 million in 2004 versus $167.5 million in 2003). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2004 increased approximately 21% compared to 2003 ($674.3 million in 2004 versus $555.9 million in 2003); international sales for 2004 increased approximately 25% in U.S. dollars ($856.1 million in 2004 versus $683.6 million in 2003) and increased approximately 19% in local currency compared to 2003. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2004 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $46.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2003. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 32% in 2004 compared to 31% in 2003. An increase in margins was achieved in both the interconnect products and assemblies segment and the cable segment although the cable segment increase was partially offset by a continued increase in material costs. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost controls. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $215.0 million and $177.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and remained approximately 14.0% of sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $6.1 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2004 and 2003. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $11.8 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions, medical benefits and professional fees. Interest expense was $22.5 million for 2004 compared to $29.5 million for 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $19 million. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8 million. Other expenses, net, for 2004 and 2003 were $6.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($0.6 million in 2004 and $1.3 million in 2003), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($2.3 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($3.0 million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003) and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.0 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds). See Note 10 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 34.0% in 2004 and 2003. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $229.6 million, $208.3 million and $170.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating cash flow includes $5.0 million, $6.2 million and $10.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulting from an increase in sale of receivables under the Company’s receivable securitization program. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to a decrease in 2004. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income in addition to a larger reduction in the non-cash components of working capital compared to 2003. The non-cash components of working capital increased $37.2 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and $21.1 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in 2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $11.6 million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, an increase of $10.6 million in receivables sold, and an increase in accrued income taxes of $18.0 million, partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and a decrease of $7.7 million in accrued liabilities. In 2005, accounts receivable increased $88.7 million to $302.9 million, due to an increase in sales levels and $71.7 million from acquired companies, offset by $13.8 million due to translation and by a $5.0 million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, increased to approximately 65 days from 64 days in 2004. Inventory increased $78.6 million to $325.9 million, primarily due to an increase of $60.4 million in inventory from acquired companies coupled with an operating addition of $27.5 million partially offset by $9.3 million of translation resulting from the comparatively strong U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Inventory turnover remained constant at 4.2x at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets increased $386.7 million to $934.1 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $56.1 million to $253.9 million reflecting net capital expenditures of $57.1 million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $57.7 million, partially offset by $9.0 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 and depreciation of $49.7 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $42.4 million and $4.2 million to $177.3 million and $42.7 million, respectively, due to an increase in sales levels and liabilities assumed from acquired companies partially offset by a $4.8 million and $1.9 million decrease, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Other accrued liabilities increased $13.7 million to $50.8 million relating primarily to liabilities related to the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume. In 2005, cash from operating activities of $229.6 million (including additional sales of receivables of $5.0 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $36.4 million and net borrowings under the Company’s bank agreements of $331.1 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $57.1 million, payment of dividends of $8.0 million, acquisitions of $512.3 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $8.7 million, and an increase in cash on hand of $8.5 million. For 2004, cash from operating activities of $208.3 million (including additional sales of receivables of $6.2 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $30.3 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $44.3 million, acquisitions of $41.8 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $45.6 million, an increase in cash on hand of $6.6 million and for a net debt reduction of $100.3 million. On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (Revolving Credit Facility) is comprised of a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2010, of which approximately $440 million was drawn at closing. The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company’s previous senior credit facility and for working capital purposes. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million. At December 31, 2005, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $267.6 million, after a reduction of $11.5 million for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less tax effects of $0.8 million) or $.02 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The Company also 20 pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s was Ba1. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.50X; at December 31, 2005, such ratios as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 9.04X and 1.96X, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $200.0 million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $8.6 million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2005, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Company’s Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $301.3 million at December 31, 2005, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0 million, or approximately $512.4 million at December 31, 2005, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets. In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0, $250.0 and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. While it is not the Company’s intention to terminate the interest rate swap agreements, the fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2005 would have resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.9 million; such gain, net of tax, of $0.8 was recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2006 will be approximately $75 million. The Company’s required debt and capital lease amortization in 2006 is approximately $15.0 million. The Company’s required cash interest payments for 2006, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $40 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company paid its fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or $.03 per share on January 4, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2005. Cumulative dividends declared during 2005 were $10.8 million of which $8.0 million were paid in 2005. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2007. At December 31, 2005, approximately $85.0 million ($80.0 million at December 31, 2004) of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 TCS Acquisition On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company and Teradyne Corporation, Inc., a Massachusetts Corporation (“Teradyne”). The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne’s backplane and connection systems business segment (“TCS”), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share. TCS is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired through the use of independent appraisals and management’s estimates. It is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment. In connection with the acquisition the Company recorded $239.3 million of goodwill and $45.5 million of acquired intangible assets of which $30.4 million, $9.0 million and $6.1 million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. For The Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2005 2004 Net sales $ 2,146,286 $ 1,940,834 Operating income 347,301 304,451 Net income 195,675 166,746 Net income per common share - Basic $ 2.21 $ 1.89 Net income per common share - Diluted 2.16 1.86 To supplement the pro forma combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current and expected financial performance and are “forward looking”. The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does not expect to reoccur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Company’s operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company’s ongoing combined operations. 22 For The Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2005 2004 Benefit of reduction in employee related benefits (i) $ 1,969 $ 3,430 Benefit of reduction in Teradyne historical corporate allocations (ii) 7,505 8,000 Reversal of nonrecurring restructuring costs (iii) 11,654 4,148 Reversal of nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business (iv) (612 ) (865 ) Total $ 20,516 $ 14,713 (i) In conjunction with the acquisition, TCS’s historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCS’s historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred. (ii) Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services historically performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition. (iii) Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings. (iv) TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005 which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur in the future. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) in December 1999, Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. 23 Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (“FAS”) 123R “Share-Based Payment”. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments) in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant date (with limited exceptions). In April 2005, the effective date of this statement was deferred and was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has adopted FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of adoption of FAS 123R is expected to result in approximately $10.0 million of (pre-tax) expense during 2006 although it will depend in part on the level of share-based payments granted. Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“Plan”) covering U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $13.5 million, $10.1 million and $6.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical sixteen-year compounded return of 11.3%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2005, our asset allocation was 66% with equity managers and 34% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2005 and 2004. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 5.75% at December 31, 2004 to 5.50% at December 31, 2005. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2006 by approximately $.7 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $15.0 million or increased $15.5 million, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $10.0 million and $20.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2005 to $108.8 million from $102.1 million in 2004, due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non-U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the pension plan in 2006 of approximately $10.0 to 15.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. 24 Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicate that an allowance is appropriate. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance with FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt $ 772,399 $ 11,363 $ 2,733 $ 757,256 $ 1,047 Capital lease obligations 8,601 3,667 4,934 — — Operating leases 58,688 17,712 23,362 10,895 6,719 Purchase obligations 107,564 104,099 3,013 448 4 Other long-term liabilities 16,325 977 15,348 — — Total $ 963,577 $ 137,818 $ 49,390 $ 768,599 $ 7,770 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the TCS acquisition (See Note 7 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.6%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2005 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2006, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 26",2023-12-30 21:46:41.403932
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2006 approximately 57% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2006. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs · Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure · Maintain a culture of controlling costs · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $2,471.4 million, $424.6 million and $255.7 million, respectively; up 37%, 24% and 24%, respectively, from 2005. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in the majority of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2006, the Company generated operating cash flow of $289.6 million. 16 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.1 66.9 67.6 Selling, general and administrative expense 13.9 14.2 14.3 Casualty loss related to flood .8 — — Operating income 17.2 18.9 18.1 Interest expense (1.6 ) (1.3 ) (1.5 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.4 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt — (.1 ) — Income before income taxes 15.1 17.0 16.2 Provision for income taxes (4.8 ) (5.6 ) (5.5 ) Net income 10.3 % 11.4 % 10.7 % 17 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales were $2,471.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,808.1 million for 2005, an increase of 37% in U.S. dollars and 36% in local currencies. The increase in sales over 2005 excluding acquisitions was 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 39% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currencies compared to 2005 ($2,207.5 million in 2006 versus $1,592.4 million in 2005). Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including telecommunications and data communications, mobile communications, industrial and military/aerospace markets. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets increased approximately $338.8 million reflecting the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 (Note 7) and increased sales of new high speed interconnect products for servers and other data center equipment applications. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $209.0 million) is attributable primarily to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products, the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 and to a lesser extent to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $55.8 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe relating to products for the factory automation, medical and oil/geophysical markets and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $15.4 million) relates to increased demand on commercial aircraft and military programs. Sales in the military/aerospace market were adversely impacted by approximately $25.0 million in 2006 due to business interruption related to the flood at the Company’s Sidney, New York facility further described below. Automotive sales declined approximately $8.1 million primarily as a result of a reduction in vehicle production rates by European and U.S. vehicle manufacturers. Sales of cable products (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 22% compared to 2005 ($263.9 million in 2006 versus $215.7 million in 2005). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2006 increased approximately 32% compared to 2005 ($1,060.0 million in 2006 versus $802.4 million in 2005); international sales for 2006 increased approximately 40% in U.S. dollars ($1,411.5 million in 2006 versus $1,005.8 million in 2005) and increased approximately 39% in local currency compared to 2005. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2006 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $16.5 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2005. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32% in 2006 compared to 33% in 2005 due primarily to a decrease in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment primarily as a result of the TCS acquisition (Note 7). The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. TCS margins are lower than the average margin of the Company and its inclusion in the consolidated results lowered the margin percentage. Interconnect segment margins excluding the impact of TCS were consistent with the prior year margins as the continuing development of new higher margin, application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control, offset increases resulting primarily from higher material costs. In addition, cable operating margins decreased 0.3% reflecting higher material and freight costs in 2006 driven by higher commodity and energy prices offset, in part, by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $342.8 million and $257.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, or approximately 14% of sales in each year. The increase in expense in 2006 is attributable to the impact of acquisitions and increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2006 and 2005. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased proportionately with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $34.2 million, due primarily to increases in costs as a result of the TCS acquisition and stock-based compensation expense of $9.7 million, as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” which was effective on January 1, 2006, in addition to general cost increases relating to professional fees, pensions and employee-related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.15 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. Interest expense was $38.8 million for 2006 compared to $24.1 million for 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels related to the TCS acquisition (Note 7). 18 Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. No such expenses were incurred in 2006. Other expenses, net, for 2006 and 2005 were $12.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($6.0 million in 2006 and $4.1 million in 2005), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.0 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2005), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2006 and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($2.1 million in 2006 and $1.5 million in 2005) primarily due to higher commitment fees offset by interest income ($0.7 million in 2006 and $0.4 million in 2005). See Note 11 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”. This pronouncement amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of SFAS No. 123”, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method and, in connection therewith compensation expense is recognized in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award. Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, and estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recorded stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. The Company estimated the fair value of stock option awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and disclosed the resulting estimated compensation effect on net income on a pro forma basis. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 the Company’s income before income taxes and net income was reduced by $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, or $.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 31.5% in 2006 and 33% in 2005. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2006 by approximately $5.6 million or $.06 per share. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net sales were $1,808.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,530.4 million for 2004 an increase of 18% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. The increase in sales over 2004 excluding acquisitions was 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 19% in U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to 2004 ($1,592.4 million in 2005 versus $1,333.8 million in 2004). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets and the impact of acquisitions. Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including mobile communications, military/aerospace, industrial, automotive, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $92.7 million) is attributable to increased demand for wireless infrastructure products for cell site installations in North America, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $24.1 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe and the impact of acquisitions. Automotive sales increased approximately $33.7 million primarily in Europe, reflecting the impact of an acquisition late 2004. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $57.8 million) relates to increased demand on military programs, avionics applications in North America and the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $45.8 million reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased sales in Asia for disk drive and storage applications. Sales of cable products increased 10% compared to 2004 ($215.7 million in 2005 versus $196.6 million in 2004). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2005 increased approximately 19% compared to 2004 ($802.4 million in 2005 versus $674.3 million in 2004); international sales for 2005 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,005.8 million in 2005 versus 19 $856.1 million in 2004) and increased approximately 17% in local currency compared to 2004. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2005 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $7.0 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2004. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 33% in 2005 compared to 32% in 2004. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was partially offset by a decline in margins in the cable segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. The decrease in cable margins was due to the impact of a continued increase in material costs which was not fully offset by price increases implemented during the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $257.1 million and $218.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, approximately 14.0% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $7.6 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2005 and 2004. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits. Interest expense was $24.1 million for 2005 compared to $22.5 million for 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially offset by the effect of the refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2005 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and higher average debt levels. Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. Other expenses, net, for 2005 and 2004 were $8.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) ($0.4 million in 2005 and $(0.6) million in 2004), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004, program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.8 million in 2005 and $2.3 million in 2004), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2005, minority interests ($4.1 million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2004) and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.5 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004) primarily due to higher commitment fees. See Note 10 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 33.0% in 2005 and 34% in 2004. The reduction in the tax rate in 2005 relates primarily to lower U.S. income taxes resulting from the impact of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 20 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $289.6 million, $229.6 million and $208.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating cash flow includes $nil, $5.0 million and $6.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, resulting from an increase in sale of receivables under the Company’s receivable securitization program. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a higher increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to the increase in 2005. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 is also primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to a decrease in 2004. The non-cash components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $19.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities. The non-cash components of working capital increased $36.7 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and $20.6 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. The non-cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in 2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory. In 2006, accounts receivable increased $81.0 million to $383.9 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $16.0 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 (“translation”) and $4.1 million from acquired companies. Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 66 days from 65 days in 2005. Inventory increased $90.6 million to $416.5 million, primarily due to an operating addition of $60.5 million, $13.3 million due to a new inventory hubbing arrangement with certain customers, $12.8 million due to translation and $4.0 million in inventory from acquired companies. Inventory days at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were 86 and 87, respectively. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets increased $34.8 million to $968.9 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year in addition to adjustments made for prior acquisitions. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $20.3 million to $274.1 million reflecting capital expenditures of $82.4 million, $9.8 million due to translation, assets from acquisitions of approximately $3.0 million offset by depreciation of $67.0 million and disposals of $8.0 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $57.6 million and $10.5 million to $234.9 million and $53.2 million, respectively, due to an increase in sales levels, liabilities assumed from acquired companies and a $7.4 million and $1.8 million increase, respectively, due to translation. Other accrued liabilities increased $55.5 million to $156.4 million relating primarily an increase of $21.6 million in liabilities associated with performance-based additional cash consideration on acquisitions, an increase in accrued income taxes of $17.9 million, the recording of $10.9 million in deferred revenue related to the new inventory hubbing arrangements discussed above, accruals relating to higher sales volume as well as a $4.1 million increase due to translation. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $29.5 million to $138.3 million primarily as a result of an increase of $21.1 million relating to the implementation of Statement No. 158 (“SFAS”) “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”, as further discussed below, and the impact of translation. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 158 whichrequires employers to fully recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet. The pension asset or liability under SFAS 158 is equal to the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and its projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. Prior guidance required the liability to be measured as the accumulated benefit obligation. In addition, this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end balance sheet, with limited exceptions. SFAS 158 also requires entities to disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The statement is effective for years ending after December 15, 2006 except for the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end balance sheet which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS 158 had the effect of increasing the Company’s accrued benefit obligation 21 (including the elimination of the intangible asset of $10.0 million at December 31, 2005) and other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax assets, by approximately $31.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively at December 31, 2006 and did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. In 2006, cash from operating activities of $289.6 million, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.9 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $31.9 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $82.4 million, acquisitions of $22.5 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, a net debt reduction of $102.6 million, purchases of treasury stock of $72.7 million, payment of fees and expenses related to refinancing of $1.1 million and an increase in cash on hand of $35.5 million. For 2005, cash from operating activities of $229.6 million (including additional sales of receivables of $5.0 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $36.4 million and net borrowings under the Company’s bank agreements of $331.1 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $57.1 million, payment of dividends of $8.0 million, acquisitions of $512.3 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $8.7 million, and an increase in cash on hand of $8.5 million. On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) was comprised of a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010, of which approximately $440 million was drawn at closing. The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company’s previous senior credit facility and for working capital purposes. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million. In December 2005, the TCS acquisition was funded with borrowings under the revolving credit facility. On August 1, 2006, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to reduce borrowing costs and increase the general indebtedness basket by $250 million through an accordion feature similar to that exercised on November 15, 2005. In addition, the term of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended from July 2010 to August 2011. At December 31, 2006, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $335.0 million, after a reduction of $12.3 million for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less tax effects of $0.8 million) or $.02 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 50 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s was Ba1. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.50X. At December 31, 2006, such ratios as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 11.53X and 1.47X, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $450.0 million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $6.6 million, $2.4 million and $nil were outstanding at December 31, 2006, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Company’s Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $429.1 million at December 31, 2006, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0 million, or approximately $607.8 million at December 31, 2006, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets. In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. The fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2006 would have resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.9 million; such gain, net of tax of $1.9 million, was recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a 22 decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2007 will be approximately $90.0 to $95.0 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company paid its fourth 2006 quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or $.03 per share on January 3, 2007 to shareholders of record as of December 13, 2006. Cumulative dividends declared during 2006 were $10.7 million of which $8.0 million were paid in 2006. Total dividends paid in 2006 were $10.7 million including those declared in 2005 and paid in 2006. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. On July 31, 2006, the Company terminated its then existing accounts receivable securitization facility and entered into a new Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “New Agreement”). The New Agreement allows the Company to sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable at costs that are lower than the previous agreement. The remaining terms and conditions of the New Agreement remained substantially the same as the previous facility. The New Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July 2009. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold under the previous agreement and the New Agreement, respectively, and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. TCS Acquisition On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) by and among Amphenol Corporation (the “Company”) and Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“Teradyne”), The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne’s backplane and connection systems business segment (“TCS”), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of approximately $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share. TCS results are reflected for the full year 2006. TCS is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $240.0 million of goodwill and $46.2 million of acquired intangible assets of which $30.7 million, $9.5 million and $6.0 million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 23 The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands except per share data) Net sales $ 2,146,286 $ 1,940,834 Operating income 347,301 304,451 Net income 195,675 166,746 Net income per common share - Basic $ 2.21 $ 1.89 Net income per common share - Diluted 2.16 1.86 To supplement the Company’s pro forma combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the Company’s pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current and expected financial performance and are “forward looking”. The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does not expect to recur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Company’s operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company’s ongoing combined operations. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) Benefit of reduction in employee related benefits (i) $ 1,969 $ 3,430 Benefit of reduction in Teradyne historical corporate allocations (ii) 7,505 8,000 Reversal of nonrecurring restructuring costs (iii) 11,654 4,148 Reversal of nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business (iv) (612 ) (865 ) Total $ 20,516 $ 14,713 (i) In conjunction with the acquisition, TCS’s historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCS’s historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred. (ii) Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition. (iii) Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings. 24 (iv) TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005 which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur in the future. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell) in December 1999), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Stock Split On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein has been restated to reflect the effect of such stock split. On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will be effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007 and these additional shares are expected to be distributed on or about March 30, 2007. The share information included herein does not reflect the effect of such stock split. Had this stock split occurred at December 31, 2006, total authorized shares of Common Stock would have been 400,000,000, total shares outstanding would have been 178,265,978 and net income per share on a diluted basis would have been $1.39. Recent Accounting Changes In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 157 but does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 25 On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and provides guidance on classification and disclosure requirements for tax contingencies. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2007. Although the Company is still in the process of determining the impact of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of its adoption. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“Plan”) covering their U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $17.0 million, $13.5 million and $10.1 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the Plan, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical seventeen-year compounded return of 11.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expectedlong-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8%. As of December 31, 2006, our asset allocation was 69% with equity managers and 31% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2006 and 2005. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has increased from 5.50% at December 31, 2005 to 5.75% at December 31, 2006. This will have the effect of decreasing pension expense in 2007 by approximately $.6 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $13.8 million or increased $15.2 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the Plan which will result in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who have less than 25 years service with the Company, or who have not attained age 50 and who have less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing the unfunded pension liability by $5.1 million at December 31, 2006 and will have the effect of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company expects to contribute approximately $1.8 million in 2007. The Company made cash contributions to the Plan of $15 million and $10 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under the Plan increased in 2006 to $138.3 million from $108.8 million in 2005, primarily due to the implementation of SFAS 158 (See Liquidity and Capital Resources section) which resulted in an increase of approximately $21.1 million and the foreign currency translation effect of non-U.S. pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the Plan in 2007 of approximately $15.0 to $20.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The intent of the legislation is to require companies to fund 100% of their pension liability; and then for companies to fund, on a going-forward basis, an amount generally estimated to be the amount that the pension liability increases each year due to an additional year of service by the employees eligible for pension benefits. The legislation requires that funding shortfalls be eliminated by companies over a seven-year period, beginning in 2008. The Pension Protection Act also extended the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act that would have expired in 2006 had the Pension Protection Act not been enacted, which increased the allowed discount rate used to calculate the pension liability. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning after 2007 and the Company is in the process of determining the impact of this legislation. 26 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 11% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation – The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2006, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt $ 673,778 $ 262 $ 1,512 $ 671,232 $ 772 Capital lease obligations 6,636 2,979 3,657 — — Operating leases 56,553 18,101 21,696 10,476 6,280 Purchase obligations 158,677 155,784 2,857 36 — Other liabilities (1) 29,860 22,147 7,713 — — Total $ 925,504 $ 199,273 $ 37,435 $ 681,744 $ 7,052 (1) Other liabilities consist of obligations related to acquisitions for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration. 27 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the December 2005 TCS acquisition (Note 7), the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.61%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2006 would not have materially increased or decreased interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2007, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 28",2023-12-30 21:46:48.331194
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2007, approximately 59% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2007. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs · Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure · Maintain a culture of controlling costs · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $2,851.0 million, $552.9 million and $353.2 million, respectively; up 15%, 30% and 38%, respectively, from 2006. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in all of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2007, the Company generated operating cash flow of $387.9 million. 17 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.4 68.1 66.9 Selling, general and administrative expense 13.2 13.9 14.2 Casualty loss related to flood — .8 — Operating income 19.4 17.2 18.9 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.6 ) (1.3 ) Other expenses, net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt — — (.1 ) Income before income taxes 17.6 15.1 17.0 Provision for income taxes (5.2 ) (4.8 ) (5.6 ) Net income 12.4 % 10.3 % 11.4 % 18 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales were $2,851.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2,471.4 million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. The increase in sales over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2006 ($2,569.3 million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in 2006). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications, industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for data centers. Sales of cable products (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8 million in 2007 versus $263.9 million in 2006). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007 increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus $1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately 20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5 million in 2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. In addition, cable operating margins increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price increases partially offset by higher material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, and cost increases relating to professional fees as well as salaries and employee-related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007 compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower average debt levels in 2007. Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were $15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007 and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006). 19 The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net sales were $2,471.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,808.1 million for 2005, an increase of 37% in U.S. dollars and 36% in local currencies. The increase in sales over 2005 excluding acquisitions was 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 39% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currencies compared to 2005 ($2,207.5 million in 2006 versus $1,592.4 million in 2005). Sales increased in the Company’s major end markets including telecommunications and data communications, mobile communications, industrial and military/aerospace markets. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets increased approximately $338.8 million reflecting the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 (Note 8) and increased sales of new high speed interconnect products for servers and other data center equipment applications. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $209.0 million) is attributable primarily to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products, the impact of the acquisition of TCS in December 2005 and to a lesser extent to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $55.8 million) reflects increased sales in North America and Europe relating to products for the factory automation, medical and oil/geophysical markets and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $15.4 million) relates to increased demand on commercial aircraft and military programs. Sales in the military/aerospace market were adversely impacted by approximately $25.0 million in 2006 due to business interruption related to the flood at the Company’s Sidney, New York facility further described below. Automotive sales declined approximately $8.1 million primarily as a result of a reduction in vehicle production rates by European and U.S. vehicle manufacturers. Sales of cable products (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 22% compared to 2005 ($263.9 million in 2006 versus $215.7 million in 2005). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2006 increased approximately 32% compared to 2005 ($1,060.0 million in 2006 versus $802.4 million in 2005); international sales for 2006 increased approximately 40% in U.S. dollars ($1,411.5 million in 2006 versus $1,005.8 million in 2005) and increased approximately 39% in local currency compared to 2005. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2006 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $16.5 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2005. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32% in 2006 compared to 33% in 2005 due primarily to a decrease in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment primarily as a result of the TCS acquisition (Note 8). The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year. TCS margins are lower than the average margin of the Company and its inclusion in the consolidated results lowered the margin percentage. Interconnect segment margins excluding the impact of TCS were consistent with the prior year margins as the continuing development of new higher margin, application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control, offset increases resulting primarily from higher material costs. In addition, cable operating margins decreased 0.3% reflecting higher material and freight costs in 2006 driven by higher commodity and energy prices offset, in part, by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $342.8 million and $257.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, or approximately 14% of sales in each year. The increase in expense in 2006 is attributable to the impact of acquisitions and increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2006 and 2005. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $34.2 million, due primarily to increases in costs as a result of the TCS acquisition and stock-based compensation expense of $9.7 million, as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” which was effective on January 1, 2006, in addition to general cost increases relating to professional fees, pensions and employee-related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. 20 Interest expense was $38.8 million for 2006 compared to $24.1 million for 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels related to the TCS acquisition (Note 8). Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7 million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of $3.2 million. No such expenses were incurred in 2006. Other expenses, net, for 2006 and 2005 were $12.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($6.0 million in 2006 and $4.1 million in 2005), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.0 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2005), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2006 and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($2.1 million in 2006 and $1.5 million in 2005) primarily due to higher commitment fees offset by interest income ($0.7 million in 2006 and $0.4 million in 2005). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”. This pronouncement amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of SFAS No. 123”, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method and, in connection therewith compensation expense is recognized in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award. Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, and estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recorded stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. The Company estimated the fair value of stock option awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and disclosed the resulting estimated compensation effect on net income on a pro forma basis. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 the Company’s income before income taxes and net income was reduced by $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, or $.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 31.5% in 2006 and 33% in 2005. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2006 by approximately $5.6 million or $.03 per share. 21 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $387.9 million, $289.6 million and $229.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is also primarily attributable to an increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a higher increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to the increase in 2005. The non-cash components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The non-cash components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities. The non-cash components of working capital increased $36.7 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and $20.6 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. In 2007, accounts receivable increased $126.6 million to $510.4 million, due to an increase in sales levels, $16.4 million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 (“Translation”) and the remaining increase due to acquired companies. Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 69 days from 66 days in 2006 with Translation accounting for 1 day of the increase. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $12.8 million to $72.9 million primarily from higher value-added tax receivables related to foreign operations in addition to higher short-term investment balances. Inventory increased $40.4 million to $456.9 million, primarily resulting from increased sales activity of $22.7 million as well as increases related to Translation and inventory from acquired companies of $11.5 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 80 and 86, respectively. Other long-term assets decreased $16.5 million to $43.9 million primarily due to a reduction in long-term deferred tax assets and a reduction of the fair value of interest rate swaps arrangements in addition to amortization of intangible assets. Goodwill increased $165.6 million to $1,091.8 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and recording of liabilities for performance-based additional cash consideration of $24.6 million in addition to adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $42.1 million to $316.2 million reflecting capital expenditures of $103.8 million, $10.1 million due to Translation as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $8.8 million offset by depreciation of $76.0 million and disposals of $4.6 million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $60.5 million and $1.8 million to $295.4 million and $55.0 million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels as well as liabilities assumed from acquired companies and a $7.3 and $0.5 million increase, respectively, due to Translation. Other accrued liabilities increased $12.7 million to $169.1 million relating primarily to an increase of $32.6 million in liabilities associated with performance-based additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase of $6.8 million due to Translation offset by a decrease in accrued income taxes of $23.4 million due primarily to the reclassification of the long term portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 to long-term liabilities of $28.8 million. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations decreased $36.5 million to $101.8 million primarily due to contributions made during 2007 and higher discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 offset by an increase of $5.6 million due to Translation. Other long-term liabilities increased $37.7 million to $67 million due primarily to the reclassification of the long-term portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 from other accrued expenses as discussed above in addition to higher long-term deferred tax liabilities partially offset by a reduction in minority interest liabilities of $14.4 million due to the purchase of the remaining 30% of one of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. In 2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3 million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, purchases of short-term investments of $1.4 million and an increase in cash on hand of $109.5 million. For 22 2006, cash from operating activities of $289.6 million, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.9 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $31.9 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $82.4 million, acquisitions of $22.5 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, a net debt reduction of $102.6 million, purchases of treasury stock of $72.7 million, payment of fees and expenses related to refinancing of $1.1 million and an increase in cash on hand of $35.5 million. On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) was comprised of a five-year $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010, of which approximately $440.0 million was drawn at closing. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250.0 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1,000.0 million. On August 1, 2006, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to reduce borrowing costs and increase the general indebtedness basket by $250.0 million through an accordion feature similar to that exercised on November 15, 2005. In addition, the term of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended from July 2010 to August 2011. At December 31, 2007, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $274.6 million, after a reduction of $13.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less tax effects of $0.8 million), or $.01 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s was Baa3. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.25X; at December 31, 2007, such ratios as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 15.46X and 1.21X, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $450.0 million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $3.3 million, $1.1 million and $nil were outstanding at December 31, 2007, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Company’s Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $605.7 million at December 31, 2007, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0 million, or approximately $784.4 million at December 31, 2007, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets. In conjunction with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million, $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.24%, 4.85% and 4.40%, expiring in July 2008, December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. In October 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73% and 4.65% which go into effect in July 2008 and December 2008 and expire in July 2010 and December 2009, respectively. The fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of all swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2007 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $11.4 million; such loss, net of tax of $4.4 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $183.6 million and $74.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the majority of which was in non-U.S. accounts as of December 31, 2007. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. 23 The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2008 will be approximately $95.0 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.015 per share. The Company paid its fourth 2007 quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or $.015 per share on January 2, 2008 to shareholders of record as of December 12, 2007. Cumulative dividends declared during 2007 were $10.7 million. Total dividends paid in 2007 were $10.7 million including those declared in 2006 and paid in 2007. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. On July 31, 2006, the Company terminated its then existing accounts receivable securitization facility and entered into a new Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “New Agreement”). The New Agreement allows the Company to sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable at costs that are lower than the previous agreement. The remaining terms and conditions of the New Agreement remained substantially the same as the previous facility. The New Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July 2009. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. TCS Acquisition On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) by and among Amphenol Corporation (the “Company”) and Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“Teradyne”), The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne’s backplane and connection systems business segment (“TCS”), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of approximately $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share. TCS results are reflected for the full year 2006 and 2007. TCS is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $240.0 million of goodwill and $46.2 million of acquired intangible assets of which $30.7 million, $9.5 million and $6.0 million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position 24 or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands except per share data) Net sales $ 2,146,286 Operating income 347,301 Net income 195,675 Net income per common share - Basic $ 1.10 Net income per common share - Diluted 1.08 To supplement the Company’s pro forma combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the Company’s pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current and expected financial performance and are “forward looking”. The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does not expect to recur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Company’s operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company’s ongoing combined operations. For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands) Benefit of reduction in employee related benefits (i) $ 1,969 Benefit of reduction in Teradyne historical corporate allocations (ii) 7,505 Reversal of nonrecurring restructuring costs (iii) 11,654 Reversal of nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business (iv) (612 ) Total $ 20,516 (i) In conjunction with the acquisition, TCS’s historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCS’s historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred. (ii) Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition. (iii) Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses which in included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings. (iv) TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2005 which is included in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur in the future. 25 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007 and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, as a result of FASB Staff Position 157-2 issued in February 2008, and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2009. The Company does not believe SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe SFAS 159 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 26 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: 1.) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, 2.) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3.) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to this Statement are (1) that the Statement requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred (2) that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill, and (3) any liabilities related to noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have, but believes the impact will not be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. This Statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to this Statement are (1) the Statement requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interest’s share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interest’s share in net income of the Company as is current practice.) During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of $10.5 million, $6.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2) this Statement requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $14.8 million and $18.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have, but believes the primary impact will be as described above. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”) covering their U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $16.0 million, $17.0 million and $13.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical eighteen-year compounded return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 10.65%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8%. As of December 31, 2007, the asset allocation was 62% with equity managers and 31% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 7% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2007 and 2006 is 9.25% and 9.5%, respectively. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis has increased from 5.75% at December 31, 2006 to 6.25% at December 31, 2007. This will have the effect of decreasing pension expense in 2008 by approximately $2.2 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased $14.4 million or increased $15.0 million, respectively. 27 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing the unfunded pension liability by $5.1 million at December 31, 2006 and had the effect of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.7 million in 2007. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 158 which requires employers to fully recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet. The pension asset or liability under SFAS 158 is equal to the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and its projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. Prior guidance required the liability to be measured as the accumulated benefit obligation. In addition, this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end balance sheet, with limited exceptions. SFAS 158 also requires entities to disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The statement was effective for years ending after December 15, 2006 except for the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end balance sheet which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS 158 had the effect of increasing the Company’s accrued benefit obligation and other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax assets, by approximately $31.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively at December 31, 2006 and did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million and $15 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the “Plans”) decreased in 2007 to $101.8 million from $138.3 million in 2006 primarily due to the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2007 as well as the higher discount rate assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 offset by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2008 of approximately $10.0 to $20.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The intent of the legislation is to require companies to fund 100% of their pension liability; and then for companies to fund, on a going-forward basis, an amount generally estimated to be the amount that the pension liability increases each year due to an additional year of service by the employees eligible for pension benefits. The legislation requires that funding shortfalls be eliminated by companies over a seven-year period, beginning in 2008. The Pension Protection Act also extended the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act that would have expired in 2006 had the Pension Protection Act not been enacted, which increased the allowed discount rate used to calculate the pension liability. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning after 2007 and the Company does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. 28 Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation — The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2007, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 719,297 $ 489 $ 999 $ 717,730 $ 79 Capital lease obligations 3,339 586 1,632 618 503 Operating leases 70,427 20,691 28,390 13,995 7,351 Purchase obligations 153,928 151,359 1,600 969 — Accrued acquisition-related obligations (2) 55,212 55,212 — — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 40,582 3,832 7,982 8,361 20,407 Total (4) $ 1,042,785 $ 232,169 $ 40,603 $ 741,673 $ 28,340 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2007 were $36,238. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the U.S. Plan in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2008. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns. (4) As of December 31, 2007, the Company has FIN 48 liabilities of $33,037. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non-current FIN 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non-current liabilities might be paid. 29 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million, $250.0 million and $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.24%, 4.85% and 4.40%, expiring in July 2008, December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.56%. In October 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73% and 4.65% which go into effect in July 2008 and December 2008 and expire in July 2010 and December 2009, respectively. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2007 would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2008, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 30",2023-12-30 21:46:51.599852
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2008, approximately 64% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2008. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs · Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure · Maintain a culture of controlling costs · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5 million, $632.2 million and $419.2 million, respectively; up 14%, 14% and 19%, respectively, from 2007. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in predominantly all of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2008, the Company generated operating cash flow of $481.5 million. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.6 67.4 68.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 12.9 13.2 13.9 Casualty loss related to flood — — .8 Operating income 19.5 19.4 17.2 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.3 ) (1.6 ) Other expenses, net (.3 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Income before income taxes 18.0 17.6 15.1 Provision for income taxes (5.0 ) (5.2 ) (4.8 ) Net income 13.0 % 12.4 % 10.3 % 17 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales were $3,236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2,851.0 million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91% of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($2,950.6 million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in 2007). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs, including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railway/mass transit markets. The automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007). Such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in 2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars ($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2 million in 2007) and increased approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. Cable operating margins decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately 13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately $16.1 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employee-related benefits. Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008 compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008. Other expenses, net for 2008 and 2007 were $10.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.4 million in 2008 and $10.5 million in 2007), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.1 million in 2008 and $5.2 million in 2007), and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.8 million in both 2008 and 2007) offset by interest income ($4.7 million in 2008 and $2.7 million in 2007). The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 28.0% in 2008 and 29.5% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.7 million or $.04 per share. 18 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales were $2,851.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2,471.4 million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2007 over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2007 (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2006 ($2,569.3 million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in 2006). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications, industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for data centers. Sales of cable products in 2007 (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8 million in 2007 versus $263.9 million in 2006). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007 increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus $1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately 20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5 million in 2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. In addition, cable operating margins increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price increases partially offset by higher material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, and cost increases relating to professional fees as well as salaries and employee-related benefits. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million. Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007 compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower average debt levels in 2007. Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were $15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007 and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006). 19 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $481.5 million, $387.9 million and $289.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities. In 2008, accounts receivable increased $5.6 million to $516.0 million, due primarily to acquisitions during the period, partially offset by translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 72 days from 69 days in 2007. Inventory increased $55.6 million to $512.5 million, resulting from higher activity levels in 2008, an increase in inventory days, and inventory from acquired companies of $19.3 million, partially offset by $9.7 million of Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 88 and 80, respectively. The increase in inventory days resulted primarily from a slowdown in sales activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the well publicized global economic slowdown. The Company will continue to focus on inventory reduction as adjustments to production activity continue in response to lower demand levels. Other current assets increased $19.5 million to $92.4 million primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $28.3 million to $344.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $108.5 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $9.5 million offset by depreciation of $80.7 million, $7.5 million due to Translation and disposals of $1.5 million. Goodwill increased $140.5 million to $1,232.3 million primarily as a result of three acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and recording of liabilities for performance-based additional cash consideration of $131.7 million offset by adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions, and by Translation of $25.2 million and $14.1 million in intangible assets reclassified to other long-term assets representing the fair value assigned to identifiable assets associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2007. Other long-term assets increased $37.5 million to $81.4 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2008 acquisitions as well as the reclassification from goodwill discussed above related to 2007 acquisitions and an increase in long-term deferred tax assets primarily associated with the increase in the accrued pension and post-employment obligation, offset by amortization of the intangible asset balances. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $10.6 million and $4.7 million to $306.0 million and $59.6 million, respectively, due primarily to liabilities assumed from acquired companies offset by Translation. The other accrued liabilities including acquisition-related obligations and accrued income taxes increased $99.7 million to $268.8 million relating primarily to an increase of $65.1 million in liabilities associated with performance-based additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase in accrued income taxes of $26.2 million due primarily to an increase in liabilities related to foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $59.9 million to $161.7 million primarily due to a decrease in plan assets during the year resulting from equity market losses in 2008. Other long-term liabilities decreased $4.8 million to $62.2 million due primarily to lower long-term deferred tax liabilities offset by a higher minority interest liability at December 31, 2008. 20 Table of Contents In 2008, cash from operating activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $108.3 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short-term investments of $2.9 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $31.3 million. For 2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3 million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, purchases of short-term investments of $1.4 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $109.5 million. The Company’s senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five-year $1,000.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August 2011, of which $778.0 million was drawn at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207.2 million, after a reduction of $14.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s was Baa3. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010, respectively. The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2008 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $25.0 million; such loss, net of tax of $9.2 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $215.0 million and $183.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the majority of which was in non-U.S. accounts as of December 31, 2008. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2009 will be approximately $85 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared during 2008 were $10.5 million. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10.6 million, including those declared in 2007 and paid in 2008. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings not used for dividend payments to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s business, to repurchase shares of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Agreement”). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July 2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 Table of Contents Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007, and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141R, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1) that SFAS 141R requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2) that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill; and (3) any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The 22 Table of Contents presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 160 are: (1) SFAS 160 requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests’ share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company as is the current practice). During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests’ share in income of $10.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2) SFAS 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $19.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities. The Company believes the primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be as described above. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet those objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly impact its disclosure requirements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”) covering certain of its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $12.0 million, $16.0 million and $17.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical nineteen-year compounded return of 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 9%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.8% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 6%. As of December 31, 2008, the asset allocation was 45% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 18% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively. This reduction in the long-term rate of return will have the effect of increasing 2009 pension expense by approximately $2.4 million. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis was 6.25% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $15.5 million. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.9 million and $1.7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million in both 2008 and 2007. The liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under all the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the “Plans”) increased in 2008 to $165.9 million ($4.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be 23 Table of Contents made during 2009 for foreign plans) from $101.8 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in plan assets in the U.S. Plan offset by the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2009 of approximately $15 million to $20 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation – The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2008, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 784,601 $ 121 $ 778,951 $ 5,480 $ 49 Capital lease obligations 1,858 318 872 359 309 Operating leases 76,971 20,945 30,395 17,367 8,264 Purchase obligations 139,634 135,823 2,932 879 — Accrued acquisition-related obligations (2) 120,357 120,357 — — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 37,537 4,220 8,773 9,452 15,092 Total (4) $ 1,160,958 $ 281,784 $ 821,923 $ 33,537 $ 23,714 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2008 were $39,180. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2009. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns. (4) As of December 31, 2008, the Company has FASB Interpretation No. 48 liabilities of $38,058. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non-current FIN 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non-current liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010. At December 31, 2008, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.09%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 25 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:48.521085
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2009, approximately 64% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2009. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs · Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure · Maintain a culture of controlling costs · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $2,820.1 million, $488.9 million and $317.8 million, respectively; down 13%, 23% and 24%, respectively, from 2008. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products decreased in all of the Company’s major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2009, the Company generated operating cash flow of $582.3 million. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.6 67.6 67.4 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.1 12.9 13.2 Operating income 17.3 19.5 19.4 Interest expense (1.3 ) (1.2 ) (1.3 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps (0.2 ) — — Other expenses, net — — (0.2 ) Income before income taxes 15.8 18.3 17.9 Provision for income taxes (4.2 ) (5.0 ) (5.2 ) Net income 11.6 13.3 12.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 11.3 % 13.0 % 12.4 % 16 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales were $2,820.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008, a decrease of 13% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currencies and 16% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 (approximately 91% of net sales) decreased 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($2,566.6 million in 2009 versus $2,950.6 million in 2008). Sales decreased in the Company’s major end markets, including the industrial, telecommunications and data communications, automotive, wireless communications and military/aerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn. The industrial market sales decreased (approximately $113.9 million) reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation, natural resource exploration, heavy equipment and railway/mass transit. The telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased (approximately $164.8 million) primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand. Sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $42.3 million) primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. The wireless communications market sales decreased (approximately $46.1 million) in primarily all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base station/equipment manufacturers, partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the military/aerospace markets decreased (approximately $20.8 million), primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products in 2009 (approximately 9% of net sales) decreased 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($253.5 million in 2009 versus $285.9 million in 2008). This decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2009 decreased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,001.7 million in 2009 versus $1,159.3 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 13% in local currencies. International sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,818.3 million in 2009 versus $2,077.2 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 11% in local currencies compared to 2008. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $38.2 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.4% in 2009 compared to 32.4% in 2008. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment, partially offset by effective cost control programs. Cable operating margins increased 3.9% primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $397.6 million and $416.9 million in 2009 and 2008, or approximately 14% and 13% of net sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions. Selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately $12.9 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs. Research and development expenditures decreased approximately $4.1 million. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.3 million and represented approximately 5.0% and 4.5% of sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense was $36.6 million for 2009 compared to $39.6 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels. The Company incurred a $4.6 million charge (or $.02 per share) for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009. Refer to” Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.7% in 2009 and 27.5% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions. 17 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales were $3,236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2,851.0 million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91% of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($2,950.6 million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in 2007). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs, including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railway/mass transit markets. The automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007). Such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in 2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars ($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2 million in 2007) and increased approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. Cable operating margins decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately 13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately $16.1 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employee-related benefits. Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008 compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008. Other expenses, net for 2008 were not significant. Other expenses, net for 2007 were $4.5 million and are comprised primarily of program fees on the sale of accounts receivable of $5.2 million, and agency and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities of $1.8 million offset by interest income of $2.7 million. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 27.5% in 2008 and 28.9% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.3 million, or an additional $.04 per share. 18 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $582.3 million, $481.5 million and $387.9 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, $16.1 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Company’s receivable securitization program and a $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009. Accounts receivable decreased $66.4 million to $449.6 million, primarily reflecting the impact of lower sales levels and a reduction in days sales outstanding, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of $18.8 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding decreased to approximately 64 days from 72 days in 2008. Inventory decreased $50.8 million to $461.8 million, primarily due to adjustments to production activity in response to lower demand levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of $20.1 million and Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 80 and 88, respectively. Other current assets increased $32.1 million to $124.4 million primarily due to higher short-term investments purchases during 2009. Land and depreciable assets, net, decreased $11.6 million to $332.9 million reflecting capital expenditures of $63.1 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $10.0 million and Translation of $5.9 million offset by depreciation of $85.1 million and disposals of $5.5 million. Goodwill increased $136.3 million to $1,368.7 million primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long-term assets increased $15.8 million to $97.2 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2009 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in long-term deferred tax assets of $9.5 million. Accounts payable decreased $13.8 million to $292.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in purchasing activity during the year related to lower sales levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of $10.7 and Translation. Total accrued liabilities decreased $117.8 million, primarily as a result of payments and adjustments made related to accrued acquisition-related obligations of $113.1 million as well as a decrease in accrued foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $10.6 million to $172.2 million due primarily to a higher projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption offset by an increase in plan assets during the year. Other long-term liabilities decreased $15.2 million to $27.9 million due to the reclassification of the fair value of short-term interest rate swaps to other accrued expenses in 2009. In 2009, cash from operating activities of $582.3 million, proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $598.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $3.2 million were used to fund $280.0 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $63.1 million, purchases of short-term investments of $33.3 million, payments to noncontrolling interests of $23.3 million, dividend payments of $10.3 million, net repayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign debt of $631.9 million, costs related to the issuance of Senior Notes and the early extinguishment of interest rate swap agreements of $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $169.6 million. In 2008, cash from operating activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, 19 Table of Contents capital expenditures of $108.3 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short-term investments of $2.9 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $31.3 million. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due in November, 2014 at a discount of 99.813% ($1.1 million unamortized at December 31, 2009). Net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Company incurred fees and expenses related to the Senior Notes of $4.7 million, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2010. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. In conjunction with the note issuance, the Company’s existing five-year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in August 2011, was amended to reduce the commitment from $1,000.0 million to $752.0 million. At December 31, 2009, borrowings and availability under the facility were $150.0 million and $602.0 million, respectively. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s was Baa3. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150.0 million that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate at 4.73%, expiring in July 2010. The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $3.7 million; such loss, net of tax of $1.4 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. In conjunction with the repayment of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from the net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes, certain interest rate swap agreements were terminated and a one-time charge of $4.6 million (or $.02 per share) was incurred related to the cost of such termination. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2010 will be approximately $80.0 to $100.0 million. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2009 were $10.3 million, including those declared in 2008 and paid in 2009. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $422.4 million December 31, 2009, the majority of which was in non-U.S. accounts. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Accounts Receivable Agreement”). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Accounts Receivable Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and was originally set to expire in July 2009. The Accounts Receivable Agreement was amended in May 2009 to extend the term of the agreement to May 2010. Upon expiration of the term, the Company intends to replace the Accounts Receivable Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $82.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable or debt balances in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2010, with the adoption of recent amendments to the Transfers and Servicing and 20 Table of Contents Consolidation Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), the Company will report receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Agreement, that as of December 31, 2009 were reported off-balance sheet, as accounts receivable and short-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to “Recent Accounting Changes.” Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition in 1987, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse the Company 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Stock Split On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007, and these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split. Recent Accounting Changes In June 2009, FASB issued Statement No. 168, “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” which is a significant restructuring of accounting and reporting standards designed to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles by providing the authoritative literature in a topically organized structure. The Company has adopted the ASC, which became effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted amended standards set forth in the Consolidation Topic of the ASC. These standards require companies to classify expenses related to noncontrolling interests’ share in income below net income (earnings per share continues to be determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company). In addition, these standards require the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within equity. The presentation and disclosure requirements of these standards were retroactively applied in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In connection with the adoption of these standards, the Company also changed the presentation of certain information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow within operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 21 Table of Contents The Subsequent Events Topic of the ASC provides general standards of accounting for, and disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, these standards set forth: (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and (3) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. Certain standards within the Subsequent Events Topic regarding disclosure became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted such standards, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the accompanying financial statements were issued, which was February 23, 2010. In June 2009, the Transfers and Servicing Topic and the Consolidation Topic of the ASC were amended specifically in terms of transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities. These standards apply prospectively to financial asset transfers occurring in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 to variable interest entities existing on or after November 15, 2009. The objective of the amendment to the Transfers and Servicing Topic of the ASC is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position; financial performance and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This amendment eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities (“QSPEs”). As a result, a transferor must evaluate existing QSPEs to determine whether they must be consolidated in the reporting entity’s financial statements. The objective of the amendment to the Consolidation Topic of the ASC is to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The Company evaluated the amendments discussed above, and as a result, the Company will report receivables sold under its receivable securitization agreement that are currently reported off-balance sheet as accounts receivable and short-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets effective January 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, approximately $82.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, of receivables were sold and are not reflected in accounts receivable or debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fees associated with the Accounts Receivable Agreement, which are currently included in other expenses, net will be included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s credit ratios and ratings have always treated receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Agreement as debt and therefore these ratios and ratings will be unaffected by the adoption of the amendment to this Topic. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”) covering certain of its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for pension plans approximated $16.5 million, $12.2 million and $16.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 10%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 9.5% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 7.0%. As of December 31, 2009, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 38% with fixed income managers and 3% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately 8.25%. 22 Table of Contents The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis was 5.75% at December 31, 2009 and 6.25% at December 31, 2008. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $16.2 million. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $2.0 million and $1.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of nil and $20.0 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The U.S. Plan made benefit payments of $16.1 million and $16.5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under all the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the “Plans”) increased in 2009 to $176.5 million ($4.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2010 for foreign plans) from $165.9 million in 2008 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2008 offset by an increase in plan assets in the U.S. Plan. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it may make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2010 of approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not had any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units in accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles — Goodwill and Other as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June 30, 2009, and for 23 Table of Contents each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair market value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation — The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2009, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 752,010 $ — $ 150,667 $ 601,126 $ 217 Interest related to Senior Notes 143,292 29,292 57,000 57,000 — Capital lease obligations 1,439 399 548 492 — Operating leases 73,803 22,254 29,723 16,062 5,764 Purchase obligations 120,277 117,442 2,835 — — Accrued acquisition-related obligations (2) 7,244 7,244 — — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 40,313 4,220 8,731 9,398 17,964 Total (4) $ 1,138,378 $ 180,851 $ 249,504 $ 684,078 $ 23,945 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2009 were $38,532. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, so the Company did not make any such contributions in 2009. The Company may make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in 2010. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As of December 31, 2009, the Company has liabilities of $40,208 recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non-current liabilities, it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non-current liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes. 24 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2009, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.73%, expiring in July 2010. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.73%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2009 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2010, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes at a discount of 99.813% due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. 25 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:43.165806
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2010, approximately 65% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 6% of net sales in 2010. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs; · Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities; · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure; · Maintain a culture of controlling costs; and · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $3,554.1 million, $700.4 million and $496.4 million, respectively; up 26%, 43% and 56%, respectively, from 2009. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in all of the Company’s major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2010, the Company generated operating cash flow of $506.9 million, before a reduction of $82.0 million from the January 1, 2010 adoption of the FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (“ASU 2009-16”)(refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein). 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.4 68.6 67.6 Selling, general and administrative expense 12.9 14.1 12.9 Operating income 19.7 17.3 19.5 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.5 ) (1.2 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps — (0.2 ) — Other income (expense), net 0.1 — — Income before income taxes 18.6 15.8 18.3 Provision for income taxes (4.5 ) (4.2 ) (5.0 ) Net income 14.1 11.6 13.3 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 14.0 % 11.3 % 13.0 % 17 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Net sales were $3,554.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2,820.1 million for 2009, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 22% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2010 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 28% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currencies compared to 2009 ($3,293.1 million in 2010 versus $2,566.6 million in 2009). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets, including the telecommunications and data communications, wireless communications, industrial, military/aerospace and automotive markets as a result of a broad strengthening from a product, customer and geographic perspective and to a lesser extent from acquisitions. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications market increased (approximately $202.7 million) primarily due to increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment. The wireless communications market sales increased (approximately $181.3 million) in all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to higher handset and tablet computer demand and in the wireless infrastructure market due to higher cell site installation demand, which also drove higher demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $163.9 million) primarily reflecting increased sales to the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased (approximately $125.2 million), primarily due to higher demand in the defense market and to a lesser extent the commercial market. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $42.8 million) primarily due to the increased demand in the European and U.S. automotive markets including the ramp up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sales of cable products in 2010 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 3% in U.S. dollars and were relatively flat in local currencies compared to 2009 ($261.0 million in 2010 versus $253.5 million in 2009), primarily attributed to an increase in spending in international broadband markets, partially offset by lower spending in North American broadband markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($1,258.2 million in 2010 versus $1,001.7 million in 2009) compared to 2009. International sales for 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($2,296.0 million in 2010 versus $1,818.3 million in 2009) compared to 2009. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2010 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $1.1 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2009. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.6% in 2010 compared to 31.4% in 2009. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs. Cable operating margins decreased 1.7% primarily as a result of higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $457.9 million and $397.6 million in 2010 and 2009, or approximately 13% and 14% of net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $17.1 million in 2010 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Administrative expenses increased approximately $29.6 million, primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, amortization of identified intangible assets and employee incentive payments, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Interest expense was $40.7 million for 2010 compared to $36.6 million for 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of fees of $1.5 million in 2010 on the Company’s Receivables Securitization Facility in interest expense (included in other expense, net in 2009) in accordance with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (“ASU 2009-16”), which was effective January 1, 2010 (Note 3) and is also attributable to one-time expenses of $0.5 million for the early extinguishment of the Company’s previous credit facility (Note 3) and a full year of deferred debt issue costs in the 2010 related to the Senior Notes issuance in November 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.3% in 2010 and 26.7% in 2009. The 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $20.7 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. The 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these adjustments, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 27.4% and 27.5%, respectively. The Company is present in over fifty taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 18 Table of Contents 2007 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $23.3 million, the majority of which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $4.8 million. 19 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 Net sales were $2,820.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008, a decrease of 13% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currencies and 16% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 (approximately 91% of net sales) decreased 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($2,566.6 million in 2009 versus $2,950.6 million in 2008). Sales decreased in the Company’s major end markets, including the industrial, telecommunications and data communications, automotive, wireless communications and military/aerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn. The industrial market sales decreased (approximately $113.9 million) reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation, natural resource exploration, heavy equipment and railway/mass transit. The telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased (approximately $164.8 million) primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand. Sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $42.3 million) primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. The wireless communications market sales decreased (approximately $46.1 million) in primarily all areas, including the mobile device market, primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base station/equipment manufacturers, partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the military/aerospace markets decreased (approximately $20.8 million), primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products in 2009 (approximately 9% of net sales) decreased 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to 2008 ($253.5 million in 2009 versus $285.9 million in 2008). This decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2009 decreased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,001.7 million in 2009 versus $1,159.3 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 13% in local currencies. International sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,818.3 million in 2009 versus $2,077.2 million in 2008) and decreased approximately 11% in local currencies compared to 2008. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $38.2 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.4% in 2009 compared to 32.4% in 2008. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment, partially offset by effective cost control programs. Cable operating margins increased 3.9% primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $397.6 million and $416.9 million in 2009 and 2008, or approximately 14% and 13% of net sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions. Selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately $12.9 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs. Research and development expenditures decreased approximately $4.1 million. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.3 million and represented approximately 5.0% and 4.5% of sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense was $36.6 million for 2009 compared to $39.6 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels. The Company incurred a $4.6 million charge (or $.02 per share) for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.7% in 2009 and 27.5% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions and includes a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $424.9 million for 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities was reduced by $82.0 million related to the effect of adoption of ASU 2009-16 (refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash flow provided by operating activities excluding the effect of adoption of ASU 2009-16 was $506.9 million compared to $582.3 million and $481.5 million 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the effect of adoption, the decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to an increase in the components of working capital compared to decreases in these components in 2009 offset by an increase in net income and an increase in non-cash expenses, including depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $120.1million in 2010 due primarily to a $157.7 million increase in accounts receivable, an increase of $65.2 million in inventory and an increase of $5.6 million in other current assets partially offset by a $76.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $31.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Company’s receivable securitization program and a $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million and other current assets of $7.5 million partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2010. Accounts receivable increased $269.0 million to $718.5 million, resulting from the inclusion of $82.0 million of receivables previously sold under the Company’s Receivables Securitization Facility in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2009-16 (refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and also reflecting higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $22.0 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 (“Translation”). (For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2009-16, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 68 days from 64 days in 2009. Inventory increased $87.4 million to $549.2 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity, the impact of acquisitions of $18.8 million and Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 77 and 80, respectively. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $34.1 million to $367.0 million reflecting capital expenditures of $109.5 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $14.2 million and Translation offset by depreciation of $86.1 million and disposals. Goodwill increased $164.6 million to $1,533.3 million, primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long-term assets increased $26.2 million to $123.4 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2010 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in long-term deferred tax assets of $9.2 million. Accounts payable increased $92.8 million to $385.0 million primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels and due to the impact of acquisitions of $14.8 million. Accrued acquisition-related obligations increased $32.4 million to $39.6 million, primarily reflecting contingent consideration obligations of $39.6 million relating to an acquisition completed in 2010 partially offset by payments and adjustments to accrued acquisition-related obligations relating to previous acquisitions. Other long-term liabilities increased $14.0 million to $41.9 million, primarily due to contingent consideration obligations expected to be paid in 2012 associated with the aforementioned acquisition in 2010. In 2010, cash flow provided by operating activities of $424.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $61.3 million, net borrowings of $45.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $1.9 million were used to fund acquisition-related payments of $180.4 million, capital expenditures of $109.5 million, purchases of short-term investments of $60.2 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.6 million, dividend payments of $10.4 million, and to fund fees and expenses in connection with refinancing the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility of $7.0 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $141.3 million. In 2009, cash flow provided by from operating activities of $582.3 million, proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $598.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $3.2 million were used to fund $280.0 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $63.1 million, purchases of short-term investments of $33.3 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $23.3 million, dividend payments 21 Table of Contents of $10.3 million, net repayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign debt of $631.9 million, costs related to the issuance of Senior Notes and the early extinguishment of interest rate swap agreements of $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $169.6 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $624.2 million and $422.4 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million in principal amount of its unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due in November 2014 (the “Senior Notes”) at 99.813% of their face value ($0.9 million unamortized at December 31, 2010). Net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s senior credit facility. In addition, the Company incurred fees and expenses related to the Senior Notes of $4.7 million, which were deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes as interest expense. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the Senior Notes at December 31, 2010 was approximately $638.7 million based on recent bid prices. In August 2010, the Company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1,000.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) matures in August 2014. The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay $247.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s previous senior unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2010, borrowings and availability under the facility were $103.6 million and $896.4 million, respectively. The Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 225 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and commitment fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with such financial covenants. In connection with the refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million relating to unamortized deferred debt issue costs. These costs are included in interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also paid fees and expenses of $6.9 million in conjunction with the new Revolving Credit Facility, which are deferred and amortized into interest expense through its maturity. A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Receivables Securitization Facility”). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in May 2013. In accordance with previous accounting guidance, the receivables sold under the Receivables Securitization Facility were accounted for off-balance sheet as a sale of receivables. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted ASU 2009-16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2010 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term debt. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $92.0 million. At December 31, 2009, $82.0 million of receivables were sold and were therefore not reflected in accounts receivable and long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2009-16, fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, which were included in other expense, net for prior periods, are now included in interest expense. Such fees were approximately $1.5 million for both 2010 and 2009. The carrying value of the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility approximated their fair value at December 31, 2010. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately $120.0 to $140.0 million. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2010 were $10.4 million, including those declared in 2009 and paid in 2010. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash 22 Table of Contents requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The Company had an open-market stock repurchase program (the “Program”) to repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock which expired on January 31, 2010. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under the Program or otherwise in 2010. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending January 31, 2014. The price and timing of any such purchases will depend on factors such as debt levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts; shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-16, which limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. The Company adopted ASU 2009-16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the Company’s Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow (resulting in a reduction of cash flow provided by operating activities, and increase in cash provided by financing activities, of $82.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010) and recognized as long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to the discussion of the Company’s Receivables Securitization Facility in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance to enhance disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements by requiring certain new disclosures and clarifying certain existing disclosures. This new guidance requires disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 recurring fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the new guidance requires additional information related to activities in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair 23 Table of Contents value measurements. The new guidance also expands the disclosures related to the disaggregation of assets and liabilities and information about inputs and valuation techniques. The new guidance related to Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 and the new guidance related to Level 3 fair value measurements was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and interim periods during those fiscal years. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new guidance related to Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. The Company’s adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related notes. Refer to the Fair Value Measurements disclosure in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which subject to the curtailment described below, cover its U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $18.0 million, $16.5 million and $12.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted — average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 5.20% at December 31, 2010 and 5.75% at December 31, 2009. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $19.8 million. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 10%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 9% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 7%. As of December 31, 2010, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 36% with fixed income managers and 5% in cash. As of December 31, 2009, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 38% with fixed income managers and 3% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 is approximately 8.25%. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to one of the U.S. Plans, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years of service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $2.2 million and $2.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $17.3 million and $2.6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans increased in 2010 to $179.9 million ($3.3 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2011 for unfunded foreign plans) from $176.5 million in 2009 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2009 offset by an increase in plan assets. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2011 of approximately $19.4 million, the majority of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 7% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units in accordance with ASC topic Intangibles — Goodwill and Other as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. As of June 30, 2010, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair market value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2010, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 799,992 $ 352 $ 92,548 $ 706,252 $ 840 Interest related to Senior Notes 114,000 28,500 57,000 28,500 — Operating leases 83,526 24,988 33,483 16,278 8,777 Purchase obligations 166,019 163,023 2,996 — — Accrued acquisition-related obligations (2) 59,000 40,000 19,000 — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (3) 50,809 17,122 10,740 8,384 14,563 Total (4) $ 1,273,346 $ 273,985 $ 215,767 $ 759,414 $ 24,180 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2010 were $11.1 million. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Accrued acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $15 million in 2010. The Company anticipates making a contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $15 million in 2011. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $13 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2011. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2011 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As of December 31, 2010, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $23.3 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the ASC. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2010, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.28%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2010 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2011, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 26 Table of Contents In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of the Senior Notes at 99.813% of their face value due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%.

820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2011, approximately 68% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs; · Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities; · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure; · Maintain a culture of controlling costs; and · Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $3,939.8 million, $751.7 million and $524.2 million, respectively; up 11%, 7% and 6%, respectively, from 2010. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2011, the Company generated operating cash flow of $565.2 million. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.4 67.4 68.6 Casualty loss related to flood 0.5 — — Change in contingent acquisition-related obligations (0.5 ) — — Acquisition-related expenses 0.1 — — Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.4 12.9 14.1 Operating income 19.1 19.7 17.3 Interest expense (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.3 ) Early extinguishment of interest rate swaps — — (0.2 ) Other income (expense), net 0.2 0.1 — Income before income taxes 18.2 18.6 15.8 Provision for income taxes (4.8 ) (4.5 ) (4.2 ) Net income 13.4 14.1 11.6 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.3 % 14.0 % 11.3 % 18 Table of Contents 2011 Compared to 2010 Net sales were $3,939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $3,554.1 million for 2010, an increase of 11% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 6% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2011 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 7% organically compared to 2010 ($3,666.0 million in 2011 versus $3,293.1 million in 2010) driven by strength in the wireless devices, automotive, industrial, and commercial aerospace markets. Sales to the wireless devices market increased (approximately $195.4 million), primarily due to increased smart wireless device and tablet computer demand. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $101.0 million) driven primarily by new electronics applications as well as from the impact of two acquisitions made during the year. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $71.3 million), primarily reflecting increased sales to alternative energy, oil and gas and heavy equipment markets. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $36.0 million), primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as next generation jet liner production. This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market (approximately $9.5 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and also due to the approximately $18.0 million business interruption impact from the flood at the Company’s Sidney, New York facility in early September 2011 as further described below (the “Flood Impact”), partially offset by acquisition growth from a 2010 acquisition and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market (approximately $21.7 million), primarily due to slowed demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Sales of cable products in 2011 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2010 ($273.7 million in 2011 versus $261.0 million in 2010), primarily due to increased spending in South American wireless infrastructure markets during the year, partially offset by lower spending in broadband communications markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2011 increased approximately 1% ($1,268.9 million in 2011 versus $1,258.2 million in 2010) compared to 2010. International sales for 2011 increased approximately 16% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies ($2,670.9 million in 2011 versus $2,296.0 million in 2010) compared to 2010 with particular strength in Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2011 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $59.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2010. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.6% in 2011 compared to 32.6% in 2010. The operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment decreased approximately 0.5% compared to the prior year, as a result of the impacts of increases in input costs primarily due to higher commodity prices. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. The operating margins for the Cable Products segment decreased 0.9%, primarily as a result of higher relative material costs. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State in early September 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company recorded a charge of $21.5 million ($13.5 million after taxes), for property-related damage, as well as cleanup and repair efforts incurred through December 31, 2011, net of insurance recoveries. This charge includes the Company’s loss for damaged inventory and machinery and equipment. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity primarily during the third quarter of 2011, but the plant was substantially back to full production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reassessed, based on current 2011 performance expectations, a contingent acquisition-related obligation which would have been payable in 2012 related to a 2010 acquisition (Note 3). Performance expectations were reduced as a result of a softening in demand in the defense market and the related deferral of certain defense related programs to periods beyond 2011 and therefore outside the contractual earn-out period. Therefore, it was determined that the payment related to 2011 profitability levels was no longer probable and the Company adjusted the remaining contingent consideration liability of $17.8 million as a gain in operating income as separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Based on the actual 2011 results of the acquired company, it has been determined that the 2012 contingent consideration payment is in fact not payable. This adjustment had an impact of $11.2 million on net income, or $0.06 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2011 in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $486.3 million and $457.9 million in 2011 and 2010, or approximately 12% and 13% of net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $10.4 million in 2011 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee-related costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $11.3 million in 2011, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. Administrative expenses increased approximately $6.7 million in 2011, primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, salaries and employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. 19 Table of Contents Interest expense was $43.0 million for 2011 compared to $40.7 million for 2010. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the Company’s stock repurchase program (Note 7), partially offset by lower average borrowing costs. Other income, net, was $8.1 million for 2011 compared to $4.1 million for 2010, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2011 and 24.3% in 2010. The 2011 and 2010 tax rates reflect a reduction in tax expense of $4.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 was 26.8% and 27.4%, respectively. The Company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2008 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $21.9 million, the majority of which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $3.8 million. 20 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Net sales were $3,554.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2,820.1 million for 2009, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 22% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2010 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 28% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currencies compared to 2009 ($3,293.1 million in 2010 versus $2,566.6 million in 2009). Sales increased in all of the Company’s major end markets, including the telecommunications and data communications, wireless communications, industrial, military/aerospace and automotive markets as a result of a broad strengthening from a product, customer and geographic perspective and to a lesser extent from acquisitions. Sales to the telecommunications and data communications market increased (approximately $202.7 million) primarily due to increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment. The wireless communications market sales increased (approximately $181.3 million) in all areas, including the wireless device market, primarily related to higher handset and tablet computer demand and in the wireless infrastructure market due to higher cell site installation demand, which also drove higher demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $163.9 million) primarily reflecting increased sales to the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased (approximately $125.2 million), primarily due to higher demand in the defense market and to a lesser extent the commercial market. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $42.8 million) primarily due to the increased demand in the European and U.S. automotive markets including the ramp up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sales of cable products in 2010 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 3% in U.S. dollars and were relatively flat in local currencies compared to 2009 ($261.0 million in 2010 versus $253.5 million in 2009), primarily attributed to an increase in spending in international broadband communications markets, partially offset by lower spending in North American broadband communications markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2010 increased approximately 26% ($1,258.2 million in 2010 versus $1,001.7 million in 2009) compared to 2009. International sales for 2010 increased approximately 26% both in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($2,296.0 million in 2010 versus $1,818.3 million in 2009) compared to 2009. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2010 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $1.1 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2009. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.6% in 2010 compared to 31.4% in 2009. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs. Cable operating margins decreased 1.7% primarily as a result of higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $457.9 million and $397.6 million in 2010 and 2009, or approximately 13% and 14% of net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $17.1 million in 2010 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $13.6 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Administrative expenses increased approximately $29.6 million, primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, amortization of identified intangible assets and employee incentive payments, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2010 and 2009. Interest expense was $40.7 million for 2010 compared to $36.6 million for 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of fees of $1.5 million in 2010 on the Company’s Receivables Securitization Facility in interest expense (included in other expense, net in 2009) in accordance with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (“ASU 2009-16”), which was effective January 1, 2010 (Note 2) and is also attributable to one-time expenses of $0.5 million for the early extinguishment of the Company’s previous credit facility and a full year of deferred debt issue costs in the 2010 related to the Senior Notes issuance in November 2009. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.3% in 2010 and 26.7% in 2009. The 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $20.7 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. The 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these adjustments, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 27.4% and 27.5%, respectively. The Company operates in over fifty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2007 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of 21 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $23.3 million, the majority of which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $565.2 million for 2011 compared to $424.9 million for 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the 2010 period includes the effect of adoption of FASB ASU 2009-16, which became effective January 1, 2010 and resulted in a decrease to cash flow provided by operating activities of $82.0 million in 2010. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to 2010 (excluding the effect of adoption of ASU 2009-16 in 2010) is primarily due to increases in net income and non-cash expenses, including a casualty loss related to the flood, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as a decrease in other long-term assets primarily related to deferred income taxes, partially offset by an increase in components of working capital and a non-cash change in contingent acquisition-related obligations. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $110.3 million in 2011 due primarily to increases in inventory, accounts receivable, and other current assets of $88.5 million, $9.7 million, $8.9 million, respectively, and a decrease of $27.5 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $120.1 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $157.7 million, $65.2 million, $5.6 million, respectively, partially offset by a $76.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $31.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital decreased $125.6 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets of $96.6 million, $76.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, partially offset by a $31.7 million decrease in accounts payable, a $3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the Company’s receivable securitization program and $2.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2011. Accounts receivable increased $48.6 million to $767.2 million resulting from higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $34.8 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 71 days from 68 days in 2010. Inventory increased $100.7 million to $649.9 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity, a planned increase in certain raw materials due to expected increases in commodity prices, the increase of certain inventory to support first quarter 2012 sales and the impact of acquisitions of $19.0 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 89 and 77, respectively. Other current assets increased $15.1 million to $115.3 million, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of a foreign exchange forward contract as well as increases in VAT-related receivables and deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $13.5 million to $380.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $100.2 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $28.5 million offset by depreciation of $101.6 million and disposals of $13.2 million, which included a write-off of certain flood damaged assets. Goodwill increased $212.8 million to $1,746.1 million, primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during the year. Other long-term assets increased $13.9 million to $137.4 million, primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2011 acquisitions. Accounts payable decreased $7.1 million to $377.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in days payable and also due to accelerated payments for certain commodities, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of $13.4 million and Translation. Total accrued expenses decreased $5.4 million to $264.3 million, primarily due to the payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $40.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes of $22.0 million and Translation. Accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations increased $30.4 million due primarily to an increase in the projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption. Other long-term liabilities decreased $7.8 million to $34.1 million, primarily due to the reduction in an acquisition-related contingent payment obligation of $17.8 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities. In 2011, cash flow provided by operating activities of $565.2 million, net borrowings of $569.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $32.1 million, proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $8.1 million, and the change in cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $672.2 million, acquisition-related payments of $303.3 million, capital expenditures of $100.2 million, contingent acquisition-related obligation payments of $40.0 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $35.5 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $30.0 million and dividend payments of $10.3 million. In 2010, cash flow provided by operating activities of $424.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $61.3 million, net borrowings of $45.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $1.9 million were used to fund acquisition-related payments of $180.4 million, capital expenditures of $109.5 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $60.2 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.6 million, dividend payments of $10.4 million, and to fund fees and expenses in connection with refinancing the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility of $7.0 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $141.3 million. 23 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $648.9 million and $624.2 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company does not intend to repatriate these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due November 2014 (the “4.75% Senior Notes”) at 99.813% of their face value. Interest on the 4.75% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.75% Senior Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The 4.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.75% Senior Notes at December 31, 2011 was approximately $643.0 million based on recent bid prices. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the “4.00% Senior Notes”) at 99.746% of their face value. Net proceeds from the sale of the 4.00% Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the 4.00% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2012, to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.00% Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, plus a make-whole premium (if redeemed prior to November 1, 2021). The 4.00% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. In June 2011, the Company amended its $1,000.0 million unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to reduce borrowing costs and to extend the maturity date from August 2014 to July 2016. At December 31, 2011, borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility were $692.4 million and $307.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was at a spread over LIBOR. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company paid fees and expenses of approximately $2.1 million related to the amendment, which were deferred and are being amortized as interest expense through the amended maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. A subsidiary of the Company has entered into a Receivables Securitization Facility with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Receivables Securitization Facility”). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain covenants, provides for various events of termination. In accordance with previous accounting guidance, the receivables sold under the Receivables Securitization Facility were accounted for off-balance sheet as sales of receivables. The Company adopted FASB ASU 2009-16 on January 1, 2010. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the Receivables Securitization Facility as a sale. In addition, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term debt. At December 31, 2011, borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $81.7 million. Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2009-16, fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility are included in interest expense. Such fees were approximately $1.6 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In January 2012, the Company amended the Receivable Securitization Facility to reduce certain fees and amend the expiration date to January 2013. The carrying value of borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility approximated their fair value at December 31, 2011. The Company had $24.9 million of issued and unused letters of credit at December 31, 2011. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2012 will be approximately $110 to $130 million. On January 26, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2012 dividend on its common stock in the amount of $.105 per share. This represents an increase in the quarterly dividend from $.015 to $.105 per share effective with the first quarter 2012 dividend, which will be paid in April 2012. Cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2011 were $10.3 million, including those declared in 2010 and paid in 2011. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility. 24 Table of Contents The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending January 31, 2014 (the “Program”). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased 13.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $672.2 million. These treasury shares have been or will be retired by the Company and common stock and accumulated earnings were reduced accordingly. The price and timing of any such purchases under the Program after December 31, 2011 will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. As of December 31, 2011, 6.6 million shares of common stock may be repurchased under the Program. Through February 17, 2012, the Company has repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $60.2 million. At February 17, 2012, approximately 5.5 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the Program. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts; shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. 25 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASU 2011-08”), which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will consider this update when performing its annual impairment assessment in the third quarter of 2012. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2011-05”). ASU 2011-05 requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied retrospectively. The Company has adopted this update and presented the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income immediately following the Consolidated Statements of Income. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including (1) the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, (2) measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity, and (3) quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2011-04 also provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio, and application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement. In addition, ASU 2011-04 requires additional disclosure for Level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs. The amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which, cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $19.1 million, $18.0 million and $16.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 4.45% at December 31, 2011 and 5.20% at December 31, 2010. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $21.0 million. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 9% and 40% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 7%. As of December 31, 2011, the asset allocation was 62% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers and 1% in cash. As of December 31, 2010, the asset allocation was 59% with equity managers and 36% with fixed income managers and 5% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted 26 Table of Contents allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at both December 31, 2011 and 2010 is approximately 8.25%, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $22.8 million and $17.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans increased in 2011 to $210.3 million ($3.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2012 for unfunded foreign plans) from $179.9 million in 2010 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2010. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2012 of approximately $26.0 million, most of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $2.5 million and $2.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 7% of consolidated sales in 2011), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each June 30. The Company has determined that its reporting units are its two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. As of June 30, 2011, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized. 27 Table of Contents Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2011, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $2.1 billion. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries could bring additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2011, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 1,377,129 $ 298 $ 682,135 $ 694,696 $ — Interest related to 4.75% Senior Notes 85,500 28,500 57,000 — — Operating leases 74,441 27,315 32,172 13,482 1,472 Purchase obligations 168,991 167,295 1,696 — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (2) 56,315 25,721 8,503 8,042 14,049 Total (3) $ 1,762,376 $ 249,129 $ 781,506 $ 716,220 $ 15,521 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2011 were $13.7 million, including amortization of the fees related to the amendment of the Revolving Credit Facility. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $20.0 million in 2011. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $21.2 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2012. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2012 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2011, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $21.9 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. 29 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had foreign currency rate protection in the form of forward contracts that effectively fixed a Hong Kong dollar denominated intercompany debt obligation of 1,202.3 million Hong Kong dollars into a fixed euro denominated obligation expiring in November 2012 concurrent with the underlying loan. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk Outstanding borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.29%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2011 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2012, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of 4.75% Senior Notes at 99.813% of their face value due in November 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million of 4.00% Senior Notes at 99.746% of their face value due in February 2022 with a fixed interest rate of 4.00%. Proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 30 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:50.256131
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2012, approximately 68% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Focus on customer needs; · Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities; · Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure; · Maintain a culture of controlling costs; and · Pursue strategic acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $4,292.1 million, $828.3 million and $555.3 million, respectively; up 9%, 10% and 6%, respectively, from 2011. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2012, the Company generated operating cash flow of $674.7 million. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.7 68.4 67.4 Casualty loss related to flood — 0.5 — Change in contingent acquisition-related obligations — (0.5 ) — Acquisition-related expenses — 0.1 — Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.0 12.4 12.9 Operating income 19.3 19.1 19.7 Interest expense (1.4 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) Other income, net 0.2 0.2 0.1 Income before income taxes 18.1 18.2 18.6 Provision for income taxes (5.1 ) (4.8 ) (4.5 ) Net income 13.0 13.4 14.1 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 12.9 % 13.3 % 14.0 % 17 Table of Contents 2012 Compared to 2011 Net sales were $4,292.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $3,939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 5% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2012 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 5% organically compared to 2011 ($3,987.3 million in 2012 versus $3,666.0 million in 2011). The Company achieved strong organic growth in the automotive, industrial, mobile devices, information technology (“IT”) and data communication equipment, and commercial aerospace markets. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $121.7 million), driven primarily by acquisitions and growth in new electronics applications. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $79.2 million), primarily reflecting acquisitions and increased sales to the alternative energy and oil and gas markets. Sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $69.6 million), primarily due to increased demand on new mobile computing platforms. Sales to the IT and data communication equipment market increased (approximately $63.6 million), primarily due to increased sales of high speed and power products in latest generation servers. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $38.0 million), primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as new airplane platforms. This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market (approximately $22.9 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market (approximately $26.6 million), primarily due to slowed demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Sales in the Cable Products segment in 2012 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currencies and 8% organically compared to 2011 ($304.8 million in 2012 versus $273.7 million in 2011). Organic growth was primarily due to increased demand in broadband markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2012 increased approximately 9% ($1,379.7 million in 2012 versus $1,268.9 million in 2011) compared to 2011. International sales for 2012 increased approximately 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies ($2,912.4 million in 2012 versus $2,670.9 million in 2011) compared to 2011 with particular strength in Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2012 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $48.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2011. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.3% in 2012 compared to 31.6% in 2011. The decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to lower margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due primarily to product mix, partially offset by increased margins in the Cable Products segment, primarily as a result of higher volumes and favorable product mix from an acquisition in 2012. Operating margin in the Interconnect Product and Assemblies segment was 21.5% of sales in both 2012 and 2011 as the lower gross margin was offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses. Operating margin in the Cable Products segment increased to 13.5% in 2012 from 12.7% of sales in 2011, primarily as a result of higher gross margins. On a consolidated basis, operating margins improved from 19.1% in 2011 to 19.3% in 2012. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in both 2012 and 2011 in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, these expenses had an impact of $2.0 million and $1.8 million on net income, respectively, or $0.01 per share for each year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $512.9 million and $486.3 million in 2012 and 2011. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased approximately 5% in 2012 over 2011, compared to a 9% increase in sales, and therefore, declined as a percentage of sales from 12.4% in 2011 to 12.0% in 2012. The decrease as a percentage of sales relates primarily to cost control actions and product mix. Administrative expenses increased approximately $24.5 million in 2012, primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, salaries and employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.7% and 4.5% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $3.6 million in 2012, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% and 2.3% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses in 2012 were consistent with amounts incurred in 2011 and represented approximately 5.1% and 5.6% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest expense was $59.6 million for 2012 compared to $43.0 million for 2011. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the stock repurchases made under the 2011 Program and higher average borrowing costs due primarily to the issuance of the 4.00% Senior Notes in January 2012. Other income, net, was $10.1 million for 2012 compared to $8.1 million for 2011, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 28.2% in 2012 and 26.2% in 2011. The 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of $11.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. Under 18 Table of Contents U.S. GAAP, the related benefit to the company of $11.3 million relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement; as such, between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, there is no net impact on the Company from an income statement perspective. The 2011 tax rate reflects a decrease of $4.5 million, relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these adjustments as well as the net impact of the acquisition related expenses, the loss incurred related to the 2011 Sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 was 26.7% and 26.8%, respectively. The Company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2009 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2012, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $16.2 million, the majority of which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $5.6 million. 2011 Compared to 2010 Net sales were $3,939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $3,554.1 million for 2010, an increase of 11% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 6% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2011 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 7% organically compared to 2010 ($3,666.0 million in 2011 versus $3,293.1 million in 2010) driven by strength in the wireless devices, automotive, industrial, and commercial aerospace markets. Sales to the wireless devices market increased (approximately $195.4 million), primarily due to increased smart wireless device and tablet computer demand. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $101.0 million) driven primarily by new electronics applications as well as from the impact of two acquisitions made during the year. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $71.3 million), primarily reflecting increased sales to alternative energy, oil and gas and heavy equipment markets. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $36.0 million), primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as next generation jet liner production. This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market (approximately $9.5 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and also due to the approximately $18.0 million business interruption impact from the flood at the Company’s Sidney, New York facility in early September 2011 as further described below (the “Flood Impact”), partially offset by acquisition growth from a 2010 acquisition and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market (approximately $21.7 million), primarily due to slowed demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Sales in the Cable Products segment in 2011 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2010 ($273.7 million in 2011 versus $261.0 million in 2010), primarily due to increased spending in South American wireless infrastructure markets during the year, partially offset by lower spending in broadband communications markets. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2011 increased approximately 1% ($1,268.9 million in 2011 versus $1,258.2 million in 2010) compared to 2010. International sales for 2011 increased approximately 16% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies ($2,670.9 million in 2011 versus $2,296.0 million in 2010) compared to 2010 with particular strength in Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2011 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $59.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2010. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.6% in 2011 compared to 32.6% in 2010. The operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment decreased approximately 0.5% compared to the prior year, as a result of the impacts of increases in input costs primarily due to higher commodity prices. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. The operating margins for the Cable Products segment decreased 0.9%, primarily as a result of higher relative material costs. The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State in early September 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company recorded a charge of $21.5 million ($13.5 million after taxes) or $0.08 per share, for property-related damage, as well as cleanup and repair efforts incurred through December 31, 2011, net of insurance recoveries. This charge includes the Company’s loss for damaged inventory and machinery and equipment. The Sidney, New York manufacturing facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity primarily during the third quarter of 2011, but the plant was substantially back to full production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. 19 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reassessed, based on current 2011 performance expectations, a contingent acquisition-related obligation which would have been payable in 2012 related to a 2010 acquisition (Note 3). Performance expectations were reduced as a result of a softening in demand in the defense market and the related deferral of certain defense related programs to periods beyond 2011 and therefore outside the contractual earn-out period. Therefore, it was determined that the payment related to 2011 profitability levels was no longer probable and the Company adjusted the remaining contingent consideration liability of $17.8 million as a gain in operating income as separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Based on the actual 2011 results of the acquired company, it has been determined that the 2012 contingent consideration payment is in fact not payable. This adjustment had an impact of $11.2 million on net income, or $0.06 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2011. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2011, or $0.01 per share, in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $486.3 million and $457.9 million in 2011 and 2010, or approximately 12% and 13% of net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $10.4 million in 2011 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee-related costs. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $11.3 million in 2011, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. Administrative expenses increased approximately $6.7 million in 2011, primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, salaries and employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 5% of sales for both 2011 and 2010. Interest expense was $43.0 million for 2011 compared to $40.7 million for 2010. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the Company’s stock repurchase program (Note 7), partially offset by lower average borrowing costs. Other income, net, was $8.1 million for 2011 compared to $4.1 million for 2010, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2011 and 24.3% in 2010. The 2011 and 2010 tax rates reflect a reduction in tax expense of $4.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these adjustments as well as the net impact of acquisition related expenses, the loss related to the 2011 Sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 was 26.8% and 27.4%, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $674.7 million for 2012 compared to $565.2 million for 2011. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in components of working capital, partially offset by a net increase in other long-term assets. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $565.2 million for 2011 compared to $424.9 million for 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the 2010 period includes the effect of adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-16 (“ASU 2009-16”), which became effective January 1, 2010 and resulted in a decrease to cash flow provided by operating activities of $82.0 million in 2010. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to 2010 (excluding the effect of adoption of ASU 2009-16 in 2010) is primarily due to an increase in net income, a lower increase in components of working capital and a decrease in other long-term assets primarily related to deferred income taxes. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $8.9 million in 2012 due primarily to increases in inventory and accounts receivable of $45.9 million and $123.9 million, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.4 million and $61.5 million, respectively. The components of working capital increased $110.3 million in 2011 due primarily to increases in inventory, accounts receivable, and other current assets of $88.5 million, $9.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, and a decrease of $27.5 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in accrued liabilities. The components of working capital increased $120.1 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $157.7 million, $65.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, partially offset by a $76.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $31.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2012. Accounts receivable increased $143.5 million to $910.7 million resulting from higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $15.6 million and translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 72 days and 71 days, respectively. Inventory increased $83.9 million to $733.7 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity and the impact of acquisitions of $35.9 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 83 and 89, respectively. Other current assets increased $4.7 20 Table of Contents million to $120.0 million, primarily due to increases in value added tax and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of a settled foreign exchange forward contract. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $36.9 million to $417.4 million reflecting capital expenditures of $129.1 million, as well as fixed assets from acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $98.6 million and disposals. Goodwill increased $186.6 million to $1,932.7 million, primarily as a result of four acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and one acquisition in the Cable Products segment completed during 2012. Other long-term assets increased $21.0 million to $158.4 million, primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions in 2012. Accounts payable increased $118.7 million to $496.5 million, primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels and due to the impact of acquisitions and Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 56 and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses increased $27.4 million to $291.7 million, primarily due to increases in accrued interest, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, and accrued income taxes. Accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations increased $37.5 million to $244.6 million due primarily to an increase in the projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption. In 2012, cash flow provided by operating activities of $674.7 million, net borrowings of $325.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $117.1 million, and proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $4.8 million, were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $380.0 million, acquisition-related payments of $251.5 million, capital expenditures of $129.1 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $117.8 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $5.2 million and dividend payments of $70.1 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $175.8 million. In 2011, cash flow provided by operating activities of $565.2 million, net borrowings of $569.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $32.1 million, proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $8.1 million, and cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $672.2 million, acquisition-related payments of $303.3 million, capital expenditures of $100.2 million, contingent acquisition-related obligation payments of $40.0 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $35.5 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $30.0 million and dividend payments of $10.3 million. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $942.5 million and $648.9 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. In June 2011, the Company amended its $1,000.0 million unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to reduce borrowing costs and to extend the maturity date from August 2014 to July 2016. At December 31, 2012, borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility were $500.4 million and $499.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was at a spread over LIBOR. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due November 2014 (the “4.75% Senior Notes”) at 99.813% of their face value. Interest on the 4.75% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.75% Senior Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The 4.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.75% Senior Notes at December 31, 2012 was approximately $640.0 million based on recent bid prices. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the “4.00% Senior Notes”) at 99.746% of their face value. Net proceeds from the sale of the 4.00% Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the 4.00% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2012, to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.00% Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, plus a make-whole premium (if redeemed prior to November 1, 2021). The 4.00% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.00% Senior Notes at December 31, 2012 was approximately $533.0 million based on recent bid prices. A subsidiary of the Company has entered into a Receivables Securitization Facility with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Receivables Securitization Facility”). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The 21 Table of Contents Receivables Securitization Facility includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. Transfers of receivables are reflected as debt issued in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term debt. At December 31, 2012, borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $100.0 million. Fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility are included in interest expense. Such fees were approximately $1.0 million, $1.6 million, and $1.5 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In January 2013, the Company extended the Receivables Securitization Facility to amend the expiration date to January 2014. The carrying value of borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility approximated their fair value at December 31, 2012 due to their relative short-term maturities and market interest rates. The Company had $14.6 million of issued and unused letters of credit at December 31, 2012. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2013 will be approximately $150 to $170 million. After declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company paid a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.105 per share in 2012 and $0.015 per share in 2011. Total dividends declared during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $67.7 million, $10.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2012 were $70.1 million, including those declared in 2011 and paid in 2012, total dividends paid in 2011 were $10.3 million, including those declared in 2010 and paid in 2011, and total dividends paid in 2010 were $10.4 million, including those declared in 2009 and paid in 2010. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Securitization Facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending January 31, 2014 (the “2011 Program”). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, the Company repurchased 6.6 million shares of its common stock under the 2011 Program for approximately $380.0 million. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and accumulated earnings were reduced accordingly. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had repurchased all shares authorized under the 2011 Program. In January 2013, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock during the two year period ending January 31, 2015 (the “2013 Program”). The price and timing of any such purchases under the 2013 Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. Through February 15, 2013, the Company has repurchased 0.7 million shares of its common stock under the 2013 Program for $50.3 million. These treasury shares will be retired by the Company and common stock and accumulated earnings will be reduced accordingly. At February 15, 2013, approximately 9.3 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the 2013 Program. Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the Sidney landfill, all as referred to above. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. The environmental investigation, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 22 Table of Contents Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon information currently known by management about the Company’s manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters, that any such liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2013-02”). The update requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present either on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2013. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2011-08”), which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2012. The Company utilized the option to assess qualitative factors pursuant to this update when performing its 2012 annual impairment assessment. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including (1) the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, (2) measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity, and (3) quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2011-04 also provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio, and application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement. In addition, ASU 2011-04 requires additional disclosure for Level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs. The amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively, and were 23 Table of Contents effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $25.2 million, $19.1 million and $18.0 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 3.75% at December 31, 2012 and 4.45% at December 31, 2011. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $23.0 million. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. As described above, the expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 9%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 7%). As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the asset allocation was 62% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers and 1% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is approximately 8.00% and 8.25%, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $21.8 million, $22.8 million and $17.3 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans increased in 2012 to $246.6 million ($3.7 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2013 for unfunded foreign plans) from $210.3 million in 2011 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2011. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2013 of approximately $21.0 million, most of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $2.7 million, $2.5 million and $2.2 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 8% of consolidated sales in 2012), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2012, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test in accordance with ASU 2011-08, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other: Testing for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2011-08”), which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2012. Under this amendment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. As of June 30, 2012, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values and therefore, the Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2012, 2011, or 2010 in connection with its annual impairment test. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors (Note 9). Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2012, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $2.2 billion. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2012, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 1,706,497 $ 100,293 $ 600,498 $ 506,860 $ 498,846 Interest related to 4.75% Senior Notes 57,000 28,500 28,500 — — Interest related to 4.00% Senior Notes 190,000 20,000 40,000 40,000 90,000 Operating leases 82,743 30,856 38,680 12,609 598 Purchase obligations 179,801 177,879 1,922 — — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (2) 47,248 15,174 8,605 8,305 15,164 Total (3) $ 2,263,289 $ 372,702 $ 718,205 $ 567,774 $ 604,608 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2012 were $8.3 million. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $18.5 million in 2012. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $9.2 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2013. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2013 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2012, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $16.2 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had foreign currency rate protection in the form of forward contracts that effectively fixed a Hong Kong dollar denominated intercompany debt obligation of 1,202.3 million Hong Kong dollars into a fixed euro denominated obligation expiring in November 2013 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loan. The Company also had a forward contract that effectively fixed a Hong Kong dollar denominated intercompany debt obligation of 604.7 million Hong Kong dollars into a fixed U.S. dollar denominated obligation expiring in November 2013 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loan. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. As of December 31, 2012, $608.1 million, or 36% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, were subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. The Company has $600.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes due November 2014 outstanding, which were issued at 99.813% of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. The Company has $500.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes due February 2022 outstanding, which were issued at 99.746% of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 4.00%. Outstanding borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.21%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2012 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2013, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 27 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:48.393089
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensor and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2013, approximately 69% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Pursue broad diversification; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. 16 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $4,614.7 million, $896.8 million and $635.7 million, respectively, up 8%, 8% and 14%, respectively, from 2012. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2013, the Company generated operating cash flow of $769.1 million. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.5 68.7 68.4 Casualty loss related to flood — — 0.5 Change in contingent acquisition-related obligations — — (0.5 ) Acquisition-related expenses 0.2 — 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.9 12.0 12.4 Operating income 19.4 19.3 19.1 Interest expense (1.4 ) (1.4 ) (1.1 ) Other income, net 0.3 0.2 0.2 Income before income taxes 18.3 18.1 18.2 Provision for income taxes (4.5 ) (5.1 ) (4.8 ) Net income 13.8 13.0 13.4 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests — (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.8 % 12.9 % 13.3 % 2013 Compared to 2012 Net sales were $4,614.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $4,292.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 8% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 4% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 7% in 2013 in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 4% organically compared to 2012 ($4,269.0 million in 2013 versus $3,987.3 million in 2012). The sales growth was driven by increases in nearly all of our served markets with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $104.0 million), driven primarily by participation in new programs, higher vehicle volumes and acquisitions. Sales to the IT and data communications equipment market increased (approximately $57.7 million), primarily due to broad-based strength in servers, storage and network hardware. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $54.0 million) due to increased demand driven by higher levels of airplane production and new airplane platforms and acquisitions. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $42.9 million), primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $23.0 million), primarily due to an increase in worldwide network build-outs with particular strength in North America and Europe. Sales to the mobile devices market increased slightly (approximately $4.6 million). This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military market (approximately $9.8 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties. Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 13% in 2013 in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies and were down 3% organically compared to 2012 ($345.7 million in 2013 versus $304.8 million in 2012). Increased sales levels were due to a 2012 acquisition which was partially offset by overall lower spending at cable operators. Cable Products and Solutions sales are primarily in the broadband communications market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2013 increased approximately 4% ($1,430.6 million in 2013 versus $1,379.7 million in 2012) compared to 2012. International sales for 2013 increased approximately 9% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($3,184.1 million in 2013 versus $2,912.4 million in 2012) compared to 2012 with particular strength in Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2013 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $15.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2012. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.5% in 2013 compared to 31.3% in 2012. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due primarily to increased volume and cost reduction actions. Operating margin in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment was 21.8% 17 Table of Contents and 21.5% of sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Operating margin in the Cable Products and Solutions segment decreased to 13.4% in 2013 from 13.5% of sales in 2012, primarily as a result of market pricing and product mix. On a consolidated basis, operating income margin was 19.4%, up 10 basis points from 2012, which included the impact of acquisition-related expenses discussed below. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $6.0 million and $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2013 and 2012, respectively, in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. These expenses include professional fees, transaction-related fees and other external expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, these expenses had an impact on net income of $4.6 million, or $0.02 per share, and $2.0 million, or $0.01 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, operating income margin was 19.6% in 2013 compared to 19.3% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $548.1 million and $512.9 million in 2013 and 2012 and represented approximately 11.9% of net sales for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Administrative expenses increased approximately $9.9 million in 2013 primarily related to increases in employee related benefits, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 4.6% and 4.7% of net sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Research and development expenses increased approximately $11.0 million in 2013 reflecting increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% of net sales for both 2013 and 2012. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $14.3 million in 2013 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both 2013 and 2012. Interest expense was $63.6 million for 2013 compared to $59.6 million for 2012. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels from the Company’s acquisitions and stock repurchase programs. Other income, net, was $13.4 million for 2013 compared to $10.1 million for 2012, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.6% in 2013 and 28.2% in 2012. The 2013 tax rate reflects a decrease in tax expense and the 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of $11.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. Under U.S. GAAP, the benefit to the Company of $11.3 million relating to the 2012 tax year was recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement; as such, between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, there is no net impact on the Company from an income statement perspective. The 2013 tax rate also reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisition-related expenses, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was 26.3% and 26.7%, respectively. The Company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2010 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $14.9 million, the majority of which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.8 million. 2012 Compared to 2011 Net sales were $4,292.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $3,939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 5% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2012 (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 5% organically compared to 2011 ($3,987.3 million in 2012 versus $3,666.0 million in 2011). The Company achieved strong organic growth in the automotive, industrial, mobile devices, IT and data communications equipment, and commercial aerospace markets. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $121.7 million), driven primarily by acquisitions and growth in new electronics applications. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $79.2 million), 18 Table of Contents primarily reflecting acquisitions and increased sales to the alternative energy and oil and gas markets. Sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $69.6 million), primarily due to increased demand on new mobile computing platforms. Sales to the IT and data communications equipment market increased (approximately $63.6 million), primarily due to increased sales of high speed and power products in latest generation servers. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $38.0 million), primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as new airplane platforms. This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military market (approximately $22.9 million), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and a reduction in sales to the mobile networks market (approximately $26.6 million), primarily due to slowed demand at base station/equipment manufacturers. Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2012 (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currencies and 8% organically compared to 2011 ($304.8 million in 2012 versus $273.7 million in 2011). Organic growth was primarily due to increased demand in the broadband communications market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2012 increased approximately 9% ($1,379.7 million in 2012 versus $1,268.9 million in 2011) compared to 2011. International sales for 2012 increased approximately 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies ($2,912.4 million in 2012 versus $2,670.9 million in 2011) compared to 2011 with particular strength in Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2012 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $48.3 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2011. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.3% in 2012 compared to 31.6% in 2011. The decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to lower margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due primarily to product mix, partially offset by increased margins in the Cable Products and Solutions segment, primarily as a result of higher volumes and favorable product mix from an acquisition in 2012. Operating margin in the Interconnect Product and Assemblies segment was 21.5% of sales in both 2012 and 2011 as the lower gross margin was offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses. Operating margin in the Cable Products and Solutions segment increased to 13.5% in 2012 from 12.7% of sales in 2011, primarily as a result of higher gross margins. On a consolidated basis, operating margins improved from 19.1% in 2011 to 19.3% in 2012. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in both 2012 and 2011 in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, these expenses had an impact of $2.0 million and $1.8 million on net income, respectively, or $0.01 per share for each year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $512.9 million and $486.3 million in 2012 and 2011. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased approximately 5% in 2012 over 2011, compared to a 9% increase in sales, and therefore, declined as a percentage of sales from 12.4% in 2011 to 12.0% in 2012. The decrease as a percentage of sales relates primarily to cost control actions and product mix. Administrative expenses increased approximately $24.5 million in 2012, primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, salaries and employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.7% and 4.5% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $3.6 million in 2012, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% and 2.3% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses in 2012 were consistent with amounts incurred in 2011 and represented approximately 5.1% and 5.6% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest expense was $59.6 million for 2012 compared to $43.0 million for 2011. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the stock repurchases made under the 2011 Program and higher average borrowing costs due primarily to the issuance of the 4.00% Senior Notes in January 2012. Other income, net, was $10.1 million for 2012 compared to $8.1 million for 2011, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 28.2% in 2012 and 26.2% in 2011. The 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of $11.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. Under U.S. GAAP, the benefit to the company of $11.3 million relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement; as such, between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, there is no net impact on the Company from an income statement perspective. The 2011 tax rate reflects a decrease of $4.5 million, relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisition-related expenses, the loss incurred related to the 2011 Sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 was 26.7% and 26.8%, respectively. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $769.1 million for 2013 compared to $674.7 million for 2012. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a net decrease in other long-term assets partially offset by a higher increase in components of working capital. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $674.7 million for 2012 compared to $565.2 million for 2011. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in components of working capital, partially offset by a net increase in other long-term assets. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $26.3 million in 2013 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $37.0 million, $8.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.9 million and $30.2 million, respectively. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $8.9 million in 2012 due primarily to increases in inventory and accounts receivable of $45.9 million and $123.9 million, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.4 million and $61.5 million, respectively. The components of working capital increased $110.3 million in 2011 due primarily to increases in inventory, accounts receivable, and other current assets of $88.5 million, $9.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, and a decrease of $27.5 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in accrued liabilities. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2013. Accounts receivable increased $90.3 million to $1,001.0 million resulting from higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $48.0 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 70 days and 72 days, respectively. Inventory increased $58.9 million to $792.6 million, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity and the impact of acquisitions of $48.7 million. Inventory days at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 80 and 83, respectively. Other current assets increased $51.8 million to $171.7 million, primarily due to increases in value added tax and other receivables and the impact of acquisitions of $26.9 million. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $115.0 million to $532.4 million reflecting capital expenditures of $158.3 million, fixed assets from acquisitions of $66.2 million and Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $113.0 million and disposals. Goodwill and other long term assets increased $386.9 million to $2,478.0 million, primarily as a result of five acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during 2013 and Translation. Accounts payable increased $53.4 million to $549.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $33.6 million and Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 56 days. Total accrued expenses increased $66.7 million to $358.5 million, primarily due to increases in accrued salaries and the impact of acquisitions of $52.4 million. Accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations decreased $64.6 million to $180.0 million due primarily to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as a result of an increase in the discount rate assumption. Other long-term liabilities increased $32.6 million due primarily to an increase in deferred tax liabilities. In 2013, cash flow provided by operating activities of $769.1 million, net borrowings of $418.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $116.2 million, and proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $3.7 million, were used to fund acquisition related payments of $484.9 million, purchases of treasury stock of $324.7 million, capital expenditures of $158.4 million, dividend payments of $96.8 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $53.7 million and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $4.4 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents including the impact of Translation of $196.0 million. In 2012, cash flow provided by operating activities of $674.7 million, net borrowings of $325.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $117.1 million, and proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $4.8 million, were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $380.0 million, acquisition-related payments of $251.5 million, capital expenditures of $129.1 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $117.8 million, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $5.2 million and dividend payments of $70.1 million, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents including the impact of Translation of $175.8 million. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,192.2 million and $942.5 million, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. In July 2013, the Company amended its revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to (1) reduce borrowing costs, (2) extend the maturity date to July 2018 and (3) increase aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $500.0 million, thereby increasing the Revolving Credit Facility to $1,500.0 million. At December 31, 2013, borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility were $927.3 million and $572.7 million, respectively. The interest rate on borrowings under the 20 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility was at a spread over LIBOR. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.75% Senior Notes due November 2014 (the “4.75% Senior Notes”) at 99.813% of their face value. Interest on the 4.75% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.75% Senior Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The 4.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.75% Senior Notes at December 31, 2013 was approximately $621.0 million based on recent bid prices. In January 2012, the Company issued $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the “4.00% Senior Notes”) at 99.746% of their face value. Net proceeds from the sale of the 4.00% Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the 4.00% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2012, to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 4.00% Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to November 1, 2021, a make-whole premium. The 4.00% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The fair value of the 4.00% Senior Notes at December 31, 2013 was approximately $491.0 million based on recent bid prices. In January 2014, the Company issued $750.0 million principal amount of unsecured 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Senior Notes”) at 99.846% of their face value. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2.55% Senior Notes to repay borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the 2.55% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 30 and July 30 of each year, commencing July 30, 2014, to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2.55% Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, and if redeemed prior to December 30, 2018, a make-whole premium. The 2.55% Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness (the 4.75% Senior Notes, the 4.00% Senior Notes and the 2.55% Senior Notes are collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes”). A subsidiary of the Company had entered into a Receivables Securitization Facility with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary could sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the “Receivables Securitization Facility”). The Company serviced, administered and collected the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Receivables Securitization Facility included certain covenants and provided for various events of termination. Transfers of receivables were reflected as debt issued in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors was accounted for as a secured borrowing and was included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as short-term debt as of December 31, 2012. Fees incurred in connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility are included in interest expense. Such fees were approximately $0.9 million, $1.0 million, and $1.6 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. On November 15, 2013, the Company terminated the Receivables Securitization Facility. In October 2013, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a financial institution (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million uncommitted and unsecured credit facility with the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR, which is renewable annually. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s Receivable Securitization Facility. At December 31, 2013, borrowings and availability under the Credit Agreement were $100.0 million and nil, respectively. The carrying value of borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Agreement approximated their fair value at December 31, 2013 due to their relative short-term maturities and market interest rates. The Company had $14.1 million of issued and unused letters of credit at December 31, 2013. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2014 will be approximately $180 to $200 million. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock. In July 2013, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.105 to $0.20 per share effective with the third quarter 2013 dividend. Total dividends declared during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $96.8 million, $67.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $96.8 million, $70.1 million and $10.3 21 Table of Contents million, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s credit facilities, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products or a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, and availability under its credit facilities will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. In January 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock during the two year period ending January 31, 2015 (the “2013 Stock Repurchase Program”). The price and timing of any such purchases under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program after December 31, 2013 will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. Through February 15, 2014, the Company has repurchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock under the 2013 Program for $120.3 million. These treasury shares will be retired by the Company and common stock and accumulated earnings will be reduced accordingly. At February 15, 2014, approximately 4.3 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the 2013 Program. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The Company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized by the Company’s facility in Sidney, New York, and others - the Richardson Hill Road landfill, the Route 8 landfill and the Sidney landfill. Actions at the Richardson Hill Road and Sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “Superfund” sites on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The Route 8 landfill was designated as a New York State Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site, with remedial actions taken pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 375-1 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations. In addition, the Company is currently performing monitoring activities at, and in proximity to, its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal sites. Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol Corporation from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the Sidney landfill, all as referred to above. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. The environmental investigation, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon information currently known by management about the Company’s manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters, that any such liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 22 Table of Contents Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2013-05, Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (“ASU 2013-05”), which clarifies preexisting guidance regarding the treatment of cumulative translation adjustments when a parent sells part or all of its investment in a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a significant effect on its financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2013-02”). The update requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present either on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 was effective prospectively for the Company for the first quarter of 2013. Because this standard only impacts presentation and disclosure requirements, its adoption did not have a significant effect on the Company’s financial statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $30.1 million, $25.2 million and $19.1 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 4.60% at December 31, 2013 and 3.75% at December 31, 2012. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately $20.0 million. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. As described above, the expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of 23 Table of Contents return of approximately 9%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 7%). As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the asset allocation was 65% and 62% with equity managers and 32% and 37% with fixed income managers and 3% and 1% in cash, respectively. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at December 31, 2013 and 2012 is 8.00%. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $23.3 million, $21.8 million and $22.8 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans decreased in 2013 to $179.5 million ($4.0 million of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2014 for unfunded foreign plans) from $246.6 million in 2012 primarily due to an increase of the discount rate assumption compared to 2012. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2014 of approximately $22.0 million, most of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.5 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 8% of consolidated sales in 2013), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2013, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test in accordance with ASU 2011-08, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Testing for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2011-08”), which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2012. Under this amendment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. 24 Table of Contents As of June 30, 2013, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2013, 2012, or 2011 in connection with its annual impairment test. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors (Note 9). Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2013, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $2.6 billion. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2013, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 2,132,874 $ 701,437 $ 1,725 $ 929,069 $ 500,643 Interest related to 4.75% Senior Notes 28,500 28,500 — — — Interest related to 4.00% Senior Notes 170,000 20,000 40,000 40,000 70,000 Operating leases 84,346 33,451 39,445 10,644 806 Purchase obligations 223,042 220,217 2,767 58 — Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations (2) 54,872 16,039 11,016 11,250 16,567 Total (3) $ 2,693,634 $ 1,019,644 $ 94,953 $ 991,021 $ 588,016 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Agreement from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Revolving Credit Facility, Credit Agreement and Receivables Securitization Facility in 2013 were $10.6 million. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. Additionally, the Company has excluded the expected interest payments on the 2.55% Senior Notes which were issued in January 2014 and are due in January 2019. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2.55% Senior Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company expects to make annual interest payments of approximately $19.1 million until maturity of the 2.55% Senior Notes. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $15.0 million in 2013. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $9.0 million was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2014. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2014 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2013, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $14.9 million recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. 25 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had a forward contract that effectively fixed a Hong Kong dollar denominated intercompany debt obligation of 604.7 million Hong Kong dollars into a fixed U.S. dollar denominated obligation expiring in November 2014 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loan, a forward contract that effectively fixed a Euro denominated intercompany debt obligation of 174.6 million Euros into a fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligation expiring in December 2014 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loan and two forward contracts that effectively fixed Great Britain Pound denominated intercompany debt obligations of 25.0 million Great Britain Pounds and 12.8 million Great Britain Pounds into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring in September 2014 and December 2014, respectively, concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. As of December 31, 2013, $1,034.1 million, or 48% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, were subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. The Company has $600.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes due November 2014 outstanding, which were issued at 99.813% of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. The Company has $500.0 million of unsecured Senior Notes due February 2022 outstanding, which were issued at 99.746% of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 4.00%. In January 2014, the Company issued $750.0 million principal amount of unsecured 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 at 99.846% of their face value which have which have a fixed interest rate at 2.55%. The Company used the proceeds from the 2.55% Senior Notes to repay borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility thus reducing its exposure to floating interest rates. Outstanding borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are subject to floating interest rates, primarily LIBOR. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.17%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2013 would have no material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2014, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change. 26 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:44.579110
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein (dollars in millions except per share data). Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensor and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2014, approximately 69% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Pursue broad diversification; · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. In 2014, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $5,345.5, $1,034.6 and $709.1, respectively, up 16%, 15% and 12%, respectively, from 2013. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, 16 Table of Contents repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2014, the Company generated operating cash flow of $880.9. Results of Operations The Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend, payable to stockholders of record as of October 2, 2014, which was paid on October 9, 2014. The share and per share information included herein has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented. The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.3 68.5 68.7 Acquisition-related expenses 0.2 0.2 — Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.1 11.9 12.0 Operating income 19.4 19.4 19.3 Interest expense (1.5 ) (1.4 ) (1.4 ) Other income, net 0.3 0.3 0.2 Income before income taxes 18.2 18.3 18.1 Provision for income taxes (4.8 ) (4.5 ) (5.1 ) Net income 13.4 13.8 13.0 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1 ) — (0.1 ) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.3 % 13.8 % 12.9 % 2014 Compared to 2013 Net sales were $5,345.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4,614.7 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 16% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 17% in 2014 in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 8% organically compared to 2013 ($4,992.6 in 2014 versus $4,269.0 in 2013). The sales growth was driven by increases in nearly all of our served markets with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program; partially offset by a small decrease in sales in the information technology and data communications equipment market. Sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $276.2) reflecting particular growth within the energy and heavy equipment markets driven by the impact of organic growth and acquisitions. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $271.2), driven primarily by ongoing ramp ups of new, high-technology programs as well as higher vehicle production volumes and acquisitions. Sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $112.4), primarily due to an increase in worldwide network build-outs. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $49.7) primarily due to increased demand resulting from higher production levels of next generation jetliners and acquisitions. Sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $46.6) primarily due to growth in smartphones and accessories. Sales to the military market increased slightly (approximately $3.5). This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the information technology and data communications equipment market (approximately $20.2) due to declining networking product sales partially offset by growth in storage and server products. Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 2% in 2014 in U.S. dollars and 3% in both local currencies and organically compared to 2013 ($352.9 in 2014 versus $345.7 in 2013) primarily due to growth in international markets. Cable Products and Solutions sales are primarily in the broadband communications market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2014 increased approximately 17% ($1,673.5 in 2014 versus $1,430.6 in 2013) compared to 2013. International sales for 2014 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($3,672.0 in 2014 versus $3,184.1 in 2013) compared to 2013 with particular strength in Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2014 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $3.1 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2013. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.7% in 2014 compared to 31.5% in 2013. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due to increased volume and cost reduction actions. 17 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses were $645.1 and $548.0 and represented approximately 12.1% and 11.9% of net sales for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 is partially due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent of net sales basis arising from the inclusion in 2014 of an acquisition in the interconnect product and assemblies segment completed late in 2013 that has higher selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent of net sales basis compared to the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.7 in 2014 primarily related to increases in employee related benefits, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 4.8% and 4.6% of net sales in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research and development expenses increased approximately $11.4 in 2014 reflecting increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.1% of net sales in 2014 and 2.2% of net sales in 2013. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $39.0 in 2014 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both 2014 and 2013. On a consolidated basis, operating income margin was 19.4% for 2014 and 2013 and included the impact of acquisition-related expenses discussed below. Operating margin in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment was 21.8% for both 2014 and 2013 reflecting higher gross profit margin offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense as described above. Operating margin in the Cable Products and Solutions segment decreased to 12.4% in 2014 from 13.4% in 2013, primarily as a result of market pricing and product mix. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $14.1 and $6.0 of acquisition-related expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. These expenses include amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog, professional fees, transaction-related fees, and other external expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, these expenses had the impact on net income of $10.2, or $0.04 per share, and $4.6, or $0.01 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, operating income margin in 2014 and 2013 was 19.6% for both years. Interest expense was $80.4 for 2014 compared to $63.6 for 2013. The increase is primarily attributable to higher average debt levels related to the Company’s stock repurchase program as well as acquisition activity. Other income, net, increased to $18.3 in 2014 compared to $13.4 in 2013, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.5% in 2014 and 24.6% in 2013. The 2013 tax rate reflects a decrease in tax expense of $11.3, or $0.03 per share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. The 2013 tax rate also reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisition-related expenses, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2014 and 2013 was 26.5% and 26.3%, respectively. The Company operates in the U.S. and numerous foreign taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2011 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was $19.2 the majority of which is included in Accrued pension benefit obligations and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3. 18 Table of Contents 2013 Compared to 2012 Net sales were $4,614.7 for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $4,292.1 for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 8% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 4% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts). Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 7% in 2013 in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 4% organically compared to 2012 ($4,269.0 in 2013 versus $3,987.3 in 2012). The sales growth was driven by increases in nearly all of our served markets with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $104.0), driven primarily by participation in new programs, higher vehicle volumes and acquisitions. Sales to the IT and data communications equipment market increased (approximately $57.7), primarily due to broad-based strength in servers, storage and network hardware. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $54.0) due to increased demand driven by higher levels of airplane production and new airplane platforms and acquisitions. Industrial market sales increased (approximately $42.9), primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $23.0), primarily due to an increase in worldwide network build-outs with particular strength in North America and Europe. Sales to the mobile devices market increased slightly (approximately $4.6). This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military market (approximately $9.8), primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties. Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 13% in 2013 in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies and were down 3% organically compared to 2012 ($345.7 in 2013 versus $304.8 in 2012). Increased sales levels were due to a 2012 acquisition which was partially offset by overall lower spending at cable operators. Cable Products and Solutions sales are primarily in the broadband communications market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2013 increased approximately 4% ($1,430.6 in 2013 versus $1,379.7 in 2012) compared to 2012. International sales for 2013 increased approximately 9% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($3,184.1 in 2013 versus $2,912.4 in 2012) compared to 2012 with particular strength in Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2013 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $15.4 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2012. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.5% in 2013 compared to 31.3% in 2012. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due primarily to increased volume and cost reduction actions. Operating margin in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment was 21.8% and 21.5% of sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Operating margin in the Cable Products and Solutions segment decreased to 13.4% in 2013 from 13.5% of sales in 2012, primarily as a result of market pricing and product mix. On a consolidated basis, operating income margin was 19.4%, up 10 basis points from 2012, which included the impact of acquisition-related expenses discussed below. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $6.0 and $2.0 of acquisition-related expenses in 2013 and 2012, respectively, in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. These expenses include professional fees, transaction-related fees and other external expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, these expenses had an impact on net income of $4.6, or $0.01 per share, and $2.0, or $0.01 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, operating income margin was 19.6% in 2013 compared to 19.3% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $548.1 and $512.9 in 2013 and 2012 and represented approximately 11.9% of net sales for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Administrative expenses increased approximately $9.9 in 2013 primarily related to increases in employee related benefits, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 4.6% and 4.7% of net sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Research and development expenses increased approximately $11.0 in 2013 reflecting increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% of net sales for both 2013 and 2012. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $14.3 in 2013 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both 2013 and 2012. Interest expense was $63.6 for 2013 compared to $59.6 for 2012. The increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels from the Company’s acquisitions and stock repurchase programs. Other income, net, was $13.4 for 2013 compared to $10.1 for 2012, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 24.6% in 2013 and 28.2% in 2012. The 2013 tax rate reflects a decrease in tax expense and the 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of $11.3, or $0.03 per diluted common 19 Table of Contents share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. Under U.S. GAAP, the benefit to the Company of $11.3 relating to the 2012 tax year was recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement; as such, between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, there is no net impact on the Company from an income statement perspective. The 2013 tax rate also reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisition-related expenses, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was 26.3% and 26.7%, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $880.9 for 2014 compared to $769.1 for 2013. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in the net components of working capital. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $769.1 for 2013 compared to $674.7 for 2012. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a net decrease in other long-term assets partially offset by a higher increase in components of working capital. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $18.9 in 2014 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $111.5, $51.6 and $10.0, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $66.8 and $87.3, respectively. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $26.3 in 2013 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $37.1, $8.0 and $18.4, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.9 and $30.2, respectively. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $8.9 in 2012 due primarily to increases in inventory and accounts receivable of $45.9 and $123.9, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.4 and $61.5, respectively. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2014 compared to 2013. Accounts receivable increased $122.7, to $1,123.7 resulting from higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $37.4, offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 71 and 70, respectively. Inventories increased $73.0, to $865.6, primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity and the impact of acquisitions of $32.8 offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 79 and 80, respectively. Other current assets increased $13.4 to $185.2, primarily due to increases in deferred tax assets of $14.0 and the impact of acquisitions. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $58.3 to $590.7 reflecting capital expenditures of $209.1 and net fixed assets from acquisitions of $8.6, partially offset by depreciation of $126.7, disposals of $7.6 and Translation. Goodwill increased $327.6 to $2,616.7 primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during 2014 offset by Translation. Intangibles and other long-term assets increased $126.6 primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from acquisitions in 2014. Accounts payable increased $68.5, to $618.4, primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels, the impact of acquisitions of $24.4 offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 57 and 56, respectively. Total accrued expenses increased $28.4 to $386.9, primarily due to increases in accrued salaries, accrued interest and the impact of acquisitions of $16.0 offset by Translation. Accrued pension benefit obligations and other long-term liabilities increased $124.6 to $371.2 due primarily to an increase in the projected benefit obligation relating to the Company’s pension plans as a result of a change in discount rate and mortality assumptions and an increase in deferred tax liabilities. In 2014, cash flow provided by operating activities of $880.9, net borrowings of $528.9 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $130.1 were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $539.4, acquisition related payments of $518.2, net capital expenditures of $203.5, dividend payments of $101.9, net purchases of short-term investments of $60.2 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.6, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $113.1. Translation had the impact of decreasing cash and cash equivalents by $31.0 in 2014. In 2013, cash flow provided by operating activities of $769.1, net borrowings of $418.2, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $116.2, and proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets of $3.7, were used to fund acquisition related payments of $484.9, purchases of treasury stock of 20 Table of Contents $324.7, capital expenditures of $158.4, dividend payments of $96.8, net purchases of short-term investments of $53.7 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $4.4, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents including the impact of Translation of $184.3. Translation had the impact of increasing cash and cash equivalents by $11.7 in 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,329.6 and $1,192.2, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. As a result, the Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company has a history of borrowing funds domestically and continues to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. In 2014, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% senior notes due January 2019, $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 1.55% senior notes due September 2017 and $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.125% senior notes due September 2021. The issuances of these senior notes were used to repay the $600.0 4.75% senior notes which matured during the year and to repay borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. In September 2014, the Company entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements. Amounts available under the commercial paper program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The commercial paper program was rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding under the commercial paper program at any time is $1,500.0 and commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was $671.0. The Company incurred fees and expenses related to the issuance of the commercial paper and senior notes of $11.1, which are capitalized and will be amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the debt. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s commercial paper program, credit facilities, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products or a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, and availability under its credit facilities will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2015 will be approximately $180.0 to $200.0. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock. In July 2013, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.0525 to $0.10 per share effective with the third quarter 2013 dividend and in July 2014 approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.10 to $0.125 per share effective with the third quarter 2014 dividend. Total dividends declared during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $140.6, $96.8 and $67.8, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $101.9, $96.8 and $70.1, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the senior notes, the revolving credit facilities, and commercial paper program. In January 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the two year period ending January 31, 2015 (the “2013 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its common stock for $539.4. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained 21 Table of Contents earnings were reduced accordingly. At December 31, 2014, the Company had repurchased all shares authorized under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 10 million shares of common stock during the two year period ending January 20, 2017 (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). The price and timing of any such purchases under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, titanium and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; certain rare earth metals used in sensors; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determine the transaction price(s); (4) allocate the transaction price(s) to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also requires advanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption not permitted. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2014-09. In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”), amending FASB Accounting Standards Subtopic 205-40 to provide guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term “substantial doubt,” (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that financial statements are 22 Table of Contents issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2014-15 and does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $22.4, $30.1 and $25.2 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted-average discount rate, mortality projections, rate increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 3.75% at December 31, 2014 and 4.60% at December 31, 2013. The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan. In 2014, the Company considered the updated mortality tables and improvement scales recently issued by the Society of Actuaries along with other mortality information available to develop updated mortality assumptions for the U.S. Plans. These updated mortality assumptions reflected increased life expectancies for plan participants. The decrease in the discount rate and the updated mortality assumptions resulted in an increase in the accrued benefit obligation for the U.S. Plans of approximately $80.0 at December 31,2014. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 9%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 7%). The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013 is 8.00%. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $23.8, $23.3 and $21.8 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans increased in 2014 to $279.3 ($5.0 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2015 for unfunded foreign plans) from $179.5 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and update in mortality projections. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2015 of approximately $22.0, most of which is related to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $3.8, $3.0 and $2.7 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. 23 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 7% of net sales in 2014), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each June 30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2014, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. As of June 30, 2014, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is greater than their carrying amounts. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2014, 2013 or 2012 in connection with its annual impairment test. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors (Note 7). Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $3.3 billion. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2014, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 2,673.9 $ 1.6 $ 375.5 $ 1,421.8 $ 875.0 Interest related to senior notes 337.4 56.6 113.3 84.1 83.4 Operating leases 99.6 35.5 40.4 17.0 6.7 Purchase obligations 247.9 219.7 27.1 1.1 — Accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations (2) 48.9 15.3 8.5 8.4 16.7 Total (3) $ 3,407.7 $ 328.7 $ 564.8 $ 1,532.4 $ 981.8 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, Credit Agreement and commercial paper program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, Credit Agreement and commercial paper program in 2014 were $7.5. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, however, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $15.0 in 2014. An anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately $9.7 was included in the above table related to the U.S. Plans for 2015. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2015 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2014, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $19.2 recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had five forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Euro, Great Britain Pound and U.S. dollar intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring 25 Table of Contents at various times throughout 2015 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2014 resulted in an asset of $11.0. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014 would not have a material effect on the value of hedge assets. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a proportion of fixed and variable rate debt. In 2014, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% senior notes due January 2019 at 99.846% of their face value, $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 1.55% senior notes due September 2017 at 99.898% of their face value and $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.125% senior notes due September 2021 at 99.912% of their face value. The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding $600.0 million 4.75% senior notes that were due in November 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Agreement, which reduced the Company’s interest expense. Throughout the year, the Company borrows under its Revolving Credit Facility, Credit Agreement and commercial paper program. Borrowings under these agreements either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, $671.0, or 25% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, related mainly to its commercial paper program, were subject to floating interest rates, primarily due to changes in LIBOR. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.38%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2014 would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2015, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly. 26 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:48.737484
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein and is presented in millions, except per share data. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensor and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2015, approximately 70% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company encounters competition in its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Pursue broad diversification; · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. In 2015, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $5,568.7, $1,104.7 and $763.5, respectively, up 4%, 7% and 8%, respectively, from 2014. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2015, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,030.5. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.1 68.3 68.5 Acquisition-related expenses 0.1 0.2 0.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.0 12.1 11.9 Operating income 19.8 19.4 19.4 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.5 ) (1.4 ) Other income, net 0.3 0.3 0.3 Income before income taxes 18.9 18.2 18.3 Provision for income taxes (5.0 ) (4.8 ) (4.5 ) Net income 13.9 13.4 13.8 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.2 ) (0.1 ) — Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.7 % 13.3 % 13.8 % 2015 Compared to 2014 Net sales were $5,568.7 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,345.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 5% in 2015 in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014 ($5,239.1 in 2015 versus $4,992.6 in 2014). The sales growth was driven by increases in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and information technology and data communications equipment markets, with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program; partially offset by decreases in sales in the mobile networks, commercial aerospace and military markets. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $190.9), driven both by acquisitions and an expansion of our products across a diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics. Sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $116.5) primarily due to growth in next generation laptops, mobile device accessories and production-related products. Sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $43.0) reflecting the benefit of acquisitions as well as growth in industrial battery and hybrid vehicle applications and growth in alternative energy applications, offset by significant declines in products sold into oil and gas exploration. Sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $17.6), primarily due to the growth in products for server, web and data center applications, partially offset by declines in storage-related applications. Sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $101.7), primarily due to a decrease in worldwide mobile network build-outs. Sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased (approximately $21.5), primarily due to decreases in commercial helicopter and business jet demand. Sales to the military market decreased slightly (approximately $3.8). Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, decreased 7% in 2015 in U.S. dollars and 2% in both local currencies and organically compared to 2014 ($329.6 in 2015 versus $352.9 in 2014) primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators and the effect of ongoing operator consolidations in the broadband market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2015 increased approximately 1% ($1,696.3 in 2015 versus $1,673.5 in 2014) compared to 2014. International sales for 2015 increased approximately 5% in U.S. dollars and approximately 10% in local currencies ($3,872.4 in 2015 versus $3,672.0 in 2014) compared to 2014 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $190.3 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2014. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.9% in 2015 compared to 31.7% in 2014. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $669.1 and $645.1 and represented approximately 12.0% and 12.1% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Administrative expenses increased approximately $9.6 in 2015 primarily related to increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in both 2015 and 2014. Research and development expenses increased approximately $9.9 in 2015 reflecting an overall increase in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% of net sales in 2015 and 17 Table of Contents 2.1% of net sales in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $4.5 in 2015 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales in 2015 and 5.1% of net sales in 2014. Operating income was $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015, compared to $1,034.6 or 19.4% of net sales in 2014. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income) related to professional fees and other external expenses for acquisitions that were closed and announced in 2015. Operating income for 2014 is net of $14.1 of acquisition-related expenses, which included professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed in 2014, as well as the amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog related to acquisitions that closed in 2013 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, these expenses had the impact on net income of $5.7, or $0.02 per share, and $10.2, or $0.04 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, operating income margin in 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 19.6%, respectively. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2015 was $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales, compared to $1,088.0 or 21.8% of net sales of 2014. This increase in operating income margin is driven primarily by the positive impact of higher gross profit margins as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, as described above. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 was $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales, compared to $43.7 or 12.4% of net sales for 2014. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily as a result of lower volumes. Interest expense was $68.3 for 2015 compared to $80.4 for 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to the benefit of lower average borrowing rates resulting from the commercial paper program that was initiated in late 2014, and a senior note issuance in the third quarter of 2014 which replaced a higher rate note maturity. This benefit more than offset the impact of higher average debt levels which resulted from the Company’s stock repurchase program as well as acquisition activity. Other income, net, decreased to $16.4 in 2015 compared to $18.3 in 2014, primarily related to lower interest income on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.6% in 2015 and 26.5% in 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisition-related expenses, the Company’s effective tax rate for both 2015 and 2014 was 26.5%. 2014 Compared to 2013 Net sales were $5,345.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4,614.7 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 16% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 93% of net sales) increased 17% in 2014 in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 8% organically compared to 2013 ($4,992.6 in 2014 versus $4,269.0 in 2013). The sales growth was driven by increases in nearly all of our served markets with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program; partially offset by a small decrease in sales in the information technology and data communications equipment market. Sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $276.2) reflecting particular growth within the energy and heavy equipment markets driven by the impact of organic growth and acquisitions. Sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $271.2), driven primarily by ongoing ramp ups of new, high-technology programs as well as higher vehicle production volumes and acquisitions. Sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $112.4), primarily due to an increase in worldwide network build-outs. Sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $49.7) primarily due to increased demand resulting from higher production levels of next generation jetliners and acquisitions. Sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $46.6) primarily due to growth in smartphones and accessories. Sales to the military market increased slightly (approximately $3.5). This was partially offset by reductions in sales to the information technology and data communications equipment market (approximately $20.2) due to declining networking product sales partially offset by growth in storage and server products. Sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 7% of net sales) increased 2% in 2014 in U.S. dollars and 3% in both local currencies and organically compared to 2013 ($352.9 in 2014 versus $345.7 in 2013) primarily due to growth in international markets. Cable Products and Solutions sales are primarily in the broadband communications market. Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2014 increased approximately 17% ($1,673.5 in 2014 versus $1,430.6 in 2013) compared to 2013. International sales for 2014 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies ($3,672.0 in 2014 versus $3,184.1 in 2013) compared to 2013 with particular strength in Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2014 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $3.1 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2013. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.7% in 2014 compared to 31.5% in 2013. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment due to increased volume and cost reduction actions. 18 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses were $645.1 and $548.0 and represented approximately 12.1% and 11.9% of net sales for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 2013 is partially due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent of net sales basis arising from the inclusion in 2014 of an acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed late in 2013 that has higher selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent of net sales basis compared to the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.7 in 2014 primarily related to increases in employee related benefits, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 4.8% and 4.6% of net sales in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research and development expenses increased approximately $11.4 in 2014 reflecting increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.1% of net sales in 2014 and 2.2% of net sales in 2013. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $39.0 in 2014 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both 2014 and 2013. On a consolidated basis, operating income margin was 19.4% for 2014 and 2013 and included the impact of acquisition-related expenses discussed below. Operating margin in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment was 21.8% for both 2014 and 2013 reflecting higher gross profit margin offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses as described above. Operating margin in the Cable Products and Solutions segment decreased to 12.4% in 2014 from 13.4% in 2013, primarily as a result of market pricing and product mix. As separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company incurred $14.1 and $6.0 of acquisition-related expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years. These expenses include amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog, professional fees, transaction-related fees, and other external expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, these expenses had the impact on net income of $10.2, or $0.04 per share, and $4.6, or $0.01 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, operating income margin in 2014 and 2013 was 19.6% for both years. Interest expense was $80.4 for 2014 compared to $63.6 for 2013. The increase is primarily attributable to higher average debt levels related to the Company’s stock repurchase program as well as acquisition activity. Other income, net, increased to $18.3 in 2014 compared to $13.4 in 2013, primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.5% in 2014 and 24.6% in 2013. The 2013 tax rate reflects a decrease in tax expense of $11.3, or $0.03 per share, resulting from the delay, by the U.S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012. The 2013 tax rate also reflects a reduction in tax expense of $3.6 for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain of the Company’s prior year tax returns. Excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisition-related expenses, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2014 and 2013 was 26.5% and 26.3%, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,030.5 for 2015 compared to $880.9 for 2014. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in net income and an overall decrease in the net components of working capital, compared to the increase in net working capital in 2014. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $880.9 for 2014 compared to $769.1 for 2013. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in the net components of working capital. The components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $46.9 in 2015 due primarily to decreases in other current assets of $47.7 and increases in accrued liabilities of $44.2, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $22.3 and $5.2, respectively, and decreases in accounts payable of $17.5. The components of working capital increased $18.9 in 2014 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $111.5, $51.6 and $10.0, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $66.8 and $87.3, respectively. The components of working capital increased $26.3 in 2013 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $37.1, $8.0 and $18.4, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.9 and $30.2, respectively. The following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2015 compared to 2014. Accounts receivable decreased $19.1 to $1,104.6 primarily due to the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 (“Translation”), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. 19 Table of Contents Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 71. Inventories decreased $13.8 to $851.8, primarily due to the impact of Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Inventory days at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 79. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $18.8 to $609.5 as a result of capital expenditures of $172.1 and acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $131.8, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $76.2 to $2,692.9 primarily as a result of three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment completed during 2015 offset by Translation. Intangibles and other long-term assets decreased $20.3 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets of $34.9 and Translation, partially offset by additional identifiable intangible assets of $20.0 resulting from acquisitions during 2015. Accounts payable decreased $30.6 to $587.8, primarily as a result of Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 54 and 57, respectively. In 2015, cash flow provided by operating activities of $1,030.5, net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $335.9, net borrowings of $153.6 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $80.6 were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $248.9, acquisition-related payments of $199.8, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $163.4, dividend payments of $159.3, and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.1, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $823.1. Translation had the impact of decreasing cash and cash equivalents by $54.8 in 2015. In 2014, cash flow provided by operating activities of $880.9, net borrowings of $528.9 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $130.1 were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $539.4, acquisition related payments of $518.2, net capital expenditures of $203.5, dividend payments of $101.9, net purchases of short-term investments of $60.2 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.6, which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $113.1. Translation had the impact of decreasing cash and cash equivalents by $31.0 in 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,760.4 and $1,329.6, respectively. The majority of these amounts are located outside of the U.S. The Company used approximately $1,179, net of cash acquired, of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund the FCI acquisition on January 8, 2016, as described below. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate the remainder of these funds. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. As a result, the Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company has a history of borrowing funds domestically and has had the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. In September 2014, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (“Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program at any time is $1,500.0 and commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 was $823.9. Additionally, in 2014, the Company issued $1,500.0 principal amount, in aggregate, of unsecured senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay the $600.0 4.75% notes which matured during the year and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. Fees and expenses related to the issuance of the commercial paper and senior notes in 2014 was $11.1 and are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the debt. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows: Principal Amount Interest Rate Maturity $375.0 1.55% September 2017 750.0 2.55 January 2019 375.0 3.125 September 2021 500.0 4.00 February 2022 20 Table of Contents The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to the date of maturity, a make-whole premium. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s Commercial Paper Program, credit facilities, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company’s products or a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial ratios. However, management believes that the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, and availability under its credit facilities will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as it did with the 2016 acquisition of FCI as discussed below. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2016 will be approximately $180.0 to $200.0. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of Common Stock. In July 2014, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.10 to $0.125 per share effective with the third quarter 2014 dividend and in July 2015, approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.125 to $0.14 per share effective with the third quarter 2015 dividend. Total dividends declared during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $163.7, $140.6 and $96.8, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $159.3, $101.9 and $96.8, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the senior notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Commercial Paper Program. In January 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the two year period ending January 31, 2015 (the “2013 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its common stock for $539.4. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. At December 31, 2014, the Company had repurchased all shares authorized under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 10 million shares of common stock during the two year period ending January 20, 2017 (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares of its common stock for $248.9. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. At January 31, 2016, approximately 5.5 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. In 2015, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $24.1, the majority of which was to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the plan assets. FCI Acquisition On January 8, 2016, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated July 17, 2015 and as amended on December 31, 2015, by and among the Company and Bain Capital, the Company acquired all of the share capital of FCI for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,179, net of cash acquired (subject to closing adjustments), which was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand that were held outside of the United States. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the FCI acquisition. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations 21 Table of Contents are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, titanium, steel and metal alloy products used for contacts, connector shells and cable; certain rare earth metals used in sensors; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in the communications related markets, this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and International Plans (the “Plans”) approximated $31.0, $22.4 and $30.1 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted-average discount rate, mortality projections, rate of increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 4.11% at December 31, 2015 and 3.75% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease in the accrued benefit obligation for the U.S. Plans of approximately $19.0 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the Company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations. The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 9%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 9%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 6%). The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the benefit obligation of the U.S. Plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is 8.00%. 22 Table of Contents The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $24.1, $23.8 and $23.3 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans decreased in 2015 to $266.0 ($3.7 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2016 for unfunded foreign plans) from $279.3 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in the discount rate. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the Plans in 2016 of approximately $22.0, most of which will be to the U.S. Plans. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $4.2, $3.8 and $3.0 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered, title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 6% of net sales in 2015), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - Annually, the Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s two reporting units. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2015, the Company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of July 1, rather than June 30, which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment. In 2014, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company had determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts. In 2015, the Company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment, and in the third quarter, the Company performed the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment. As part of the quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach. The Company believes this approach provides the best indicator of fair value, by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar 23 Table of Contents businesses within the industry. Significant estimates and assumptions were used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections, determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies, and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry. As part of our quantitative approach, the Company evaluated whether there were reasonably likely changes to management’s estimates and assumptions that would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment. As of July 1, 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the Company’s reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts, and therefore, no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2015, 2014 or 2013 in connection with its annual impairment assessment. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $3,699. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2015, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations (dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 2,826.8 $ 0.3 $ 1,201.9 $ 749.5 $ 875.1 Interest related to senior notes 280.9 56.7 107.5 65.0 51.7 Operating leases 118.4 36.9 46.1 22.5 12.9 Purchase obligations 198.0 186.5 11.4 0.1 — Accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations (2) 47.2 6.5 10.1 9.7 20.9 Total (3) $ 3,471.3 $ 286.9 $ 1,377.0 $ 846.8 $ 960.6 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program in 2015 were $6.2. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2016. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $15.0 in 2015 and anticipates making a similar voluntary contribution in 2016. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2016 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (3) As of December 31, 2015, the Company has non-current liabilities of approximately $20.6 recognized in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid. 25 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had six forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Euro, Great Britain Pound and Korean Won intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2017 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2015 resulted in a net asset of $3.3. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2015 would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. In 2014, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% senior notes due January 2019, $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 1.55% senior notes due September 2017 and $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.125% senior notes due September 2021. The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding $600.0 million 4.75% senior notes that were due in November 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility and credit facilities, which reduced the Company’s interest expense. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, $828.9, or 29% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, related mainly to its Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates, primarily due to changes in LIBOR. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 0.88%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2015 would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2016, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly. 26 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:51.048360
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share data) The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview General The Company is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2016, approximately 72% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Strategy The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. 19 Table of Contents The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Pursue broad diversification; · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. In 2016, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $6,286.4, $1,205.2 and $822.9, respectively, up 13%, 9% and 8%, respectively, from 2015. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, increased by 12% and 11%, respectively. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2016, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,077.6. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.5 68.1 68.3 Acquisition-related expenses 0.6 0.1 0.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.7 12.0 12.1 Operating income 19.2 19.8 19.4 Interest expense (1.1) (1.2) (1.5) Other income, net 0.1 0.3 0.3 Income before income taxes 18.2 18.9 18.2 Provision for income taxes (4.9) (5.0) (4.8) Net income 13.3 13.9 13.4 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.2) (0.2) (0.1) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 13.1 % 13.7 % 13.3 % 2016 Compared to 2015 Net sales were $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $5,568.7 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currencies and 2% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currencies and 2% organically in 2016, compared to 2015. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the information technology and data communications, industrial, automotive, mobile networks and military markets, with contributions from both the Company’s acquisitions as well as organic strength, partially offset by a decline in sales in the mobile devices market and a slight decline in the commercial aerospace market. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $404.0), reflecting the benefits of FCI and other acquisitions as well as growth in products for data centers, including server, networking and storage-related applications. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $183.9) reflecting the benefit of acquisitions including FCI as well as sales strength in hybrid bus and truck, factory automation and heavy equipment, which was partially offset by sales declines in products sold into oil and gas exploration and alternative energy applications. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $118.3), driven by both an expansion of our products across a diversified range of vehicles and new onboard electronics as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $114.9), primarily due to contributions from acquisitions including FCI as well as increased sales to 20 Table of Contents mobile network service providers and OEMs. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $24.0), driven primarily by increased sales into avionics packaging and military airframe applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased (approximately $158.8) primarily due to declining sales of products incorporated into tablets, smartphones and production-related products, partially offset by growth in sales of products incorporated into new wearable technologies. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly decreased (approximately $2.5) due to decreases in commercial helicopter and business jet demand which offset the growth associated with new airplane platforms. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 10% in U.S. dollars, 12% in constant currencies and 9% organically in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the sales increase in the broadband communications market and contributions from an acquisition made during the third quarter of 2016. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2016 2015 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 5,922.3 $ 5,239.1 13 % (1) % 14 % 12 % 2 % Cable Products and Solutions 364.1 329.6 10 % (2) % 12 % 3 % 9 % Consolidated $ 6,286.4 $ 5,568.7 13 % (1) % 14 % 12 % 2 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by translating current year net sales at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the U.S. in 2016 increased approximately 3% ($1,740.7 in 2016 versus $1,696.3 in 2015) compared to 2015. International sales in 2016 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($4,545.7 in 2016 versus $3,872.4 in 2015), 19% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to 2015 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $61.3 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2015. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.5% in 2016 compared to 31.9% in 2015. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions as well as the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had higher gross margins than the average of the Company. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016, compared to $669.1 or 12.0% of net sales for 2015. The increase is driven primarily by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which has higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased approximately $41.2 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2016 and 4.8% of net sales in 2015. Research and development expenses increased approximately $41.4 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and represented approximately 2.6% of net sales in 2016 and 2.2% of net sales in 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $46.5 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and an increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales in 2016 and 5.0% of net sales in 2015. Operating income was $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016, compared to $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which included external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the FCI acquisition, as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 21 Table of Contents of acquisition-related expenses, which included professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed and announced in 2015. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these expenses had an impact on net income of $33.1, or $0.11 per share, and $5.7, or $0.02 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,241.8 or 19.8% of net sales in 2016 and $1,110.4 or 19.9% in 2015. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2016 compared to 2015, relates to the decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2016 was $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales, compared to $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales in 2015. The slight decrease in operating income margin is driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the full year period. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 was $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales in 2015. The increase in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily as a result of strong operating execution on additional volume, along with the benefit from the favorable impact from commodities. The table below reconciles Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Operating Operating Operating Operating income margin income margin Reported (GAAP) $ 1,205.2 19.2 % $ 1,104.7 19.8 % Acquisition-related expenses 36.6 0.6 % 5.7 0.1 % Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,241.8 19.8 % $ 1,110.4 19.9 % Interest expense was $72.6 in 2016 compared to $68.3 in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the impact of higher average debt levels in 2016 which primarily resulted from the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs. Other income, net, decreased to $8.5 in 2016 compared to $16.4 in 2015, primarily related to lower interest income on lower cash equivalents and short-term investments, which resulted from the funding of the acquisition of FCI in January 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the United States. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 27.0% in 2016 and 26.6% in 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 included the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during each year, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 50 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2015 Compared to 2014 Net sales were $5,568.7 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5,345.5 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 3% organically in 2015, compared to 2014. The sales growth was driven by increases in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and information technology and data communications equipment markets, with contributions from both organic growth and the Company’s acquisition program; partially offset by decreases in sales in the mobile networks, commercial aerospace and military markets. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $190.9), driven both by acquisitions and an expansion of our products across a diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $116.5) primarily due to growth in next generation laptops, mobile device accessories and production-related products. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $43.0) reflecting the benefit of acquisitions as well as growth in industrial battery and hybrid vehicle applications and in alternative energy applications, offset by significant declines in products sold into oil and gas exploration. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $17.6), primarily due to the growth in products for server, web and data center applications, partially offset by declines in storage-related 22 Table of Contents applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $101.7), primarily due to a decrease in worldwide mobile network build-outs. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased (approximately $21.5), primarily due to decreases in commercial helicopter and business jet demand. Net sales to the military market decreased slightly (approximately $3.8). Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, decreased 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in both constant currencies and organically in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators and the effect of ongoing operator consolidations in the broadband market. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2015 2014 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 5,239.1 $ 4,992.6 5 % (3) % 8 % 5 % 3 % Cable Products and Solutions 329.6 352.9 (7) % (5) % (2) % 0 % (2) % Consolidated $ 5,568.7 $ 5,345.5 4 % (4) % 8 % 5 % 3 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements.

(4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the U.S. in 2015 increased approximately 1% ($1,696.3 in 2015 versus $1,673.5 in 2014) compared to 2014. International sales for 2015 increased approximately 5% in U.S. dollars and approximately 10% in constant currencies ($3,872.4 in 2015 versus $3,672.0 in 2014) compared to 2014 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $190.3 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2014. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.9% in 2015 compared to 31.7% in 2014. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $669.1 or 12.0% of net sales for 2015, compared to $645.1 or 12.1% of net sales for 2014. Administrative expenses increased approximately $9.6 in 2015 primarily related to increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in both 2015 and 2014. Research and development expenses increased approximately $9.9 in 2015 reflecting an overall increase in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% of net sales in 2015 and 2.1% of net sales in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $4.5 in 2015 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales in 2015 and 5.1% of net sales in 2014. Operating income was $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015, compared to $1,034.6 or 19.4% of net sales in 2014. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income) related to professional fees and other external expenses for acquisitions that were closed and announced in 2015. Operating income for 2014 includes $14.1 of acquisition-related expenses, which included professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed in 2014, as well as the amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog related to acquisitions that closed in 2013 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, these expenses had an impact on net income of $5.7, or $0.02 per share, and $10.2, or $0.04 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,110.4 or 19.9% of net sales in 2015 and $1,048.7 or 19.6% of net sales in 2014. The increase in Adjusted Operating 23 Table of Contents Margin in 2015 compared to 2014 relates to the increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2015 was $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales, compared to $1,088.0 or 21.8% of net sales in 2014. This increase in operating income margin is driven primarily by the positive impact of higher gross profit margins as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, as described above. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 was $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales, compared to $43.7 or 12.4% of net sales for 2014. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily as a result of lower volumes. The table below reconciles Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Operating Operating Operating Operating income margin income margin Reported (GAAP) $ 1,104.7 19.8 % $ 1,034.6 19.4 % Acquisition-related expenses 5.7 0.1 % 14.1 0.2 % Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,110.4 19.9 % $ 1,048.7 19.6 % Interest expense was $68.3 for 2015 compared to $80.4 for 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to the benefit of lower average borrowing rates resulting from the commercial paper program that was initiated in late 2014, and a senior note issuance in the third quarter of 2014 which replaced a higher rate note maturity. This benefit more than offset the impact of higher average debt levels which resulted from the Company’s stock buyback program as well as acquisition activity. Other income, net, decreased to $16.4 in 2015 compared to $18.3 in 2014, primarily related to lower interest income on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.6% in 2015 and 26.5% in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 included the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during each year, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 10 basis points. Acquisition-related expenses incurred during 2014 did not have an impact on the effective tax rate for that year. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,173.2 and $1,760.4, respectively. On January 8, 2016, the Company used approximately $1,178.6 of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, net of cash acquired, to fund the FCI acquisition. The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2016 was located outside of the U.S. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate any of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, but rather to permanently reinvest such funds outside the U.S. However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes. Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,077.6 $ 1,030.5 $ 880.9 Net cash used in investing activities (1,612.7) (27.3) (781.9) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (133.5) (180.1) 14.1 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34.0) (54.8) (31.0) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (702.6) $ 768.3 $ 82.1 24 Table of Contents Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities has been one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,077.6 for 2016 compared to $1,030.5 for 2015. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to an increase in net income, higher non-cash charges resulting from the increase in depreciation and amortization related to the FCI acquisition, and a higher decrease in the net components of working capital, which were partially offset by a higher usage of cash related to the change in long-term assets and liabilities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,030.5 for 2015 compared to $880.9 for 2014. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in net income and an overall decrease in the net components of working capital, compared to the increase in net working capital in 2014. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively. In 2015, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $46.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to decreases in other current assets of $47.7 and increases in accrued liabilities of $44.2, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $22.3 and $5.2, respectively, and decreases in accounts payable of $17.5. In 2014, the components of working capital increased $18.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $111.5, $51.6 and $10.0, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $66.8 and $87.3, respectively. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased $244.7 to $1,349.3 primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions as well as an increase in sales volume, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 73 and 71, respectively. Inventories increased $77.1 to $928.9, primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 76 and 79, respectively. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $101.9 to $711.4, primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, as well as capital expenditures of $190.8, partially offset by depreciation of $157.8, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $985.9 to $3,678.8 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized during the year related to four acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, including FCI, and one acquisition in the Cable Products and Solutions segment, partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $211.3 to $517.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $263.0 recognized related to the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $54.6 and Translation. Accounts payable increased $90.4 to $678.2, primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 55 and 54, respectively. Total accrued expenses increased $161.5 to $581.8, primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $25.9 to $288.4 primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI acquisition. Other long-term liabilities increased $120.6 to $216.5 primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, specifically related to an increase in contingent tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. In 2016, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $26.2, the majority of which was to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the plan assets. Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures (purchases of land and depreciable assets), proceeds from disposals of land and depreciable assets, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. 25 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $1,612.7 in 2016, compared to $27.3 in 2015 and $781.9 in 2014. In 2016, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions during the year, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7 and net purchases of short-term investments of $123.9. In 2015, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $199.8 in cash to fund acquisitions during the year and capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $163.4, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $335.9. In 2014, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $518.2 in cash to fund acquisitions during the year, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $203.5 and net purchases of short-term investments of $60.2. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits, dividend payments and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was $133.5 in 2016, compared to $180.1 in 2015. In 2016, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of $183.2. In 2015, cash used in financing activities of $180.1 was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $248.9, dividend payments of $159.3 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.1, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $153.6 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $80.6. In 2014, cash provided by financing activities of $14.1 was driven primarily by increased net borrowings of $540.0 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $130.1, partially offset by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $539.4, dividend payments of $101.9, payments of costs related to debt financing of $11.1 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.6. The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company has been, and continues to be, able to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper program, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. On March 1, 2016, the Company replaced its $1,500.0 unsecured credit facility with a new $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures March 2021, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2014, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (“Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. Effective April 1, 2016, the maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper Program was increased by $500.0 from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0. The amount of commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was $1,018.9. Additionally, in 2014, the Company issued three separate unsecured senior notes with an aggregate $1,500.0 principal amount, the proceeds of which were used to repay the $600.0 4.75% notes which matured during the year and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. Fees and expenses related to the issuance of the Revolving Credit Facility in 2016 was $3.0. The fees and expenses related to the issuance of the commercial paper and senior notes in 2014 was $11.1. Such issuance fees and expenses are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the debt. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. 26 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2016, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 375.0 1.55 % September 2017 750.0 2.55 % January 2019 375.0 3.125 % September 2021 500.0 4.00 % February 2022 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to the date of maturity, a make-whole premium. The 1.55% Senior Notes are due in September 2017 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt. In January 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 31, 2015 (the “2013 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its common stock for $539.4. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. At December 31, 2014, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 10 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased 5.5 million and 4.5 million shares of its common stock for $325.8 and $248.9, respectively. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). As of February 10, 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock for $213.9 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of Common Stock. In the third quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.125 to $0.14 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2015, and in October 2016, approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.14 to $0.16 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total dividends declared during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $178.8, $163.7 and $140.6, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $172.7, $159.3 and $101.9, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Commercial Paper Program. Liquidity and Cash Requirements The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from 27 Table of Contents operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months, including the repayment of its 1.55% Senior Notes due in September 2017. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as it did with the 2016 acquisition of FCI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of approximately $200.0 to $240.0. FCI Acquisition On January 8, 2016, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated July 17, 2015 and as amended on December 31, 2015, the Company acquired all of the share capital of FCI for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,178.6, net of cash acquired, which was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand that were held outside of the United States. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the FCI acquisition. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, certain discrete tax items and refinancing-related costs 28 Table of Contents that may arise during such periods. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are included in “Results of Operations”: · Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income). · Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. · Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior years and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. In addition, the following two non-GAAP financial measures, defined below, are reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in Part II, Item 6 herein, for each of the years presented therein. · Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol is defined as Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their related tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their related tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol, as defined above, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Pensions The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and 29 Table of Contents compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans”). The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and the International Plans (together, the “Plans”) approximated $24.2, $31.0 and $22.4 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including a weighted average discount rate, mortality projections, rate of increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 3.93% and 4.11% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $10.7 at December 31, 2016. The weighted average discount rate for the International Plans was 2.28% and 3.14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the discount rate for the International Plans did not have a material impact on the benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the Company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations. The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as consideration of long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 8.5%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 6.0%). The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the U.S. Plans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 7.75% and 8.00%, respectively. The Company's expected weighted average long-term rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the International Plans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 4.29% and 5.47%, respectively. The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $26.2, $24.1 and $23.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2016 to $290.9 ($4.0 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2017 for unfunded foreign plans) from $266.0 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make aggregate cash contributions to the Plans in 2017 of approximately $25.0, the majority of which will be to the U.S. Plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets. The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions to its U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $5.0, $4.2 and $3.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered, title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 6% of net sales in 2016), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. The Company has not recorded any significant impairments. Goodwill - The Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2015, the Company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of July 1, rather than June 30, which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment. In 2016, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors, which include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit’s carrying value is less than its fair value. As of July 1, 2016, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts. In 2015, the Company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment. As part of the quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach. The Company believed this approach provided the best indicator of fair value, by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar businesses within the industry. Significant estimates and assumptions were used in the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections, determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies, and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from 31 Table of Contents comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry. As part of our quantitative approach, the Company evaluated whether it was reasonably likely that changes to management’s estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment. As of July 1, 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the Company’s reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts, and therefore, no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2016, 2015 or 2014 in connection with its annual impairment assessment. Acquisitions - The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified. The Company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $4,182.5. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. 32 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2016, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt (1) $ 3,023.0 $ 375.7 $ 750.1 $ 1,396.9 $ 500.3 Interest related to senior notes 224.3 56.7 84.2 63.4 20.0 Operating leases 129.2 42.4 53.9 20.5 12.4 Purchase obligations (2) 255.5 219.9 35.0 0.6 — Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (3) 59.7 7.9 12.0 12.2 27.6 Total (4) $ 3,691.7 $ 702.6 $ 935.2 $ 1,493.6 $ 560.3 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, combined, in 2016 were $10.1. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including raw materials and components to be used in production. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2017. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $15.0 in 2016 and anticipates making a similar voluntary contribution in 2017. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2017 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As of December 31, 2016, the Company has recorded liabilities of approximately $138.7 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had four forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Euro, Great Britain Pound and Korean Won intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2017 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2016 resulted in a net asset of $8.4. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. In 2014, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% senior notes due January 2019, $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 1.55% senior notes due September 2017 and $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.125% senior notes due September 2021. The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding $600.0 million 4.75% senior notes that were due in November 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility and credit facilities. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR and any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, $1,024.4, or 34%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings related mainly to its Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s average floating rate on such borrowings was 1.06%. A 10% change in this interest rate at December 31, 2016 and 2015 would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly. 34 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:56.236531

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share data) The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview General The Company is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2017, approximately 72% of the Company’s sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Strategy The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. 21 Table of Contents The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Pursue broad diversification; · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. In 2017, the Company reported net sales and operating income of $7,011.3 and $1,427.6, respectively, up 12% and 18%, respectively, from 2016. The Company also reported net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $650.5, down 21% from 2016, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which resulted in a provisional income tax charge of $398.5 in 2017 as discussed in more detail below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the impact of the acquisition-related expenses incurred in the respective periods, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption of the new stock-based compensation standard. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, both increased by 15% in 2017. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2017, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,144.2. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (“Tax Act Charge”) that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 7, the three components of the Tax Act Charge are provisional amounts recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”). SAB 118 addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act’s enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company has not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. The Company will analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, as well as refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. The Company will complete its accounting in 2018 once the Company has obtained, prepared and fully analyzed all the necessary information. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Tax Act. For a discussion of certain risks associated with changes to fiscal and tax policies including the Tax Act, refer to the risk factor titled “Changes in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results” in Part I, Item 1A herein. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.1 67.5 68.1 Acquisition-related expenses — 0.6 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.5 12.7 12.0 Operating income 20.4 19.2 19.8 Interest expense (1.3) (1.1) (1.2) Other income, net 0.2 0.1 0.3 Income before income taxes 19.3 18.2 18.9 Provision for income taxes (9.9) (4.9) (5.0) Net income 9.4 13.3 13.9 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1) (0.2) (0.2) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 9.3 % 13.1 % 13.7 % 2017 Compared to 2016 Net sales were $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 9% organically in 2017, compared to 2016. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, mobile devices, military and commercial aerospace markets, with contributions from both organic strength as well as from the Company’s acquisitions, partially offset by a slight decline in sales in the mobile networks market. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $244.4), reflecting sales strength in heavy equipment, industrial instrumentation, oil and gas, and factory automation as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $177.0), driven by growth and expansion in all regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $115.0), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $101.1) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $77.8), driven by broad strength across substantially all segments of the market including increased sales into military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly increased (approximately $9.9) primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions as well as strength in large passenger planes, partially offset by continued weakness in demand for business jets and helicopters. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $20.3), primarily due to reduced overall capital spending by mobile operators. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in constant currencies in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016. 23 Table of Contents The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2017 2016 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 6,606.9 $ 5,922.3 12 % — % 12 % 3 % 9 % Cable Products and Solutions 404.4 364.1 11 % 1 % 10 % 9 % 1 % Consolidated $ 7,011.3 $ 6,286.4 12 % — % 12 % 4 % 8 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by translating current year net sales at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2017 increased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,978.4 in 2017 versus $1,740.7 in 2016) and 8% organically, compared to 2016. International sales in 2017 increased approximately 11% in U.S. dollars ($5,032.9 in 2017 versus $4,545.7 in 2016), 10% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to 2016 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2017 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $13.1 compared to 2016. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.9% in 2017 compared to 32.5% in 2016. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and strong operational execution. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017, compared to $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016. Administrative expenses increased approximately $28.9 in 2017 primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2017 and 4.9% of net sales in 2016. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.6 in 2017 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2017 and 2.6% of net sales in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $23.6 in 2017 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2017 and 5.1% of net sales in 2016. Operating income was $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017, compared to $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016. Operating income for 2017 includes $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses, related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte. Ltd. (“FCI”), as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,431.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017 and $1,241.8 or 19.8% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2017 compared to 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017 was $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales, compared to $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales in 2016. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the higher gross profit margin as discussed above. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 was $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales, compared to $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs. 24 Table of Contents Interest expense was $92.3 in 2017 compared to $72.6 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels, which resulted from the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs, as well as higher average interest rates partially driven by the senior note issuances in April 2017. Other income, net, increased to $17.1 in 2017 compared to $8.5 in 2016. The increase is primarily related to higher interest income on higher cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 51.1% in 2017 and 27.0% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption of the new stock-based compensation standard in 2017 (the adoption of ASU 2016-09 is discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 26.5% for both 2017 and 2016, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017, compared to $822.9 and $2.61, respectively, for 2016. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017, compared to $856.0 and $2.72, respectively, for 2016. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 1,427.6 20.4 % $ 650.5 51.1 % $ 2.06 $ 1,205.2 19.2 % $ 822.9 27.0 % $ 2.61 Acquisition-related expenses 4.0 - 3.7 - 0.01 36.6 0.6 33.1 (0.5) 0.11 Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation - - (66.6) 4.9 (0.21) - - - - - Tax Act Charge - - 398.5 (29.5) 1.26 - - - - - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,431.6 20.4 % $ 986.1 26.5 % $ 3.12 $ 1,241.8 19.8 % $ 856.0 26.5 % $ 2.72 (1) While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered GAAP measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the Reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP measure. 2016 Compared to 2015 Net sales were $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $5,568.7 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currencies and 2% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currencies and 2% organically in 2016, compared to 2015. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the information technology and data communications, industrial, automotive, mobile networks and military markets, with contributions from both the Company’s acquisitions as well as organic strength, partially offset by a decline in sales in the mobile devices market and a slight decline in the commercial aerospace market. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $404.0), reflecting the benefits of FCI and other acquisitions as well as growth in products for data centers, including server, networking and storage-related applications. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $183.9) reflecting the benefit of acquisitions including FCI as well as sales strength in hybrid bus and truck, factory automation and heavy equipment, which was partially offset by sales declines in 25 Table of Contents products sold into oil and gas exploration and alternative energy applications. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $118.3), driven by both an expansion of our products across a diversified range of vehicles and new onboard electronics as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $114.9), primarily due to contributions from acquisitions including FCI as well as increased sales to mobile network service providers and original equipment manufacturers. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $24.0), driven primarily by increased sales into avionics packaging and military airframe applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased (approximately $158.8) primarily due to declining sales of products incorporated into tablets, smartphones and production-related products, partially offset by growth in sales of products incorporated into new wearable technologies. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly decreased (approximately $2.5) due to decreases in commercial helicopter and business jet demand which offset the growth associated with new airplane platforms. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 10% in U.S. dollars, 12% in constant currencies and 9% organically in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the sales increase in the broadband communications market and contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2016 2015 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 5,922.3 $ 5,239.1 13 % (1) % 14 % 12 % 2 % Cable Products and Solutions 364.1 329.6 10 % (2) % 12 % 3 % 9 % Consolidated $ 6,286.4 $ 5,568.7 13 % (1) % 14 % 12 % 2 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by translating current year net sales at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the U.S. in 2016 increased approximately 3% in U.S. dollars ($1,740.7 in 2016 versus $1,696.3 in 2015) compared to 2015. International sales in 2016 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($4,545.7 in 2016 versus $3,872.4 in 2015), 19% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to 2015 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $61.3 compared to 2015. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.5% in 2016 compared to 31.9% in 2015. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions as well as the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had higher gross margins than the average of the Company. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016, compared to $669.1 or 12.0% of net sales for 2015. The increase is driven primarily by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which has higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased approximately $41.2 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2016 and 4.8% of net sales in 2015. Research and development expenses increased approximately $41.4 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and represented approximately 2.6% of net sales in 2016 and 2.2% of net sales in 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $46.5 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and an increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales in 2016 and 5.0% of net sales in 2015. 26 Table of Contents Operating income was $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016, compared to $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which included external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the FCI acquisition, as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed and announced in 2015. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these expenses had an impact on net income of $33.1, or $0.11 per share, and $5.7, or $0.02 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,241.8 or 19.8% of net sales in 2016 and $1,110.4 or 19.9% in 2015. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2016 compared to 2015, relates to the decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2016 was $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales, compared to $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales in 2015. The slight decrease in operating income margin is driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the full year period. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 was $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales in 2015. The increase in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily as a result of strong operating execution on additional volume, along with the benefit from the favorable impact from commodities. Interest expense was $72.6 in 2016 compared to $68.3 in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the impact of higher average debt levels in 2016 which primarily resulted from the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs. Other income, net, decreased to $8.5 in 2016 compared to $16.4 in 2015, primarily related to lower interest income on lower cash equivalents and short-term investments, which resulted from the funding of the acquisition of FCI in January 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the United States. Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 27.0% in 2016 and 26.6% in 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 included the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during each year. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 26.5% for both 2016 and 2015, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS was $822.9 and $2.61, respectively, for 2016, compared to $763.5 and $2.41, respectively, for 2015. Excluding the effect of the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $856.0 and $2.72, respectively, for 2016, compared to $769.2 and $2.43, respectively, for 2015. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 1,205.2 19.2 % $ 822.9 27.0 % $ 2.61 $ 1,104.7 19.8 % $ 763.5 26.6 % $ 2.41 Acquisition-related expenses 36.6 0.6 33.1 (0.5) 0.11 5.7 0.1 5.7 (0.1) 0.02 Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,241.8 19.8 % $ 856.0 26.5 % $ 2.72 $ 1,110.4 19.9 % $ 769.2 26.5 % $ 2.43 (1) While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered GAAP measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the Reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP measure. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,753.7 and $1,173.2, respectively. The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2017 is located outside of the United States. The Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States significantly reduces the future tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. As a result of this change, the Company plans to repatriate a significant portion of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in 2018. Additionally, in connection with the Tax Act, the Company recorded a provisional charge for the foreign and U.S. state and local tax cost related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, due to our intention to repatriate such foreign earnings over time. Such taxes will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Tax Act also resulted in a Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which we will pay, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, over the next eight years starting in 2018. The Company does not believe that these future tax payments will have a significant impact on its liquidity or capital resources. Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,144.2 $ 1,077.6 $ 1,030.5 Net cash used in investing activities (380.2) (1,612.7) (27.3) Net cash used in financing activities (140.1) (133.5) (180.1) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 60.6 (34.0) (54.8) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 684.5 $ (702.6) $ 768.3 Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities has been one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,144.2 for 2017 compared to $1,077.6 for 2016. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net income (excluding the effects of the non-cash Tax Act Charge of $398.5), which more than offset a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,077.6 for 2016 compared to $1,030.5 for 2015. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to an increase in net income, higher non-cash charges resulting from the increase in depreciation and amortization related to the FCI acquisition, and a higher decrease in the net components of working capital, which were partially offset by a higher usage of cash related to the change in long-term assets and liabilities. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively. In 2015, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $46.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to decreases in other current assets of $47.7 and increases in accrued liabilities of $44.2, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $22.3 and $5.2, respectively, and a decrease in accounts payable of $17.5. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased $249.3 to $1,598.6 primarily due to increased sales volumes, the impact of our 2017 acquisitions and the effect of translation from 28 Table of Contents exchange rate changes at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $178.0 to $1,106.9, primarily to support expected future sales levels, along with the impact of the 2017 acquisitions and Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 76 days. Other current assets increased $57.0 to $196.8 primarily due to increases in other receivables and prepaid expenses. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $105.4 to $816.8, primarily due to capital expenditures of $226.6 as well as Translation and the impact of 2017 acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $173.0 and disposals. Goodwill increased $363.8 to $4,042.6 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to five acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017, as well as Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $28.8 to $488.5 primarily as a result of the amortization of $48.6 on intangible assets, partially offset by the identifiable intangible assets of $13.3 recognized related to 2017 acquisitions and Translation. Accounts payable increased $197.4 to $875.6, primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity related to higher sales levels as well as Translation and the impact of 2017 acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 60 and 55, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $120.9 to $702.7, primarily as a result of an increase in accrued wages and salaries and employee-related benefits as well as an increase of approximately $63.1 related to the Tax Act Charge. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased $351.1 to $567.6, primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $335.4 recorded in 2017 related to the Tax Act Charge. In 2017, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) of approximately $22.5, the majority of which was to its defined benefit pension plans in the United States (“U.S. Plans”). The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and the Company’s funding intentions, it will make aggregate cash contributions to the Plans in 2018 of approximately $90.0, of which approximately $80.0 represents voluntary contributions made in January 2018 to substantially fund the U.S. Plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the plan assets. In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2017 is primarily related to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flow) as described above, which more than offset the increase in capital expenditures. 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,144.2 $ 1,077.6 $ 1,030.5 Capital expenditures (GAAP) (226.6) (190.8) (172.1) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ 917.6 $ 886.8 $ 858.4 Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $380.2 in 2017, compared to $1,612.7 in 2016 and $27.3 in 2015. In 2017, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 in cash to fund acquisitions and $222.5 for capital expenditures (net of disposals), partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $107.8. In 2016, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7, and net purchases of short-term investments of $123.9. In 2015, cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $199.8 in cash to fund acquisitions and $163.4 for capital expenditures (net of disposals), partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $335.9. 29 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was $140.1 in 2017, compared to $133.5 in 2016 and $180.1 in 2015. In 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $618.0, repayment of the 1.55% Senior Notes of $375.0, dividend payments of $205.0, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.4 and payments of costs related to the issuances of our two new series of senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by net cash proceeds from both the issuance of our two new series of senior notes and increased net borrowings under the commercial paper program of $903.4 combined, as well as the exercise of stock options of $184.1. In 2016, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of $183.2. In 2015, cash used in financing activities of $180.1 was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $248.9, dividend payments of $159.3 and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.1, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $153.6 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $80.6. The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company has been, and continues to be, able to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper program, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. On March 1, 2016, the Company replaced its $1,500.0 unsecured credit facility with a new $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures March 2021, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements. In April 2016, the maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time was increased by $500.0 from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0 under the Commercial Paper Program. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount of commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was $1,175.4. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 750.0 2.55 % January 2019 400.0 2.20 % April 2020 375.0 3.125 % September 2021 500.0 4.00 % February 2022 350.0 3.20 % April 2024 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. On April 5, 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 (the “2020 Senior Notes”) 30 Table of Contents and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024 (the “2024 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the “Notes”). In 2017, the Company incurred approximately $5.2 of costs related to the issuances of the Notes, which are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the debt. In September 2017, the Company used the net proceeds from the Notes to repay all of its outstanding $375.0 principal amount of 1.55% Senior Notes that were due September 15, 2017, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt. On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and Common Stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. From January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.1 million additional shares of Common Stock for $105.5, leaving approximately $276.5 available to purchase under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. In January 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 10 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased 5.5 million and 4.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $325.8 and $248.9, respectively. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and Common Stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015 First Quarter $ 0.16 $ 0.14 $ 0.125 Second Quarter 0.16 0.14 0.125 Third Quarter 0.19 0.14 0.14 Fourth Quarter 0.19 0.16 0.14 Dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Dividends declared $ 213.7 $ 178.8 $ 163.7 Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year) 205.0 172.7 159.3 Liquidity and Cash Requirements The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Notes”). 31 Table of Contents The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), and payments associated with the Transition Tax which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018 and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings as discussed above. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Commercial Paper Program. The Company also expects to use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as it did with the 2016 acquisition of FCI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2018 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales. FCI Acquisition On January 8, 2016, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated July 17, 2015 as amended on December 31, 2015, the Company acquired all of the share capital of FCI for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,178.6, net of cash acquired, which was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand that were held outside of the United States. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the FCI acquisition. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to 32 Table of Contents the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the Tax Act Charge and (ii) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation that may arise during such periods. As a result of the Tax Act’s reduction of a substantial portion of the future tax benefits of the Company’s stock option program as well as 2017 being the first year in which these excess tax benefits were reflected in income under U.S. GAAP, the Company has excluded and will continue to exclude the excess tax benefit of stock option exercises in the presentation of its adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: · Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined above, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. · Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income). · Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. · Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. · Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange 33 Table of Contents rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior years and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Pensions The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2017 to $256.9 ($4.4 of which represents the expected benefit payments to be made during 2018 primarily for unfunded foreign plans, as included in other accrued expenses) from $277.0 in 2016 primarily due to higher returns on plan assets realized in 2017, partly offset by the impact of lower discount rates on our projected benefit obligation. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and the Company’s funding intentions, it will make aggregate cash contributions to the Plans in 2018 of approximately $90.0, of which approximately $80.0 represents voluntary contributions made in January 2018 to substantially fund the U.S. Plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered, title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, provided the earnings process is complete and revenue is measurable. Such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communications market (approximately 6% of net sales in 2017), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 34 Table of Contents Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or net realizable value. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, evaluates the realizability of inventories and adjusts the carrying value as necessary based on forecasted product demand. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly. Goodwill - The Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2017 and 2016, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors, which include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is greater than its respective carrying amount. As of July 1, 2017 and 2016, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2017, 2016 or 2015 in connection with its annual impairment assessment. Acquisitions - The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified. The Company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates. Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $492.8, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. The amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated would not be material. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax 35 Table of Contents charge related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also includes a global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") provision, which as currently interpreted by the Company, requires a tax on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost if incurred, rather than recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. Other provisions of the Tax Act that impact future tax years continue to be assessed. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional income tax charges as a result of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act’s enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company has not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. The Company will analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, as well as refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare these provisional amounts. The Company will complete its accounting in 2018 once the Company has obtained, prepared, and fully analyzed all the necessary information. We will record any necessary adjustments in the period in which such adjustments are identified. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Tax Act. 36 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2017, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt (1) $ 3,555.5 $ 1.1 $ 1,151.7 $ 2,051.4 $ 351.3 Interest related to senior notes (1) 252.4 70.9 100.6 64.1 16.8 Operating leases 161.2 53.2 61.0 25.7 21.3 Purchase obligations (2) 345.6 286.9 56.2 2.4 0.1 Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (3) 69.0 9.1 14.7 15.4 29.8 Transition tax (Tax Act) (4) 185.8 14.9 29.7 29.7 111.5 Total (5) $ 4,569.5 $ 436.1 $ 1,413.9 $ 2,188.7 $ 530.8 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, combined, in 2017 were approximately $15.2. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans and the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2017. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $16.5 in 2017, and in January 2018, the Company also made voluntary contributions of approximately $80.0 to substantially fund the U.S. Plans, which is excluded from the above table. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2018 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax charge, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions and included in the table above, represents our current provisional charge based on certain assumptions made upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Act. In 2018, the Company will analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, as well as refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare this provisional amount. As permitted under the Tax Act, this income tax charge will be paid over the next eight years starting in 2018. The table above excludes the provisional charge recorded in 2017 related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, since that portion of the charge is not due until the Company repatriates such earnings. (5) As of December 31, 2017, the Company has recorded liabilities of approximately $162.8 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (dollars in millions) The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had six forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Euro, Great Britain Pound and Korean Won intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2018 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2017 resulted in a net asset of $2.3. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. In April 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% senior notes due April 2020 and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% senior notes due April 2024. The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding 1.55% senior notes of $375.0 that was due in September 2017 as well as for general corporate purposes. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, $1,182.0, or 33%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, which related mainly to its Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s average floating rate on such borrowings was 1.71% and 1.06%, respectively. A 10% change in this interest rate at December 31, 2017 and 2016 would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly. 38 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:56.901853
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted) The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meanings as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview General The Company is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2018, approximately 73% of the Company’s sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are: · information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications; · a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and · commercial aerospace and military applications. The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Strategy The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas. 23 Table of Contents The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors: · Pursue broad diversification; · Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions; · Expand global presence; · Control costs; · Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and · Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management. In 2018, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $8,202.0, $1,686.9 and $1,205.0, respectively, up 17%, 18% and 85%, respectively, from 2017. In 2018, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the recognition of excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. In 2017, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 which resulted in a provisional income tax charge of $398.5 as discussed in more detail below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the impact of the acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 recognized from stock option exercises. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 6 and Item 7 herein, increased by 18% and 19%, respectively, in 2018. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2018, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,112.7. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (“Tax Act Charge”) that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 7, the three components of the Tax Act Charge were provisional amounts recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”). SAB 118, which is now codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act’s enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.6 67.1 67.5 Acquisition-related expenses 0.1 — 0.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.7 12.5 12.7 Operating income 20.6 20.4 19.2 Interest expense (1.2) (1.3) (1.1) Other income, net — 0.2 0.1 Income before income taxes 19.4 19.3 18.2 Provision for income taxes (4.5) (9.9) (4.9) Net income 14.9 9.4 13.3 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.2) (0.1) (0.2) Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 14.7 % 9.3 % 13.1 % 2018 Compared to 2017 Net sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market. 25 Table of Contents The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2018 2017 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 7,781.9 $ 6,606.9 18 % 1 % 17 % 3 % 14 % Cable Products and Solutions 420.1 404.4 4 % (2) % 6 % — % 6 % Consolidated $ 8,202.0 $ 7,011.3 17 % — % 17 % 3 % 14 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2018 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,241.4 in 2018 versus $1,978.4 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to 2017. Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017. Operating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 and $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs. Interest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017. Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion 26 Table of Contents of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises. Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in both years, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 1,686.9 20.6 % $ 1,205.0 23.4 % $ 3.85 $ 1,427.6 20.4 % $ 650.5 51.1 % $ 2.06 Acquisition-related expenses 8.5 0.1 7.2 - 0.02 4.0 - 3.7 - 0.01 Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation - - (19.8) 1.2 (0.06) - - (66.6) 4.9 (0.21) Tax Act Charge (benefit) - - (14.5) 0.9 (0.04) - - 398.5 (29.5) 1.26 Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,695.4 20.7 % $ 1,177.9 25.5 % $ 3.77 $ 1,431.6 20.4 % $ 986.1 26.5 % $ 3.12 (1) While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. 2017 Compared to 2016 Net sales were $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6,286.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 8% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 12% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 9% organically in 2017, compared to 2016. The sales growth was driven primarily by growth in the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, mobile devices, military and commercial aerospace markets, with contributions from both organic strength as well as from the Company’s acquisitions, partially offset by a slight decline in sales in the mobile networks market. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $244.4), reflecting sales strength in heavy equipment, industrial instrumentation, oil and gas, and factory automation as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $177.0), driven by growth and expansion in all regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $115.0), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $101.1) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $77.8), driven by broad strength across substantially all segments of the market including increased sales into military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market slightly increased (approximately $9.9) primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions as well as strength in large passenger planes, partially offset by continued weakness in demand for business 27 Table of Contents jets and helicopters. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $20.3), primarily due to reduced overall capital spending by mobile operators. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in constant currencies in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to contributions from an acquisition made during the second half of 2016. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016: Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) 2017 2016 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 6,606.9 $ 5,922.3 12 % — % 12 % 3 % 9 % Cable Products and Solutions 404.4 364.1 11 % 1 % 10 % 9 % 1 % Consolidated $ 7,011.3 $ 6,286.4 12 % — % 12 % 4 % 8 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 11 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2017 increased approximately 14% in U.S. dollars ($1,978.4 in 2017 versus $1,740.7 in 2016) and 8% organically, compared to 2016. Foreign sales in 2017 increased approximately 11% in U.S. dollars ($5,032.9 in 2017 versus $4,545.7 in 2016), 10% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to 2016 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2017 did not significantly impact net sales compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017, compared to $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016. Administrative expenses increased approximately $28.9 in 2017 primarily related to increases in stock-based compensation expense, employee-related benefits and amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2017 and 4.9% of net sales in 2016. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.6 in 2017 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2017 and 2.6% of net sales in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $23.6 in 2017 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2017 and 5.1% of net sales in 2016. Operating income was $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017, compared to $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016. Operating income for 2017 includes $4.0 of acquisition-related expenses, related to external transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which includes external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte. Ltd. (“FCI”), as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,431.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017 and $1,241.8 or 19.8% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2017 compared to 2016, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2017 was $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales, compared to $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales in 2016. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 was $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales, compared to $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs. 28 Table of Contents Interest expense was $92.3 in 2017 compared to $72.6 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels, which resulted from the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs, as well as higher average interest rates partially driven by the senior note issuances in April 2017. Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 51.1% in 2017 and 27.0% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5, partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 related to stock-based compensation. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 26.5% for both 2017 and 2016, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017, compared to $822.9 and $2.61, respectively, for 2016. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned (a) Tax Act Charge, (b) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (c) the acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017, compared to $856.0 and $2.72, respectively, for 2016. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 1,427.6 20.4 % $ 650.5 51.1 % $ 2.06 $ 1,205.2 19.2 % $ 822.9 27.0 % $ 2.61 Acquisition-related expenses 4.0 - 3.7 - 0.01 36.6 0.6 33.1 (0.5) 0.11 Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation - - (66.6) 4.9 (0.21) - - - - - Tax Act Charge - - 398.5 (29.5) 1.26 - - - - - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,431.6 20.4 % $ 986.1 26.5 % $ 3.12 $ 1,241.8 19.8 % $ 856.0 26.5 % $ 2.72 (1) While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Cash Requirements At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,291.7 and $1,753.7, respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. The Company used approximately $400, net of cash acquired, of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 to fund the acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”) in January 2019, as described below. In addition, in January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the Company’s $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019. Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax on all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company 29 Table of Contents recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0. As a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017 the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made, and the Company made foreign and U.S. state and local payments of approximately $69.0 on repatriations in 2018. The Company intends to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2018 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 7) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months. The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings). The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s senior notes, revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs. The Company also may use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as we did with the January 2019 acquisition of SSI. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2019 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales. Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,112.7 $ 1,144.2 $ 1,077.6 Net cash used in investing activities (441.8) (380.2) (1,612.7) Net cash used in financing activities (1,070.1) (140.1) (133.5) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (40.6) 60.6 (34.0) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (439.8) $ 684.5 $ (702.6) Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for 2018 is primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”). Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Operating Cash Flow was $1,144.2 for 2017 compared to $1,077.6 for 2016. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net income (excluding the effects of the non-cash Tax Act Charge of $398.5), which more than offset a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. 30 Table of Contents In 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased $193.2 to $1,791.8 primarily due to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $126.9 to $1,233.8, primarily to support higher sales levels, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 74 days and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $57.5 to $254.3 primarily due to the increase in other receivables and prepaid expenses as well as the recording of contract assets of $25.4 as a result of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (Topic 606, as discussed below). Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $59.0 to $875.8, primarily due to capital additions of approximately $340.2, partially offset by depreciation of $247.6, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $60.6 to $4,103.2 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in 2018, partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $5.8 to $494.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $8.0 recognized related to 2018 acquisitions and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset by the amortization of $46.9 on the Company’s intangible assets and Translation. Accounts payable increased $14.9 to $890.5, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, which was partially offset by Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 53 and 60, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $93.8 to $796.5, primarily as a result of an increase in certain accrued employee-related compensation and benefit costs, as well as accrued income taxes, net of the tax payments of (i) the first annual installment payment of the Transition Tax and (ii) foreign and U.S. state and local taxes paid related to foreign cash repatriated. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.8 to $190.2, primarily due to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, decreased $34.8 to $532.8, primarily as a result of certain long-term tax liabilities becoming current. In 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”, which is comprised of its U.S. Plans together with its foreign plans) of approximately $88.3, of which approximately $81.0 was related to the January 2018 voluntary contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily related to an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. 2018 2017 2016 Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) $ 1,112.7 $ 1,144.2 $ 1,077.6 Capital expenditures (GAAP) (310.6) (226.6) (190.8) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ 802.1 $ 917.6 $ 886.8 31 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $441.8 in 2018, compared to $380.2 in 2017 and $1,612.7 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of $107.8. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $1,305.1 in cash to fund acquisitions, most significantly the acquisition of FCI for $1,178.6, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $183.7, and purchases of short-term investments, net of $123.9. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,070.1 in 2018, compared to $140.1 in 2017 and $133.5 in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $935.2, net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, dividend payments of $253.7, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program of $5.6, partially offset by net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $618.0, repayment of the Company’s 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, dividend payments of $205.0, purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $24.4 and payments of costs related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, net borrowings under the commercial paper program of $154.1, and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of commercial paper of $183.2. The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”), which matured in March 2021 and gave the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility required payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and required that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its 2016 Revolving Credit Facility with a new $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. 32 Table of Contents The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of December 31, 2018 was $554.5. On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was €60.0 (approximately $68.8). Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors’ authorization for the ECP Notes limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0, which was then further increased to $2,500.0 in conjunction with the amended 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time was also increased to $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time remains at $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay the Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 750.0 2.55 % January 2019 400.0 2.20 % April 2020 375.0 3.125 % September 2021 500.0 4.00 % February 2022 350.0 3.20 % April 2024 € 500.0 2.00 % October 2028 (Euro Notes) The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. On April 5, 2017, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 (the “2020 Senior Notes”) and $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024 (the “2024 Senior Notes” and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the “2020 and 2024 Notes”). In September 2017, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 and 2024 Notes to repay all of its outstanding $375.0 principal amount of 1.55% Senior Notes due September 15, 2017, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”, and collectively with the Senior Notes in the United States, “Senior Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. 33 Table of Contents On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the outstanding amount of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019. The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt. On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Approximately 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, have been retained in Treasury stock. From January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.6, leaving approximately $1,396.2 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to 10 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ended January 20, 2017 (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $325.8. These shares have been retired by the Company. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 First Quarter $ 0.19 $ 0.16 $ 0.14 Second Quarter 0.23 0.16 0.14 Third Quarter 0.23 0.19 0.14 Fourth Quarter 0.23 0.19 0.16 The following table summarizes the dividends declared per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 Dividends declared $ 264.3 $ 213.7 $ 178.8 Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year) 253.7 205.0 172.7 34 Table of Contents Pensions The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2018 to $178.5 ($4.8 of which represents the expected benefit payments to be made during 2019 primarily for unfunded foreign plans, as included in other accrued expenses) from $256.9 in 2017 primarily due to the voluntary contribution of $81.0 made in January 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans as well as the impact of higher discount rates on our projected benefit obligation. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Acquisitions In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $400, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment. The acquisition of SSI was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. SSI, which is headquartered in the state of Wisconsin in the United States, is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. For a discussion of certain risks attendant to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels” in Part I, Item 1A herein. Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein. 35 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment recorded in 2018 related to this charge. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: · Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. · Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. · Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income). · Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amphenol’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. · Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of 36 Table of Contents which are derived from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. · Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Adoption of Topic 606 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”) as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not retrospectively adjusted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were recognized in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy then in effect under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“Topic 605”) discussed below. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under Topic 605. The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers or OEM) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price. The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our 37 Table of Contents manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the products are pulled from consignment inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2018, less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have significant contract assets or contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pre-adoption of Topic 606 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from sales of the Company’s products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered, title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer, provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable. Such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point, the sales price was fixed and determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Delivery was determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which was primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $800, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. The amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated would not be material. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017, the Company recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act also included a global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") provision, which imposes a tax on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost if incurred, rather than recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. The U.S. Treasury Department has not yet released final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate. 38 Table of Contents In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional income tax charges as a result of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act’s enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company had not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act in 2017. As discussed in Note 1 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, SAB 118 was subsequently codified under ASU 2018-05 in March 2018. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare these provisional amounts. The Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act Charge and recorded an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018. Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2018, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied. Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt (1) $ 3,584.5 $ 764.4 $ 1,399.1 $ 500.1 $ 920.9 Interest related to senior notes (1) 303.4 72.7 113.0 55.2 62.5 Operating leases 197.3 70.5 64.9 28.4 33.5 Purchase obligations (2) 414.2 384.9 23.6 3.4 2.3 Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (3) 58.9 7.3 12.0 12.0 27.6 Transition tax (4) 151.4 13.6 27.2 39.0 71.6 Total (5) $ 4,709.7 $ 1,313.4 $ 1,639.8 $ 638.1 $ 1,118.4 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2018, were approximately $19.8. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance. The table above also excludes the expected interest payments associated with the $500.0 principal of unsecured 4.350% senior notes issued in January 2019. (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production. (3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans and the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2019. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $81.0 in 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2019 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets. (4) As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on certain assumptions made upon the Company’s then current interpretation of the Tax Act. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the provisional amount, and consequently completed its accounting and recorded an adjustment related to the Transition Tax. The amounts noted in the table above reflect the final Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions and in accordance with the Tax Act is to be paid over the eight year period which started in 2018. The first installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the second quarter of 2018. (5) As of December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded liabilities of approximately $167.3 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. In July 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (collectively, the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a Euro Commercial Paper Program, and then in October 2018, issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) of unsecured 2.000% senior notes (“2028 Euro Notes”) due October 8, 2028. While the 2028 Euro Notes are denominated in Euros, any borrowings under the Company’s Euro Commercial Paper Program may be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro. When borrowing in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of debt. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had two forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Great Britain Pound and Korean Won intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2019 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans. The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2018 resulted in a net asset of $2.4. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company currently has outstanding various fixed rate series of senior notes over various maturity dates. In October 2018, the Euro Issuer issued the 2028 Euro Notes, and the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program (collectively, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the 4.350% Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 30, 2019. While there were no such borrowings as of December 31, 2018, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR. Any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $639.9, or 18% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, which related primarily to the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs, were subject to floating interest rates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program was 2.88% and 1.71%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program was (0.10)%. A 10% change in the interest rate at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for either or both Commercial Paper Programs would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly. 40 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:56.981585
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion and details on this development.​As of December 31, 2019, approximately 89% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured Senior Notes:​​​​​​​Principal ​Fixed​​Amount ​Interest​​(in millions) ​Rate​Maturity$ 400.0 ​2.20% April 2020​ 227.7 ​3.125% September 2021​ 295.0 ​4.00% February 2022​ 350.0 ​3.20% April 2024​ 500.0 ​4.35% June 2029​ 900.0 ​2.80% February 2030€ 500.0 ​2.00% October 2028 (Euro Notes)​Legal and regulatory risks​Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks. ​We are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. government, including laws and regulations governing performance of U.S. government contracts, the use and treatment of U.S. government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. We may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. government or its suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government, as noted herein in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.15 Table of Contents​In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are also prohibited from assigning prime U.S. government contracts without the prior consent of the U.S. government contracting officer. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​The Company is subject to governmental export and import controls.​Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargoes. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S. administration, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company’s customers based in China to its “Entity List”, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers, and such restrictions could prohibit the Company from selling products to such customers. If we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.​Cybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.​Cybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. The Company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, but the impact of such attacks has not been material. Cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and the misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary technological information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers. Despite the Company’s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and the state of California’s California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020, impose significant new requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR, CCPA or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results. ​​16 Table of ContentsChanges in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results.​The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is also subject to tax examinations by various tax authorities and in addition, new examinations could be initiated by tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations. ​Any future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company’s current, non-current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​The Company relies on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.​We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in national or international laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.​The Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.​The Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand. While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not respond in all cases and the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. ​The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect its business.​The Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While the Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company’s former or current properties, either owned or leased. Such liabilities could result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise at any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.​17 Table of ContentsItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments​None.​Item 2. Properties​The Company’s fixed assets include plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Company’s plants, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2019, the Company operated a total of approximately 475 plants, warehouses and offices of which (a) the locations in the U.S. had approximately 4.2 million square feet, of which approximately 1.9 million square feet were leased; (b) the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 17.5 million square feet, of which approximately 13.3 million square feet were leased; and (c) the square footage by segment was approximately 20.4 million square feet and approximately 1.3 million square feet for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and the Cable Products and Solutions segment, respectively.​The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities. ​Item 3. Legal Proceedings​The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising from normal business activities. Although the potential liability with respect to certain of such legal actions cannot be reasonably estimated, none of such matters is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A herein for additional information regarding legal risks and uncertainties.​In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. The Company is cooperating with the request. The Company is currently unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.​Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures​Not applicable.​​18 Table of ContentsPART II​Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities​Market Information​The Company effected the initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) in November 1991. The Company’s Common Stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under the ticker symbol “APH”. As of January 31, 2020, there were 35 holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock. A significant number of outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms. The Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock. ​Stock Performance Graph​The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return of Amphenol over a period of five years ending December 31, 2019 with the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) Stock Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components & Equipment Index.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 6.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $601.7 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases in 2019, 5.5 million shares, or $514.1 million, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 1.0 million shares, or $87.6 million, were retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase. From January 1, 2020 through January 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.3 million additional shares of Common Stock for $29.0 million, leaving $816.1 million available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. ​The table below reflects the Company’s stock repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​Total Number of​Maximum Dollar​(dollars in millions, except price per share)​​​​​​Shares Purchased as​Value of Shares​​​Total Number​Average​Part of Publicly​that May Yet be​​​of Shares​Price Paid​Announced Plans or​Purchased Under the​Period​Purchased per Share Programs Plans or Programs​First Quarter - 2019​ 1,773,423​$ 90.24​ 1,773,423​$ 1,286.7​Second Quarter - 2019​ 2,642,694​​ 94.09​ 2,642,694​​ 1,038.1​Third Quarter - 2019​ 1,695,800​​ 88.43​ 1,695,800​​ 888.1​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fourth Quarter - 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​October 1 to October 31, 2019 —​ — — ​ 888.1​November 1 to November 30, 2019 146,100​ 102.57 146,100 ​ 873.1​December 1 to December 31, 2019 272,269​ 103.04 272,269 ​ 845.1​​​ 418,369​​ 102.88​ 418,369​​ 845.1​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total - 2019 6,530,286​$ 92.14 6,530,286 $ 845.1​​​20 Table of Contents​​Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)​The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meanings, respectively, as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.​In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.​Overview​General​Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable.

In 2019, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $38.1 resulting from stock option exercises, partially offset by (b) acquisition-related expenses of $25.4 ($21.0 after-tax) primarily from the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog as well as external transaction costs and (c) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt of $14.3 ($12.5 after-tax), comprised primarily of the premiums and other fees incurred from the early extinguishment of redeemed amounts of our 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes resulting from the tender offers in September 2019 described herein under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities”. In 2018, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018, along with excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 7 herein, decreased by 3% and 2%, respectively, in 2019. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2019, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,502.3, which net of capital expenditures of $295.0, resulted in Free cash flow of $1,207.3. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7 herein.​Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017​On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the Tax Act, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (“Tax Act Charge”). The Tax Act Charge was a provisional amount recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which was subsequently codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Consistent with ASU 2018-05, the Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act Charge and recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018, reflecting the interpretive guidance that was issued subsequent to our 2017 Form 10-K filing. While the Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the regulatory guidance issued at that time, the Department of Treasury interpretive guidance initiatives are ongoing. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Act. ​23 Table of ContentsResults of Operations​The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​​ 2019 ​2018 ​2017 ​Net sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​Cost of sales 68.2​​ 67.6​​ 67.1​​Acquisition-related expenses 0.3​​ 0.1​​ —​​Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.8​​ 11.7​​ 12.5​​Operating income 19.7​​ 20.6​​ 20.4​​Interest expense (1.4)​​ (1.2)​​ (1.3)​​Loss on early extinguishment of debt​ (0.2)​​ —​​ —​​Other income, net 0.1​​ —​​ 0.2​​Income before income taxes 18.2​​ 19.4​​ 19.3​​Provision for income taxes (4.1)​​ (4.5)​​ (9.9)​​Net income 14.1​​ 14.9​​ 9.4​​Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1)​​ (0.2)​​ (0.1)​​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 14.0% ​ 14.7% ​ 9.3% ​​2019 Compared to 2018​Net sales were $8,225.4 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was flat in U.S. dollars, an increase of 2% in constant currencies and a decrease of 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in constant currencies, while decreasing 3% organically, in 2019 compared to 2018. The sales growth was driven by strong growth in the military and commercial aerospace markets as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was largely offset by reductions in the communications-related markets, in particular the mobile devices market, along with the negative effect of currency translation. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $181.0), driven by broad-based strength across essentially all segments including military vehicle, rotorcraft, and military airframe applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $48.7) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $66.1), primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions, as well as strength in medical and factory automation applications, which were partially offset by moderations in industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment and transportation, as well as other applications. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $38.0), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions, which were partially offset by moderations in demand due to the slowing of the worldwide automotive market. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market slightly increased (approximately $5.6), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions and organic growth of sales to data center customers, offset by moderations in market demand for storage and networking related products. Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased (approximately $277.5), driven by moderations in sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $10.2), due to reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, offset in part by contributions from acquisitions. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 7% organically in 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand from broadband service providers.​24 Table of ContentsThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage Growth (relative to prior year)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net sales​Foreign​Constant​​​Organic​​​​​growth in​currency​Currency Net​Acquisition​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​U.S. Dollars (1)​impact (2)​ Sales Growth (3)​impact (4)​Growth (3)​​ 2019 2018 (GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​Net sales: ​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interconnect Products and Assemblies​$ 7,840.3 $ 7,781.9​ 1% ​ (1)% ​ 2% ​ 5% ​ (3)% ​Cable Products and Solutions​ 385.1​ 420.1​ (8)% ​ (2)% ​ (6)% ​ 1% ​ (7)% ​Consolidated​$ 8,225.4​$ 8,202.0​ —% ​ (2)% ​ 2% ​ 5% ​ (3)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the accompanying financial statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales.(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. ​Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2019 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,524.7 in 2019 versus $2,241.4 in 2018) and 4% organically, compared to 2018. Foreign sales in 2019 decreased approximately 4% in U.S. dollars ($5,700.7 in 2019 versus $5,960.6 in 2018), 2% in constant currencies and 6% organically, compared to 2018, driven by moderations in Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $125.8 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2018.​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $971.4 or 11.8% of net sales for 2019, compared to $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018. Administrative expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in both years. Research and development expenses increased approximately $13.3 in 2019 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2019 and 2.7% of net sales in 2018. Selling and marketing expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in both years.​Operating income was $1,619.2 or 19.7% of net sales in 2019, compared to $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018. Operating income for 2019 included acquisition-related expenses of $25.4, comprising of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from 2019 acquisitions, with the remainder representing external transaction costs. Operating income for 2018 included acquisition-related expenses of $8.5, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,644.6 or 20.0% of net sales in 2019 and $1,695.4 or 20.7% in 2018. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2019 was $1,722.7 or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales in 2018. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 was $39.5 or 10.2% of net sales, compared to $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales in 2018. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.​Interest expense was $117.6 in 2019 compared to $101.7 in 2018. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels and the higher average interest rate associated with the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019 (the net proceeds of which, along with commercial paper borrowings, were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes also in January 2019). ​Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $14.3 in 2019, which related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in 25 Table of ContentsSeptember 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section within this Item 7 for further information related to the Tendered Notes. ​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 22.2% in 2019 and 23.4% in 2018. Provision for income taxes in 2019 included excess tax benefits of $38.1 from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by the tax effects related to (i) acquisition-related expenses during the year and (ii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Provision for income taxes in 2018 included (i) excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, which were partially offset by the tax effect related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% and 25.5% for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $1,155.0 and $3.75, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,150.4 and $3.74, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018.​The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019​2018​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPS​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 1,619.2 19.7% $ 1,155.0​ 22.2% $ 3.75​$ 1,686.9 20.6% $ 1,205.0​ 23.4% $ 3.85Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 25.4​ 0.3​​ 21.0​ (0.1)​​ 0.07​​ 8.5​ 0.1​​ 7.2​ -​​ 0.02Loss on early extinguishment of debt​​ -​ -​​ 12.5​ (0.1)​​ 0.04​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ -​ -​​ (38.1)​ 2.5​​ (0.12)​​ -​ -​​ (19.8)​ 1.2​​ (0.06)Tax Act Charge (benefit)​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -​​ -​ -​​ (14.5)​ 0.9​​ (0.04)Adjusted (non-GAAP)​$ 1,644.6​ 20.0% $ 1,150.4​ 24.5% $ 3.74​$ 1,695.4​ 20.7% $ 1,177.9​ 25.5% $ 3.77(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.​2018 Compared to 2017​Net sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to 26 Table of Contentsthe industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market.​The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage Growth (relative to prior year)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net sales​Foreign​Constant​​​Organic​​​​​growth in​currency​Currency Net​Acquisition​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​U.S. Dollars (1)​impact (2)​ Sales Growth (3)​impact (4)​Growth (3)​​ 2018 2017 (GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​Net sales: ​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interconnect Products and Assemblies​$ 7,781.9 $ 6,606.9​ 18% ​ 1% ​ 17% ​3% ​ 14% ​Cable Products and Solutions​ 420.1​ 404.4​ 4% ​ (2)% ​ 6% ​ —% ​ 6% ​Consolidated​$ 8,202.0​$ 7,011.3​ 17% ​ —% ​ 17% ​3% ​ 14% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the accompanying financial statements.

Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017.​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017.​Operating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 27 Table of Contentsand $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.​Interest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017.​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises. Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017.​The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2018​2017​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 1,686.9 20.6% $ 1,205.0​ 23.4% $ 3.85​$ 1,427.6 20.4% $ 650.5​ 51.1% $ 2.06Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 8.5​ 0.1​​ 7.2​ -​​ 0.02​​ 4.0​ -​​ 3.7​ -​​ 0.01Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ -​ -​​ (19.8)​ 1.2​​ (0.06)​​ -​ -​​ (66.6)​ 4.9​​ (0.21)Tax Act Charge (benefit)​​ -​ -​​ (14.5)​ 0.9​​ (0.04)​​ -​ -​​ 398.5​ (29.5)​​ 1.26Adjusted (non-GAAP)​$ 1,695.4​ 20.7% $ 1,177.9​ 25.5% $ 3.77​$ 1,431.6​ 20.4% $ 986.1​ 26.5% $ 3.12​(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.​28 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources​Liquidity and Cash Requirements​At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $908.6 and $1,291.7, respectively. The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is located outside of the United States. ​Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax (“Transition Tax”) on all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted and finalized in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. ​As a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017, the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. On December 31, 2018, the Company indicated its intention to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and accrue foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to distribute certain 2019 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate as of December 31, 2019, and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2019 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2019 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $900, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. ​The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.​The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes (including the 2.20% Senior Notes due in April 2020), Revolving Credit Facility, and Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2020 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.​Cash Flow Summary​The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​ 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities ​$ 1,502.3​$ 1,112.7​$ 1,144.2Net cash used in investing activities ​ (1,228.8)​ (441.8)​ (380.2)Net cash used in financing activities ​ (648.4)​ (1,070.1)​ (140.1)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents ​ (13.2)​ (40.6)​ 60.6Net change in cash and cash equivalents ​$ (388.1)​$ (439.8)​$ 684.529 Table of Contents​Operating Activities​The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) was $1,502.3 for 2019 compared to $1,112.7 for 2018. The increase in Operating Cash Flow for 2019 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In addition, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 also reflected the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans was made in 2019. Operating Cash Flow was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in Operating Cash Flow for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. Plans. Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. ​In 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $81.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $129.3 and accounts payable of $60.2, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $117.3. In 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. ​The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $55.4 to $1,736.4 primarily due to lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $76.3 to $1,310.1, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 80 days and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $123.2 to $999.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $295.0 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $240.0, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $763.9 to $4,867.1 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to nine acquisitions that closed in 2019, partially offset by Translation. Other intangible assets, net increased $44.1 to $442.0 primarily due to the recognition of certain identifiable intangible assets of $111.8 related to the 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $67.3. Other long-term assets increased $199.8 to $296.2 primarily due to the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 1 and Note 10 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $196.7 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of December 31, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $23.7 to $866.8, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity and Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 53 days. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $66.1 to $862.6, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $54.0 of current operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased $151.6 to $684.4, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $145.4 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019.​In 2019 and 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $6.6 and $88.3, respectively, of which approximately $81.0 of the 2018 contributions related to the January 2018 voluntary cash contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions 30 Table of Contentsto any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. ​In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019 2018 2017Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) $ 1,502.3 $ 1,112.7 $ 1,144.2Capital expenditures (GAAP)​ (295.0)​ (310.6)​ (226.6)Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)​$ 1,207.3​$ 802.1​$ 917.6​Investing Activities​Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions. ​Net cash used in investing activities was $1,228.8 in 2019, compared to $441.8 in 2018 and $380.2 in 2017. In 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $937.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $287.6, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.8. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 to fund acquisitions, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $107.8. ​Financing Activities​Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. ​Net cash used in financing activities was $648.4 in 2019, compared to $1,070.1 in 2018 and $140.1 in 2017. In 2019, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) the aggregate repayments of certain of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt (primarily the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) of $1,111.5, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $601.7, (iii) dividend payments of $279.5, (iv) net repayments under the Company’s commercial paper programs of $229.0, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $43.3, (vi) payments of costs of $14.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2029 Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined below), and (vii) premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by (i) aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes of $1,398.8 and (ii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $246.1. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $935.2, (ii) net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, (iii) dividend payments of $253.7, (iv) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and (v) payments of costs of $5.6 related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program, partially offset by (i) net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and (ii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $618.0, (ii) repayment of the Company’s 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, (iii) dividend payments of $205.0, (iv) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $24.4, and (v) payments of costs of $5.2 related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes, partially offset by (i) borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, (ii) net borrowings under the U.S. commercial paper program of $154.1, and (iii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1.31 Table of Contents​The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. ​On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. ​The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of December 31, 2019 was $160.0.​On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was €210.0 (approximately $235.5). Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2019, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,500.0, consistent with the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.​As of December 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:​​​​​​​Principal Interest ​Amount Rate​Maturity$ 400.0 2.20% April 2020​ 227.7 3.125% September 2021​ 295.0 4.00% February 2022​ 350.0 3.20% April 2024​ 500.0 4.35% June 2029​ 900.0 2.80% February 2030€ 500.0 2.00% October 2028 (Euro Notes)​The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.

These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program 33 Table of Contentsduring the nine months ended December 31, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 10.6 million shares for $935.2 during the year ended December 31, 2018.​Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019​2018​2017First Quarter​$ 0.23​$ 0.19​$ 0.16Second Quarter​​ 0.23​​ 0.23​​ 0.16Third Quarter​​ 0.25​​ 0.23​​ 0.19Fourth Quarter​​ 0.25​​ 0.23​​ 0.19Total​$ 0.96​$ 0.88​$ 0.70​The following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2019​2018​2017Dividends declared​$ 285.3​$ 264.3​$ 213.7Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)​ 279.5​ 253.7​ 205.0​​LIBOR Transition​In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred benchmark alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, SOFR represents a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is calculated based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of LIBOR (which ultimately may or may not be SOFR), from both a risk management and financial reporting perspective, including the review of potential issues that might arise in connection with this transition. Our current portfolio of debt and financial instruments tied to LIBOR consists primarily of our Commercial Paper Programs and Revolving Credit Facility, the latter of which has no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2019. Due to our current limited reliance on borrowings tied to LIBOR, the Company does not believe that this transition will have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​Pensions​The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2019 to $184.8 from $178.5 in 2018 primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates on our projected benefit obligation, which was partially offset by higher actual returns on plan assets. In 2018, the Company also made a voluntary cash contribution of $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. ​Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.​34 Table of ContentsAcquisitions​In January 2019, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $400, net of cash acquired, plus a performance-related contingent payment. The acquisition of SSI was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. SSI, which is headquartered in the state of Wisconsin in the United States, is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. ​During 2019, the Company completed nine acquisitions (including SSI) for $937.4, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. These acquisitions were not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.​Environmental Matters​Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​Inflation and Costs​The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. For a discussion of certain risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels” in Part I, Item 1A herein.​Foreign Exchange​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein.​Non-GAAP Financial Measures​In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law (including the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment 35 Table of Contentsrecorded in 2018 related to this charge). Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. ​The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: ​●Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.​●Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. ​●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income).​●Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amphenol’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.​●Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.​●Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. 36 Table of Contents​Recent Accounting Pronouncements​Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.​​Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates​The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes that the most significant areas involving critical accounting policies are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.​Revenue Recognition ​Topic 606​The Company’s net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”), resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of Topic 606 applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The comparative results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recognized in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy then in effect under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“Topic 605”), as discussed below. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under Topic 605. ​The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price. ​The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the products are pulled from consignment inventory. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of 37 Table of Contentscontrol. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. ​Pre-adoption of Topic 606​For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue from sales of the Company’s products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered, title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer, provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable. Such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point, the sales price was fixed and determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Delivery was determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which was primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.​Income Taxes​Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $900, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. ​As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017, the Company recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.​In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which was codified under ASU 2018-05, to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In 2017, the Company recorded a provisional income tax charge as a result of the Tax Act. Consistent with ASU 2018-05, the Company completed its accounting and recorded an income tax benefit in 2018.​​38 Table of ContentsDisclosures about contractual obligations and commitments​The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2019, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations ​​ Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions)​Total​1 year​years​years​5 years Debt (1)​$ 3,630.3​$ 403.5​$ 523.4​$ 745.8​$ 1,957.6​Interest related to senior notes (1)​ 670.7​ 92.7​ 163.6​ 133.1​ 281.3​Operating leases (2)​ 219.4​ 58.8​ 73.3​ 39.9​ 47.4​Purchase obligations (3)​ 431.1​ 398.4​ 25.6​ 4.6​ 2.5​Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (4)​ 58.7​ 7.5​ 11.5​ 11.8​ 27.9​Transition tax (5)​ 133.4​ 11.4​ 31.6​ 69.1​ 21.3​Total (6)​$ 5,143.6​$ 972.3​$ 829.0​$ 1,004.3​$ 2,338.0​(1)The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2019, were approximately $22.1. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.​(2)The Company’s operating lease payments included in this table reflect the future minimum undiscounted fixed lease payments, which serve as the basis for calculating the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. The table above excludes any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 842, due to their uncertainty. Finance leases are not material to the Company individually or in the aggregate and as such, have been excluded from the table above. ​(3)Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production.​(4)Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans, the most significant funded plan of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2020. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $81.0 in 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans, while no such voluntary contribution was made in 2019. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2020 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.​(5)As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on certain assumptions made upon the Company’s then current interpretation of the Tax Act. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the provisional amount, and consequently completed its accounting and recorded an adjustment related to the Transition Tax. The amounts noted in the table above reflect the final Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions, and in accordance with the Tax Act, is to be paid over the eight year period starting in 2018. The second installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the second quarter of 2019. ​(6)As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded net liabilities of approximately $183.5 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid.​39 Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk​(amounts in millions)​The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.​Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations.​In July 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (collectively, the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a Euro Commercial Paper Program, and then in October 2018, issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) of unsecured 2.000% senior notes (“2028 Euro Notes”) due October 8, 2028. While the 2028 Euro Notes are denominated in Euros, any borrowings under the Company’s Euro Commercial Paper Program may be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro. When borrowing in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of debt.​The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of such contracts was not material. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments.​Interest Rate Risk​The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company currently has outstanding various fixed rate series of senior notes over various maturity dates, two of which were issued in 2019. In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 2029, the net proceeds of which, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, were used to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 30, 2019. In September 2019, the Company issued $900.0 of unsecured 2.80% Senior Notes due February 2030, the net proceeds of which were used to repay the cash consideration payable as a result of the tender offers associated with the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.​While there were no such borrowings as of December 31, 2019, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR. Any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $400, or 11% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, which related primarily to the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs, were subject to floating interest rates. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program was 1.85% and 2.88%, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program was (0.13)% and (0.10)%, respectively. A 10% change in the interest rate at December 31, 2019 and 2018 for either or both Commercial Paper Programs would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2020, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.​40 Table of Contents​",2023-12-30 21:46:56.487891
820313,APH,AMPHENOL CORP /DE/,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​Our Strategy​The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:​●Pursue broad diversification - The Company constantly drives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”.​●Develop high technology performance-enhancing interconnect solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across the Company’s markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.​●Expand global presence - The Company intends to further expand its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships. As the Company’s global customers expand their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers. The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities including new product development. The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia.​●Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and performance and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a 4 Table of Contentsreasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own.​●Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s position with customers across our diverse end markets, our leading technologies and our access to low-cost manufacturing around the world.

Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important strength of the Company.​There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment. As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with customers in developing new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products. In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and performance and lower product lead-time and cost. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s sales, refer to the subsection titled “Risks related to our end markets” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​The Company’s products are sold to thousands of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in numerous countries throughout the world. The Company’s products are also sold to electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) companies, to original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and to service providers, including telecommunications network service providers and web service providers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, aggregate sales to Apple Inc., including sales of products to EMS companies that the Company believes are manufacturing products on Apple’s behalf, accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. ​The Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent representatives and a global network of electronics distributors. The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 16% and 15% of the Company’s net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition to product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, the Company uses key account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.​Manufacturing​The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining, extruding, die casting and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for specialty and coaxial cable production, antenna and sensor fabrication. Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are certified under the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (the “ISO”), specifically to the ISO 9000 series of quality standards, and many of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are certified to other quality standards, including QS 9000, ISO 14000 and TS 16949.​The Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically-integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. The Company has an established manufacturing presence in approximately 40 countries. Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to particular geographies. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.​The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to ensure proximity and outstanding service to customers, while also lowering production and logistics costs. The Company’s strategy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital investments. The Company sources 8 Table of Contentsits products on a worldwide basis. To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established certain facilities near these major customers. The Company seeks to position its manufacturing and assembly facilities in order to serve local markets while coordinating, as appropriate, product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s foreign operations, refer to the subsection titled “Risks related to our global operations” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Research and Development​The Company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application specific products, the Company is able to decrease its exposure to standard products, which are more likely to experience greater pricing pressure. At the end of 2020, our research, development, and engineering efforts, which relate to the creation of new and improved products and processes, were supported by approximately 3,300 employees and were performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and product technologies. ​Intellectual Property​Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to mechanical, electrical, optical and electronic features of connector, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.​We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.​From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes with third parties regarding the Company’s or such third party’s intellectual property assets, particularly patents. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents, or by a third party’s successful enforcement of its patents against us or any of our products. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company relies on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Raw Materials​The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials. The Company also purchases a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of its products. Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components or, if one source is used, the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements. The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production. Information regarding our obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of certain risks related to raw materials and components, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​9 Table of ContentsCompetition​The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Primary competitors within the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment include Aptiv, Carlisle, Commscope, Eaton, Foxconn, Hirose, Huber & Suhner, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity, Yazaki and 3M, among others. Primary competitors within the Cable Products and Solutions segment include Belden and Commscope, among others. In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products. For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Backlog and Seasonality​The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $2.380 billion compared with backlog of approximately $1.978 billion as of December 31, 2019. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.​Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in temporary changes to the seasonality of our business. For a discussion of certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the risk factor titled “We face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Human Capital Management and Our Culture​The Company’s success is based on the capability, adaptability and accountability of our people around the world. One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization. We believe this structure, with approximately 120 general managers running unique businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our employees has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.​As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 80,000 employees worldwide, with the majority of our people based in the Asia-Pacific region. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees. ​Governance and Culture - Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees. At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least annually, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, compensation and culture. We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.​Diversity and Inclusion - Our business spans the globe and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of our geographic footprint. The Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community. At Amphenol, we aim to create an inclusive working environment where all employees are respected and treated equally. This message is emphasized from the top of our organization down to each of our employees. A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders. Our core management team is comprised of these general managers, as well as their controllers and our 10 Table of Contentsexecutive team. Women represented 29% of this core management group at the end of 2020. Of our total employees worldwide, we are proud that approximately half are women.​Health, Safety and Well-being - The safety and well-being of our employees is critical to our successful operation. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team but are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees throughout the world, including in particular those employees who work in our factories. We have also encouraged employees to work from home when possible and appropriate and have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees optimally manage their work and personal responsibilities.​Community and Social Impact - Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work. Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services to immobile individuals. To support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we leveraged our global supply chain to procure face masks, sanitizer, thermometers and other critical supplies, which our teams donated to local hospitals, clinics, at risk individuals, our employees and their families.​Environmental Matters​Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of certain risks related to environmental matters, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect its business” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Available Information​The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Amphenol, that file with the SEC. Any such documents that the Company files with the SEC can be obtained by the public on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and all of the Company’s other filings with the SEC, such as quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), are also available to view, free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.amphenol.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Copies are also available without charge, from Amphenol Corporation, Investor Relations, 358 Hall Avenue, Wallingford, CT 06492. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.​11 Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors​Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair the Company’s business, operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition to the risk factor included below related to adverse public health developments and, in particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health and the global economy, the Company also notes that the effects of the pandemic have and may continue to impact many of the other risk factors described below. ​If actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company’s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company’s common stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.​Risks related to our global operations​Non-U.S. markets form a substantial portion of the Company’s business and as a result, the Company is more exposed to political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside the United States.​During 2020, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 71% of the Company’s net sales, with China constituting approximately 30% of the Company’s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company’s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. As a result, our financial results and our operations, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop or sell products, and the demand for our products, may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control. Because the Company has extensive non-U.S. operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the United States, it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including:​●instability in political or economic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, recession or slowing growth, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements, our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions, foreign currency exchange restrictions and devaluations, restrictive governmental controls on the movement and repatriation of earnings and capital, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, particularly in emerging markets;​●intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars, cyber attacks and acts of terrorism or war; and​●interruptions to the Company’s business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or cybersecurity incidents, inventory excesses, natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or tornadoes or adverse public health developments, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic discussed further below.​International trade or other disputes may result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, retaliatory governmental regulations or actions and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets.​Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.​The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. In recent years, there have been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, in particular trade policies and tariffs affecting China. Some of these trade policies, including the U.S.’s trading relationship with China, have been renegotiated during this timeframe and are subject to further changes in the future. Changes to current policies by the U.S. or other governments could affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on U.S. trade relations with China and other countries. The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our 12 Table of Contentscustomers to find alternative sourcing. In addition, other countries have changed and may continue to change their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s trading relationships or of new laws or regulations by the U.S. or other countries.​In addition to changes in U.S. trade policy, a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, such as:​●a global or regional economic slowdown in any of the Company’s market segments;●postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;●effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and/or fiscal policies in the United States and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;●employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;●industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;●difficulties protecting intellectual property;●longer payment cycles;●credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;●changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company’s benefit plans; ●the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements; ●social unrest due to escalating racial tensions in the United States and certain other countries where we operate; and●continuing uncertainty regarding the United Kingdom’s recent withdrawal from the European Union, otherwise known as “Brexit”.​We face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.​Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to our Company throughout most of 2020, particularly during the first half of the year. During the first quarter of 2020, these disruptions were primarily limited to our operations in China, which were closed for three weeks during January and February due to government mandates. As the virus spread to the rest of the world beginning in March and continuing throughout the remainder of 2020, most of our other operations outside of China were also impacted. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, we expect those disruptions to continue through the first half of 2021 and they could, potentially, extend for the full year and beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include, depending on the specific location, government regulations that limit our ability to operate certain of our facilities at full capacity and to adjust certain costs, travel restrictions, “work-from-home” orders, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, and reduced demand from certain customers. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability and effectiveness of vaccines, some of which have recently been approved and distributed for use, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. It is impossible to predict the overall future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity and financial results, and there can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our financial results in the future during any quarter or period in which we are affected.​13 Table of ContentsIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic increases the likelihood and potential severity of other risks (including some discussed separately within this Item 1A. Risk Factors), including but not limited to, the following:​●A protracted economic slowdown could negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, which may result in an increase in bankruptcies or insolvencies, a delay in payments and decreased sales.​●A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have a significant negative impact on the ability of the Company, its suppliers and its customers to conduct business.​●We have transitioned a significant subset of our employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This change may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information.​●If the vaccines that have recently been approved and distributed for use prove ineffective, we could experience another disruption in the global capital markets, which could increase the cost of, and adversely impact access to, capital (including the commercial paper markets) and increase economic uncertainty.​●If the financial performance of our businesses were to decline significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.​●If there is a general market downturn and continued high degree of volatility in the financial markets, we may experience a material re-valuation of, for example, our pension assets and obligations.​Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.​Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. ​We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements. Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.​The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating 14 Table of Contentsmargins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.​The Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.​The Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third party suppliers to secure these materials. Volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such materials. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. ​In limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic initially disrupted the supply of raw materials, primarily in the first half of 2020; reoccurrences of such unforeseen events may result in the Company experiencing difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels. Accordingly, such delays and associated risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​Risks related to our end markets​The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.​Approximately 46% of the Company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 15% of the Company’s 2020 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change. These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.​Approximately 4% and 6% of the Company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.​Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Company’s sales.​Approximately 12% of the Company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. and foreign government expenditures are also subject to 15 Table of Contentspolitical and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products.​The Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.​The Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 net sales. The Company’s long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, manufacture and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails, or is significantly delayed, in introducing new product line concepts or if the Company’s new products are not met with market acceptance, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.​The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.​The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.​Risks related to acquisitions​The Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.​The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including nine in 2019 and two in 2020. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform as expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including but not limited to: managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In some cases, the Company may pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business, such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims, such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of past or future acquisitions and investments, we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits and growth prospects will be achieved.​On December 9, 2020, the Company announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”) for $58.50 per share in cash, or approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired and including the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities. On January 19, 2021, the Company announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell the MTS Test & Simulation (“T&S”) business to Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”). The agreement to acquire MTS is expected to close by the middle of 2021, but is subject to certain regulatory approvals, approval from MTS’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions. The sale of the MTS T&S business to ITW is expected to close following the anticipated closing of our acquisition of MTS, but is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition of MTS and the sale of the MTS T&S business to ITW are subject to a number of risks that include, but are not limited to: (i) the risk that the proposed merger between Amphenol and MTS, and/or the proposed subsequent sale of the MTS T&S business to ITW, may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, (ii) unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the proposed transactions, the response of business partners and competitors to the announcement of the proposed transactions, potential disruptions to current plans and operations and/or potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the proposed transactions and (iii) the failure of the transactions, if completed, to deliver the financial benefits to Amphenol currently anticipated by the Amphenol management team.​16 Table of ContentsThe Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.​At December 31, 2020, the total assets of the Company were $12.3 billion, which included $5.0 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $397.5 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company’s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.​Risks related to our liquidity and capital resources​The Company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.​The Credit Agreement, as amended and restated effective January 15, 2019, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a syndicate of financial institutions (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which also backstops the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program (“U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) and Euro commercial paper program, contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company’s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Company’s credit facilities, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company’s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro commercial paper program.​The Company relies on the capital markets, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company’s results.​The Company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. While the Company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while the Company has not encountered any such issues to date, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to downgrade the Company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Company’s performance, it would likely increase the Company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​The Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.​The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, less than 1% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of foreign borrowings. A 10% change in the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or floating interest rates at December 31, 2020 would not have a material effect on the Company’s interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2021, although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly.​17 Table of ContentsIn 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On December 4, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration published a consultation on its intention to extend the publication of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”) rates until June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (the “SOFR”) as its preferred benchmark alternative to USD LIBOR. The SOFR represents a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is calculated based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on, and the market price for, our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and details on this development.​As of December 31, 2020, nearly all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured Senior Notes:​​​​​​​Principal ​Fixed​​Amount ​Interest​​(in millions) ​Rate​Maturity$ 227.7 ​3.125% September 2021​ 295.0 ​4.00% February 2022​ 350.0 ​3.20% April 2024​ 400.0​2.050% March 2025​ 500.0 ​4.350% June 2029​ 900.0 ​2.80% February 2030​​​​​​€ 500.0 ​0.750% May 2026 (Euro Notes)​ 500.0 ​2.00% October 2028 (Euro Notes)​Legal and regulatory risks​Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks. ​We are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. government, including laws and regulations governing performance of U.S. government contracts, the use and treatment of U.S. government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. We may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. government or its suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government, as noted herein in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are also prohibited from assigning prime U.S. government contracts without the prior consent of the U.S. government contracting officer. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​18 Table of ContentsThe Company is subject to governmental export and import controls.​Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargoes. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent U.S. administrations, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company’s customers based in China to its “Entity List”, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers, and such restrictions could prohibit the Company from selling products to such customers. If we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.​Cybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.​Cybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. While the Company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, the impact of such attacks has not been material. Cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and/or the misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information. Cybersecurity events could also result in the Company being unable to access critical data in a timely manner, or at all. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase our susceptibility to cybersecurity incidents and risks, especially as certain of our employees have transitioned and continue to work from home. Despite the Company’s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, release of highly sensitive confidential information, the inability to access critical data, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including financial information and current and future products under development, and also contains certain customer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us. In addition, in certain cases, in order to conduct business, we outsource to third-party business partners. We obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protection of our data; nonetheless, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyber attack. Any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities.​The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and the state of California’s California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020, impose significant new requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-19 Table of Contentscompliance with the GDPR, CCPA or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results. ​Changes in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results.​The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions, and in addition, new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations. ​Any future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company’s current and non-current tax liabilities, along with deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​The Company relies on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.​We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in national or international laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.​The Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.​The Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty, indemnity and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand. While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not respond in all cases and, where insurance exists, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. ​The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect its business.​The Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While the Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company’s former or current properties, either owned or leased. For example, as disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has been named as one of several defendants in four separate lawsuits filed in the State of Indiana relating to a manufacturing site in Franklin, Indiana where the Company has been conducting an environmental clean-up effort under the direction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. All costs incurred by the Company relating to these lawsuits as well as all costs associated with the clean-up effort at the manufacturing site are reimbursed by the former owner pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into in 20 Table of Contentsconnection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the Company’s business in 1987. Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise at any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.​Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments​None.​Item 2. Properties​The Company’s fixed assets include plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Company’s plants, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2020, the Company operated a total of approximately 480 plants, warehouses and offices of which (a) the locations in the U.S. had approximately 3.9 million square feet, of which approximately 2.0 million square feet were leased; (b) the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 17.6 million square feet, of which approximately 13.6 million square feet were leased; and (c) the square footage by segment was approximately 20.2 million square feet and approximately 1.3 million square feet for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and the Cable Products and Solutions segment, respectively. Of the total plants, warehouses and offices operated by the Company, approximately 200 are manufacturing facilities with over 10,000 square feet, of which approximately half are ISO 14001 certified. ​The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities. ​Item 3. Legal Proceedings​Information with respect to legal proceedings and this item is included in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.​Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures​Not applicable.​​21 Table of ContentsPART II​Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities​Market Information​The Company effected the initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) in November 1991. The Company’s Common Stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under the ticker symbol “APH”. As of January 31, 2021, there were 32 holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock. A significant number of outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms. The Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock. ​Stock Split​On January 27, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split will be effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2021. The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on March 4, 2021. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma effect of this stock split as if it had been effective for all years presented.​Stock Performance Graph​The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return of Amphenol over a period of five years ending December 31, 2020 with the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) Stock Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components & Equipment Index.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 6.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $641.3 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases in 2020, 1.4 million shares, or $153.9 million, have been retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase; the remaining 4.6 million shares, or $487.4 million, have been retired by the Company. From January 1, 2021 through January 31, 2021, the Company repurchased $4.0 million of its Common Stock, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $199.8 million of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the level of uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.​The table below reflects the Company’s stock repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​Total Number of​Maximum Dollar​(dollars in millions, except price per share)​​​​​​Shares Purchased as​Value of Shares​​​Total Number​Average​Part of Publicly​that May Yet be​​​of Shares​Price Paid​Announced Plans or​Purchased Under the​Period​Purchased per Share Programs Plans or Programs​First Quarter - 2020​ 2,692,461​$ 95.54​ 2,692,461​$ 587.9​Second Quarter - 2020​ —​​ —​ —​​ 587.9​Third Quarter - 2020​ 1,869,448​​ 108.01​ 1,869,448​​ 385.9​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fourth Quarter - 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​October 1 to October 31, 2020 193,338​ 113.77 193,338 ​ 363.9​November 1 to November 30, 2020 778,155​ 123.31 778,155 ​ 268.0​December 1 to December 31, 2020 486,227​ 132.07 486,227 ​ 203.8​​​ 1,457,720​​ 124.97​ 1,457,720​​ 203.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total - 2020 6,019,629​$ 106.54 6,019,629 $ 203.8​​​23 Table of Contents​​Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)​The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meanings, respectively, as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.​In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​Overview​General​Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions. In 2020, approximately 71% of the Company’s sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are:​●information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;●a broad range of industrial applications and traditional, hybrid and electric automotive applications; and●military and commercial aerospace applications.​The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers around the world. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.​Strategy​The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.​​25 Table of ContentsThe Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:​●Pursue broad diversification;●Develop high technology performance-enhancing interconnect solutions;●Expand global presence;●Control costs;●Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and●Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management.​In 2020, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $8,598.9, $1,638.4 and $1,203.4, respectively, representing an increase of 5%, 1% and 4%, respectively, from 2019. In 2020, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $42.8 resulting from stock option exercises and (b) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, partially offset by (c) acquisition-related expenses of $11.5 ($10.7 after-tax) primarily comprised of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. In 2019, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $38.1 resulting from stock option exercises, partially offset by (b) acquisition-related expenses of $25.4 ($21.0 after-tax) primarily from the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog as well as external transaction costs and (c) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt of $14.3 ($12.5 after-tax), comprised primarily of the premiums and other fees incurred from the early extinguishment of redeemed amounts of our 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes resulting from the tender offers in September 2019 described herein under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities”. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled in Part II, Item 7 herein, was unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations (“Operating Cash Flow”). The Company uses Operating Cash Flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2020, the Company generated Operating Cash Flow of $1,592.0 and Free Cash Flow of $1,327.9. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7 herein.​Impact of Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) on our Operations, Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations​The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to our Company during 2020, particularly during the first half of the year. During the first quarter, these disruptions were primarily limited to our operations in China, which were closed for three weeks during January and February due to government mandates. As the virus spread to the rest of the world beginning in March and continuing throughout the remainder of 2020, most of our other operations outside of China were also impacted. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, we expect those disruptions to continue through the first half of 2021 and they could, potentially, extend for the full year and beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include, depending on the specific location, government regulations that limit our ability to operate certain of our facilities at full capacity and to adjust certain costs, travel restrictions, “work-from-home” orders, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, and reduced demand from certain customers. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, in several regions around the world, including the United States and Europe, there has been a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability and effectiveness of vaccines, some of which have recently been approved and distributed for use, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. The Company continues taking actions to mitigate, as best we can, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of our employees, the communities in which we operate and our partners, as well as the impact on our operations and business as a whole. However, there can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.​26 Table of ContentsResults of Operations​The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​​ 2020 ​2019 ​2018 ​Net sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​Cost of sales 69.0​​ 68.2​​ 67.6​​Acquisition-related expenses 0.1​​ 0.3​​ 0.1​​Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.8​​ 11.8​​ 11.7​​Operating income 19.1​​ 19.7​​ 20.6​​Interest expense (1.3)​​ (1.4)​​ (1.2)​​Loss on early extinguishment of debt​ —​​ (0.2)​​ —​​Other income, net —​​ 0.1​​ —​​Income before income taxes 17.8​​ 18.2​​ 19.4​​Provision for income taxes (3.7)​​ (4.1)​​ (4.5)​​Net income 14.1​​ 14.1​​ 14.9​​Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.1)​​ (0.1)​​ (0.2)​​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 14.0% ​ 14.0% ​ 14.7% ​​2020 Compared to 2019​Net sales were $8,598.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,225.4 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currencies, and 2% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. The increase in net sales in 2020 was driven by strong growth in several markets, which was partially offset by the sudden and severe slowdown in certain of our markets resulting from the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also caused production disruptions in many parts of the world during much of the first half of 2020. ​Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currencies, and 2% organically, in 2020 compared to 2019. The sales growth was driven by strong growth in the industrial, information technology and data communications, and mobile devices markets, along with moderate growth in the military market, and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was partially offset by declines in the commercial aerospace, mobile networks and automotive markets, all of which were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $246.4), primarily driven by strength in battery and electric vehicle, industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment, alternative energy and medical applications, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $234.0), driven primarily by strong sales growth to data center customers and market demand for storage and networking related products as customers worked to support higher demand for increased bandwidth to support work, school and entertainment activities during the pandemic, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $179.9), driven by strength in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearable devices, and accessories along with production-related products, which was partially offset by a slight moderation of sales into smartphones. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $32.2), driven by strength across multiple segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of pandemic-related production disruptions experienced during the first half of the year. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased significantly (approximately $135.3) primarily due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $98.5), which reflected the impact of the 2019 U.S. Government restrictions on certain Chinese customers as well as reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, partially as a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset in part by contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $86.0), due to a significant reduction in demand resulting from customer factory shutdowns together with production disruptions in the first half of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by a strong recovery of demand during the second half of the year. ​Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 4% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 4% in U.S. dollars, 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was largely driven by the 27 Table of Contentsnegative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily during the first half of 2020, as well as an overall weakness in market demand.​The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage Growth (relative to prior year)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net sales​Foreign​Constant​​​Organic​​​​​growth in​currency​Currency Net​Acquisition​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​U.S. Dollars (1)​impact (2)​ Sales Growth (3)​impact (4)​Growth (3)​​ 2020 2019​(GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​Net sales: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interconnect Products and Assemblies​$ 8,229.9 $ 7,840.3​ 5% ​ 1% ​ 4% ​ 2% ​ 2% ​Cable Products and Solutions​ 369.0​ 385.1​ (4)% ​ (3)% ​ (1)% ​ —% ​ (1)% ​Consolidated​$ 8,598.9​$ 8,225.4​ 5% ​ 1% ​ 4% ​ 2% ​ 2% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the accompanying financial statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales.(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. ​Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2020 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($2,494.0 in 2020 versus $2,524.7 in 2019) and 5% organically, compared to 2019. Foreign sales in 2020 increased approximately 7% in U.S. dollars ($6,104.9 in 2020 versus $5,700.7 in 2019), 7% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to 2019, driven by strong growth in Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2019.​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,014.2 or 11.8% of net sales for 2020, compared to $971.4 or 11.8% of net sales for 2019. Administrative expenses increased approximately $27.5 in 2020, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2020 and 4.7% of net sales in 2019. Research and development expenses increased approximately $26.5 in 2020 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 3.0% of net sales in 2020 and 2.8% of net sales in 2019. Selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately $11.2 in 2020 compared to 2019, and represented approximately 4.0% of net sales in 2020 and 4.3% of net sales in 2019.​Operating income was $1,638.4 or 19.1% of net sales in 2020, compared to $1,619.2 or 19.7% of net sales in 2019. Operating income for 2020 included acquisition-related expenses of $11.5, primarily comprised of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. Operating income for 2019 included acquisition-related expenses of $25.4, comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with the acquired backlog resulting from two of our 2019 acquisitions, with the remainder representing external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses in 2020 and 2019 had the effect of decreasing net income by $10.7 or $0.03 per share, and $21.0 or $0.07 per share, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,649.9 or 19.2% of net sales, respectively, in 2020 and $1,644.6 or 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2019. ​Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2020 was $1,741.2 or 21.2% of net sales, compared to $1,722.7 or 22.0% of net sales in 2019. The decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the significant incremental costs incurred, primarily during the first half of 2020, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease in the operating margin during the first half of 2020 was partly offset by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes during the second half of 2020.​28 Table of ContentsOperating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2020 was $35.4 or 9.6% of net sales, compared to $39.5 or 10.2% of net sales in 2019. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower volumes as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily during the first half of 2020.​Interest expense was $115.4 in 2020 compared to $117.6 in 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.​Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $14.3 in 2019, which related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in September 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section within this Item 7 for further information related to the Tendered Notes.​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 20.5% in 2020 and 22.2% in 2019. Provision for income taxes in 2020 included (i) excess tax benefits of $42.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, which was partially offset by the tax effect related to acquisition-related expenses during the year, each of which had an impact on the effective tax rate and earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2019 included excess tax benefits of $38.1 from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by the tax effects related to (i) acquisition-related expenses during the year and (ii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, each of which had an impact on the effective tax rate and earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% for both 2020 and 2019, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $1,203.4 and $3.91, respectively, for 2020, compared to $1,155.0 and $3.75, respectively, for 2019. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,151.4 and $3.74, respectively, for 2020, compared to $1,150.4 and $3.74, respectively, for 2019.​The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020​2019​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPS​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 1,638.4 19.1% $ 1,203.4​ 20.5% $ 3.91​$ 1,619.2 19.7% $ 1,155.0​ 22.2% $ 3.75Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 11.5​ 0.1​​ 10.7​ (0.1)​​ 0.03​​ 25.4​ 0.3​​ 21.0​ (0.1)​​ 0.07Loss on early extinguishment of debt​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -​​ -​ -​​ 12.5​ (0.1)​​ 0.04Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ -​ -​​ (42.8)​ 2.8​​ (0.14)​​ -​ -​​ (38.1)​ 2.5​​ (0.12)Discrete tax item​​ -​ -​​ (19.9)​ 1.3​​ (0.06)​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -Adjusted (non-GAAP)​$ 1,649.9​ 19.2% $ 1,151.4​ 24.5% $ 3.74​$ 1,644.6​ 20.0% $ 1,150.4​ 24.5% $ 3.74​(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.​​29 Table of Contents2019 Compared to 2018​Net sales were $8,225.4 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was flat in U.S. dollars, an increase of 2% in constant currencies and a decrease of 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. ​Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in constant currencies, while decreasing 3% organically, in 2019 compared to 2018. The sales growth was driven by strong growth in the military and commercial aerospace markets as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was largely offset by reductions in the communications-related markets, in particular the mobile devices market, along with the negative effect of currency translation. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $181.0), driven by broad-based strength across essentially all segments including military vehicle, rotorcraft, and military airframe applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $48.7) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $66.1), primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions, as well as strength in medical and factory automation applications, which were partially offset by moderations in industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment and transportation, as well as other applications. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $38.0), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions, which were partially offset by moderations in demand due to the slowing of the worldwide automotive market. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market slightly increased (approximately $5.6), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions and organic growth of sales to data center customers, offset by moderations in market demand for storage and networking related products. Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased (approximately $277.5), driven by moderations in sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $10.2), due to reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, offset in part by contributions from acquisitions. ​Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 7% organically in 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand from broadband service providers.​The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage Growth (relative to prior year)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net sales​Foreign​Constant​​​Organic​​​​​growth in​currency​Currency Net​Acquisition​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​U.S. Dollars (1)​impact (2)​ Sales Growth (3)​impact (4)​Growth (3)​​ 2019 2018​(GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​Net sales: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interconnect Products and Assemblies​$ 7,840.3 $ 7,781.9​ 1% ​ (1)% ​ 2% ​ 5% ​ (3)% ​Cable Products and Solutions​ 385.1​ 420.1​ (8)% ​ (2)% ​ (6)% ​ 1% ​ (7)% ​Consolidated​$ 8,225.4​$ 8,202.0​ —% ​ (2)% ​ 2% ​ 5% ​ (3)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the accompanying financial statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales.(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. ​Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2019 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,524.7 in 2019 versus $2,241.4 in 2018) and 4% organically, compared to 2018. Foreign sales in 2019 decreased approximately 4% in U.S. dollars ($5,700.7 in 2019 versus $5,960.6 in 2018), 2% in constant currencies and 6% organically, compared to 2018, driven by moderations in Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $125.8, compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2018.30 Table of Contents​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $971.4 or 11.8% of net sales for 2019, compared to $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018. Administrative expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in both years. Research and development expenses increased approximately $13.3 in 2019 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2019 and 2.7% of net sales in 2018. Selling and marketing expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in both years.​Operating income was $1,619.2 or 19.7% of net sales in 2019, compared to $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018. Operating income for 2019 included acquisition-related expenses of $25.4, comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with the acquired backlog resulting from two of our 2019 acquisitions, with the remainder representing external transaction costs. Operating income for 2018 included acquisition-related expenses of $8.5, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,644.6 or 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2019 and $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales, respectively, in 2018. ​Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2019 was $1,722.7 or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales in 2018. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. ​Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 was $39.5 or 10.2% of net sales, compared to $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales in 2018. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.​Interest expense was $117.6 in 2019 compared to $101.7 in 2018. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels and the higher average interest rate associated with the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019 (the net proceeds of which, along with commercial paper borrowings, were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes also in January 2019). ​Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $14.3 in 2019, which related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes as a result of the tender offers in September 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section within this Item 7 for further information related to the Tendered Notes. ​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 22.2% in 2019 and 23.4% in 2018. Provision for income taxes in 2019 included excess tax benefits of $38.1 from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by the tax effects related to (i) acquisition-related expenses during the year and (ii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, each of which had an impact on the effective tax rate and earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2018 included (i) excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting of the income tax charge (“Tax Act Charge”) associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which were partially offset by the tax effect related to acquisition-related expenses during the year, each of which had an impact on the effective tax rate and earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. These items had the aggregate effect of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% and 25.5% for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $1,155.0 and $3.75, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,150.4 and $3.74, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018.​31 Table of ContentsThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019​2018​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation​Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 1,619.2 19.7% $ 1,155.0​ 22.2% $ 3.75​$ 1,686.9 20.6% $ 1,205.0​ 23.4% $ 3.85Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 25.4​ 0.3​​ 21.0​ (0.1)​​ 0.07​​ 8.5​ 0.1​​ 7.2​ -​​ 0.02Loss on early extinguishment of debt​​ -​ -​​ 12.5​ (0.1)​​ 0.04​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ -​ -​​ (38.1)​ 2.5​​ (0.12)​​ -​ -​​ (19.8)​ 1.2​​ (0.06)Tax Act Charge (benefit)​​ -​ -​​ -​ -​​ -​​ -​ -​​ (14.5)​ 0.9​​ (0.04)Adjusted (non-GAAP)​$ 1,644.6​ 20.0% $ 1,150.4​ 24.5% $ 3.74​$ 1,695.4​ 20.7% $ 1,177.9​ 25.5% $ 3.77​(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.​Liquidity and Capital Resources​Liquidity and Cash Requirements​At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,738.1 and $908.6, respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was located outside of the United States. The Company used approximately $145, net of cash acquired, of its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 to fund two acquisitions in January 2021. The Company also expects to fund the anticipated acquisition of MTS (as defined below) by the middle of 2021, through a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with borrowings under our existing revolving credit or commercial paper facilities, as discussed in more detail later within this Item 7. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs and the Revolving Credit Facility (each defined below). ​Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax (“Transition Tax”) on all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted and finalized in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. ​As a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017, the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company indicated its intention to distribute certain 2019 and 2018 foreign earnings, respectively, and accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2019 and 2018 foreign earnings, respectively. The Company intends to distribute certain 2020 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate as of December 31, 2020, and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2020 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2020 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign 32 Table of Contentsearnings of approximately $900 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. ​The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of the 2025 Senior Notes in February 2020 and the 2026 Euro Notes in May 2020, each as defined and discussed further within this Item 7), provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.​The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, the MTS acquisition, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes (including the 3.125% Senior Notes due in September 2021), and to the extent of any amounts outstanding, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2021 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.​Cash Flow Summary​The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​ 2020 2019 2018Net cash provided by operating activities ​$ 1,592.0​$ 1,502.3​$ 1,112.7Net cash used in investing activities ​ (333.5)​ (1,228.8)​ (441.8)Net cash used in financing activities ​ (516.6)​ (648.4)​ (1,070.1)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents ​ 68.9​ (13.2)​ (40.6)Net change in cash and cash equivalents ​$ 810.8​$ (388.1)​$ (439.8)​Operating Activities​The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) was $1,592.0 for 2020, compared to $1,502.3 for 2019 and $1,112.7 for 2018. The increase in Operating Cash Flow for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the increase in net income, along with a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below. The increase in Operating Cash Flow for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. Operating Cash Flow in 2018 also reflected the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans was made in 2019. ​In 2020, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $38.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $146.3, $102.0 and $88.6, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $204.3 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $93.7. In 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $81.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $129.3 and accounts payable of $60.2, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $117.3. In 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $237.9, 33 Table of Contents$173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. ​The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Accounts receivable increased $215.2 to $1,951.6 primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, along with the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 72 days and 73 days, respectively. Inventories increased $152.1 to $1,462.2, primarily to support higher sales levels, along with the effect of Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 79 days and 80 days, respectively. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $82.8 to $338.9, primarily due to increases in certain prepaid expenses and other current receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $55.6 to $1,054.6, primarily due to capital expenditures of $276.8 and Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $252.7 and disposals. Goodwill increased $165.0 to $5,032.1, primarily as a result of Translation, as well as goodwill recognized related to two acquisitions that closed in 2020. Other intangible assets, net, decreased $44.5 to $397.5 primarily due to the amortization of $49.6 related to the Company’s intangible assets. Other long-term assets increased $56.1 to $352.3, primarily due to an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets, along with an increase in deferred tax assets. Accounts payable increased $253.9 to $1,120.7, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, along with Translation. Payable days at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 61 days and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $90.7 to $953.3, primarily as a result of an increase in accrued salaries and wages and other accrued expenses, partly offset by the contingent consideration payment (related to the SSI acquisition) of $75.0 in June 2020, a deferred purchase price payment in the third quarter of $16.2, and a decrease in accrued income taxes, primarily resulting from U.S. federal tax payments. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $29.8 to $228.6, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the pension liabilities, partially offset by benefit payments. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased $21.9 to $706.3, primarily as a result of an increase in deferred tax liabilities.​In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $6.5, $6.6 and $88.3, respectively. In 2018, approximately $81.0 of the contributions in that year related to the January 2018 voluntary cash contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the Company’s U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, as discussed in more detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in capital expenditures. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2020 2019 2018Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) $ 1,592.0 $ 1,502.3 $ 1,112.7Capital expenditures (GAAP)​ (276.8)​ (295.0)​ (310.6)Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (GAAP)​ 12.7​ 7.4​ 5.0Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)​$ 1,327.9​$ 1,214.7​$ 807.1​Investing Activities​Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions. ​Net cash used in investing activities was $333.5 in 2020, compared to $1,228.8 in 2019 and $441.8 in 2018. In 2020, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $264.1, the use of $50.4 to fund acquisitions, and net purchases of short-term investments of $18.4. In 2019, net cash used in 34 Table of Contentsinvesting activities was driven primarily by the use of $937.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $287.6, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.8. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 to fund acquisitions, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $22.7.​Financing Activities​Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. ​Net cash used in financing activities was $516.6 in 2020, compared to $648.4 in 2019 and $1,070.1 in 2018. In 2020, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $641.3, (ii) the repayments of $404.4 associated with the Company’s 2.20% U.S. Senior Notes due April 2020 and other debt, (iii) net repayments of $385.8 related to the Company’s commercial paper programs, (iv) dividend payments of $297.6, (v) payment of $75.0 related to acquisition-related contingent consideration, (vi) payment of $16.2 associated with the deferred purchase price related to an acquisition, (vii) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $14.9, (vii) payments of costs of $8.7 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Euro Notes (each as defined below), and (viii) net repayments under the Company’s credit facilities of $0.7, partially offset by (i) net cash proceeds from both the February 2020 issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes and the May 2020 issuance of the 2026 Euro Notes of $942.3 and (ii) cash proceeds of $385.7 from the exercise of stock options. In 2019, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) the aggregate repayments of $1,111.5 associated with certain of the Company’s senior notes (the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) and other long-term debt, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $601.7, (iii) dividend payments of $279.5, (iv) net repayments of $229.0 associated with the Company’s commercial paper programs, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $43.3, (vi) payments of costs of $14.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2029 Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined below), and (vii) premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by (i) aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes of $1,398.8 and (ii) cash proceeds of $246.1 from the exercise of stock options. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $935.2, (ii) net repayments of $559.8 associated with commercial paper and other debt, (iii) dividend payments of $253.7, (iv) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and (v) payments of costs of $5.6 related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the 2028 Euro Notes and Euro Commercial Paper Program (each defined below), partially offset by (i) net cash proceeds of $571.7 from the October 2018 issuance of the 2028 Euro Notes and (ii) cash proceeds of $130.7 from the exercise of stock options.​The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, the Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. ​On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its existing $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, gives the Company the ability to borrow, in various currencies, at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. ​The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). As of December 31, 2020, there were no USCP Notes outstanding.​In July 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (collectively, the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), 35 Table of Contentswhich are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. dollars or other currencies. In addition, effective April 14, 2020, a subsidiary of the Company is able to issue ECP Notes through the Bank of England’s COVID Corporate Financing Facility (the “BOE Facility”). The BOE Facility will be available until March 22, 2021, although the Company has no current intentions to borrow under the BOE Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no ECP Notes outstanding, including under the BOE Facility.​Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,500.0, consistent with the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.​On March 20, 2020, the Company, through one of its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, borrowed $100.0 (the maximum borrowing capacity) on an uncommitted line of credit, at a variable LIBOR-based interest rate, initially set at 1.92%. This line of credit, which was guaranteed by the Company and carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points, expired on December 19, 2020. Borrowings under this line of credit arrangement were used for general corporate purposes. Prior to maturity, on May 5, 2020, the Company repaid, in full, the outstanding borrowing on this uncommitted line of credit, using cash and cash equivalents on hand. ​As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:​​​​​​​Principal Interest ​Amount Rate​Maturity$ 227.7 3.125% September 2021​ 295.0 4.00% February 2022​ 350.0 3.20% April 2024​ 400.0 2.050% March 2025​ 500.0 4.350% June 2029​ 900.0 2.80% February 2030​​​​​​€ 500.0​0.750% May 2026 (Euro Notes)​ 500.0 2.00% October 2028 (Euro Notes)​On February 20, 2020, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.050% Senior Notes due March 1, 2025 at 99.829% of face value (the “2025 Senior Notes”). On April 1, 2020, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2025 Senior Notes to repay the $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 upon maturity.​On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.​On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”). On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers. The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt 36 Table of Contentsand $3.1 of accrued interest. The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of December 31, 2020. ​On September 10, 2019, the Company issued $900.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.800% Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 at 99.920% of face value (the “2030 Senior Notes”). In September 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes to fund the cash consideration payable in the Tender Offers, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. ​All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (the “U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2021 Senior Notes are due in September 2021 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.​On May 4, 2020, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $545.4 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 0.750% Senior Notes due May 4, 2026 at 99.563% of face value (the “2026 Euro Notes” or “0.750% Euro Senior Notes”). The Company used the net proceeds from the 2026 Euro Notes to repay amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility.​On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”, collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes, “Euro Notes”, and collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes and the U.S. Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. ​The Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on each series of Euro Notes is payable annually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Euro Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions.​The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.​In April 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 6.0 million, 6.5 million and 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $641.3, $601.7 and $553.2, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases in 2020, 1.4 million shares, or $153.9, have been retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase; the remaining 4.6 million shares, or $487.4, have been retired by the Company. Of the total repurchases in 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, were retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase; the remaining 5.5 million shares, or $514.1, were retired by the Company. Of the total repurchases in 2018, 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, were retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase; the remaining 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, were retired by the Company. From January 1, 2021 through January 31, 2021, the Company repurchased $4.0 of its Common Stock, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $199.8 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the level of uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. ​37 Table of ContentsIn January 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, all of which were retired by the Company; these repurchases completed the $1,000.0 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 10.6 million shares for $935.2 during the year ended December 31, 2018.​Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On October 20, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.25 per share to $0.29 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2020. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2020​2019​2018First Quarter​$ 0.25​$ 0.23​$ 0.19Second Quarter​​ 0.25​​ 0.23​​ 0.23Third Quarter​​ 0.25​​ 0.25​​ 0.23Fourth Quarter​​ 0.29​​ 0.25​​ 0.23Total​$ 1.04​$ 0.96​$ 0.88​The following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2020​2019​2018Dividends declared​$ 310.0​$ 285.3​$ 264.3Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)​ 297.6​ 279.5​ 253.7​LIBOR Transition​In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On December 4, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration published a consultation on its intention to extend the publication of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”) rates until June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (the “SOFR”) as its preferred benchmark alternative to USD LIBOR. The SOFR represents a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is calculated based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. In March 2020, in response to this transition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance providing certain optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued by reference rate reform, and addresses operational issues likely to arise in modifying contracts to replace discontinued reference rates with new rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued further clarifying guidance surrounding derivatives, as it relates to this transition. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of LIBOR from both a risk management and financial reporting perspective. Our current portfolio of debt and financial instruments currently tied to LIBOR consists primarily of our Revolving Credit Facility, which had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020. Due to our current limited reliance on borrowings tied to LIBOR, the Company does not currently believe that this transition will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​Pensions​The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. The majority of U.S. employees are not covered by the U.S. Plans and are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations associated with the Company’s underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2020 to $211.0 from $184.8 in 2019 primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates on our projected benefit obligation, which was partially offset by actual returns on plan assets. In 2018, the Company also 38 Table of Contentsmade a voluntary cash contribution of $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. ​Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.​Acquisitions​During 2020, the Company completed two acquisitions for $50.4, net of cash acquired. The 2020 acquisitions were included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. During 2019, the Company completed nine acquisitions (including the January 2019 acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies) for $937.4, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions in 2019 were included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. These 2019 acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company.​On December 9, 2020, Amphenol announced that the Company entered into a definitive agreement under which Amphenol will acquire MTS Systems Corporation (Nasdaq: MTSC) (“MTS”) for $58.50 per share in cash, or approximately $1,700, net of cash acquired and including the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities. MTS, which is headquartered in the state of Minnesota in the United States, is a leading global supplier of precision sensors, advanced test systems and motion simulators. MTS is organized into two business segments: Sensors and Test & Simulation. The Sensors segment represents a highly complementary offering of high-technology, harsh environment sensors sold into diverse end markets and applications. The Company expects the MTS acquisition to further expand our range of sensor and sensor-based products across a wide array of industries. The definitive agreement to acquire MTS has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close by the middle of 2021, subject to certain regulatory approvals, approval from MTS’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions. Amphenol expects to fund the MTS acquisition through a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with borrowings under our existing revolving credit or commercial paper facilities. ​On January 19, 2021, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the MTS Test & Simulation business to Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW). The sale of this business is expected to close following the anticipated closing of our acquisition of MTS, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.​In January 2021, the Company also completed two acquisitions, each in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, for approximately $145, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions, which were funded using cash and cash equivalents on hand, are not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results. ​For further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​Stock Split​On January 27, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split will be effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2021. The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on March 4, 2021. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma effect of this stock split as if it had been effective for all years presented.​Environmental Matters​Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​39 Table of ContentsInflation and Costs​The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. For a discussion of certain risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels” in Part I, Item 1A herein.​Foreign Exchange​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein.​Non-GAAP Financial Measures​In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company’s Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in the presentation of such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. ​The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: ​●Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.​●Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.40 Table of Contents​●Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income).​●Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amphenol’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.​●Free Cash Flow is defined as (i) Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less (ii) capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), all of which are derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.​●Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of (i) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and (ii) acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. ​Recent Accounting Pronouncements​Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including those adopted by the Company.​​Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates​The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes that the most significant areas involving critical accounting policies are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​Revenue Recognition ​Topic 606​The Company’s net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with 41 Table of ContentsCustomers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”), resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of Topic 606 applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. ​The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price. ​The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the products are pulled from consignment inventory. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. ​Income Taxes​Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $900 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. ​As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017, the Company recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated 42 Table of Contentswith the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The accounting associated with each of the provisional amounts was completed in 2018. Beginning in 2018, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.​Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments​The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2020, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations ​​ Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions)​Total​1 year​years​years​5 years Debt (1)​$ 3,894.3​$ 230.5​$ 296.3​$ 750.5​$ 2,617.0​Interest related to senior notes (1)​ 650.4​ 102.1​ 172.2​ 145.4​ 230.7​Operating leases (2)​ 246.8​ 72.7​ 85.8​ 45.2​ 43.1​Purchase obligations (3)​ 462.6​ 424.1​ 34.6​ 2.1​ 1.8​Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (4)​ 60.4​ 7.2​ 11.3​ 12.5​ 29.4​Transition tax (5)​ 97.6​ 15.8​ 45.4​ 36.4​ —​Total (6)​$ 5,412.1​$ 852.4​$ 645.6​$ 992.1​$ 2,922.0​​(1)The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2020, were approximately $4.6. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.​(2)The Company’s operating lease payments included in this table reflect the future minimum undiscounted fixed lease payments, which serve as the basis for calculating the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The table above excludes any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 842, due to their uncertainty. Finance leases are not material to the Company individually or in the aggregate and as such, have been excluded from the table above. ​(3)Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production.​(4)Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans, the most significant funded plan of which covers certain of its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2021. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $81.0 in 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans, while no such voluntary contribution was made in 2020 and 2019. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2021 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.​(5)As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on certain assumptions made upon the Company’s then current interpretation of the Tax Act. The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the provisional amount, and consequently completed its accounting and recorded an adjustment related to the Transition Tax. The amounts noted in the table above reflect the final Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions, and in accordance with the Tax Act, is to be paid over the eight year period starting in 2018. The third installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the third quarter of 2020. ​(6)As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded net liabilities of approximately $168.2 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid.​43 Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk​(amounts in millions)​The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.​Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations.​In May 2020, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (collectively, the “Euro Issuer”) issued €500.0 (approximately $545.4) principal amount of unsecured 0.750% senior notes (“2026 Euro Notes”) due May 4, 2026. In October 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% senior notes (“2028 Euro Notes” and collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes, the “Euro Notes”) due October 8, 2028. In July 2018, the Euro Issuer entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and collectively with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, “Commercial Paper Programs”). While the Euro Notes are denominated in Euros, any borrowings under the Company’s Euro Commercial Paper Program and Revolving Credit Facility may be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro. When borrowing in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of debt.​The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for exposures associated with (i) certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and (ii) the net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries from which we expect to repatriate earnings to the United States. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of such contracts was not material. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes, and our derivative financial instruments are with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments.​Interest Rate Risk​The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company currently has various fixed rate series of senior notes outstanding over various maturity dates, two of which were issued in 2020. In February 2020, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.050% Senior Notes due March 1, 2025, the net proceeds of which were used to repay the $400.0 principal amount of 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 upon maturity. In May 2020, the Euro Issuer issued the unsecured 0.750% 2026 Euro Notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.​While there were no such outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, and any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs, and therefore, the amount of outstanding borrowings subject to floating interest rates was not material. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $400, or 11% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, which related primarily to the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs, were subject to floating interest rates; the Company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2019 was 1.85% and (0.13)%, respectively. A 10% change in the interest rate at December 31, 2020 and 2019 under our Revolving Credit Facility or Commercial Paper Programs would not have a material effect on interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2021, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.44 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:56.903877

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​Our Strategy​The Company’s overall strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:​●Pursue broad market diversification - The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to participate wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any one particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”.​●Develop high-technology performance-enhancing solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships with customers across its diverse end markets. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect, antenna and sensor products, and have been developed across the Company’s end markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as antennas and sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.​●Expand global presence - The Company is strategically expanding and shifting its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships. As the Company’s global customers have grown their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs, the Company is continuing to expand and shift its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers. The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities, including new product development. 4 Table of ContentsThe Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities around the world.​●Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and performance, and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, working with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own. This mindset was particularly important in 2021 and 2022, as supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures accelerated.​●Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. As a result, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high-potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. We seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s position with customers across our diverse end markets, our leading technologies and our access to low-cost manufacturing around the world. In 2022, the Company invested approximately $288 million to fund two acquisitions, while in 2021, the Company invested approximately $1.5 billion (net of the proceeds received from the divestiture of MTS Systems Corporation’s (“MTS”) Test & Simulation business in December 2021) to fund seven acquisitions, including the acquisitions of MTS’s Sensors business in April 2021 and Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) in December 2021. Our acquisitions in 2022 and 2021 have strengthened our customer base and product offerings in many of our end markets and have brought a number of high-performing new management teams into the Company.​●Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure. Each general manager is incented to grow and develop their business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs. In addition, Amphenol’s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with their peers throughout the Company to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals. As the Company has grown, we have preserved this unique culture of entrepreneurship by ensuring that our executive organization can effectively drive the performance of and collaboration among our global general managers. The alignment of the Company’s businesses into three newly formed divisions, which represent the newly formed reportable segments effective January 1, 2022, reinforces this culture and clear accountability, and enhances the scalability of the Company’s entrepreneurial organization.​Markets​The Company sells products to customers in a diversified set of end markets.

Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us with the opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important asset of the Company.​For many years, customers have generally been consolidating their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining geographic flexibility and competitive prices. The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment. As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with customers to develop new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our 7 Table of Contentsportfolio of products. In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and performance and lower product lead-time and cost. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s sales, refer to the subsection titled “Risks Related to our End Markets” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​The Company’s products are sold to thousands of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in numerous countries throughout the world. The Company’s products are also sold to electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) companies, to original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and to service providers, including telecommunications network service providers and web service providers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales during either of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​The Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent representatives and a global network of electronics distributors. The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 18% and 17% of the Company’s net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition to product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, the Company uses key account managers to manage certain customer relationships on a global basis so that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.​Manufacturing​The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining, 3D printing, extruding, die casting, certain other manufacturing, automation and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for connectors, specialty and coaxial cable production, antenna and sensor fabrication. Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities operate under certification to management system standards of globally recognized, industry certification organizations. Our facilities are primarily certified to quality management systems, primarily ISO9001, but also may include ISO13485, AS9100, and IATF16949. In addition, approximately half of our facilities are also certified to environmental or occupational health and safety management systems, including ISO14001 and ISO45001.​The Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in approximately 40 countries around the world. Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and operational agility, as well as a deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our broad and balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to particular geographies. This has been evident throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as we were generally able to support our customers even if pandemic-related restrictions and other challenges were present in a particular geography. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers, while at the same time offering a level of resiliency and diversification against local risks and challenges that may emerge in any single geography.​The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to provide proximity and reliable service to customers, while also lowering production and logistics costs. Our strategy is to maintain strong cost and quality controls in our manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company evaluates and adjusts its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and attempts to maximize operating profitability as well as the return on capital investments. This strategy has been, and continues to be, critical to the Company’s ability to mitigate supply chain constraints and a higher inflationary environment, such as those experienced in 2021 and 2022. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis. To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established certain facilities near these major customers. The Company seeks to position its manufacturing and assembly facilities in order to serve local markets while coordinating, as appropriate, product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s global operations, refer to the subsection titled “Risks Related to our Global Operations” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Research and Development​The Company’s product development strategy is to rely on product design teams at each of our operating units around the world working collaboratively with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs. The Company generally focuses its research and 8 Table of Contentsdevelopment efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. At the end of 2022, our research, development and engineering efforts, which relate to the creation of new and improved products and processes, were supported by approximately 3,700 of our employees and were performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and product technologies.​Intellectual Property​We own a significant portfolio of patents that principally relate to mechanical, electrical, radio frequency, optical and electronic features of connector, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.​We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.​From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes with third parties regarding the Company’s or such third party’s intellectual property assets, particularly patents. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents, or by a third party’s successful enforcement of its patents against us or any of our products. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, refer to the risk factor titled “We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Raw Materials​The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials. The Company also purchases a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of its products. Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components or, if one source is used, the Company generally attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements. From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may include regulatory restrictions. These difficulties may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company. While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, in 2021 and 2022, there were supply chain and logistical challenges that impacted the global economy, including our Company, and caused and continue to cause supply constraints and commodity price increases on certain raw materials and components used by the Company in production, as well as decreased availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. As of December 31, 2022, while some of the supply chain and logistical challenges have eased, inflation continues to impact the cost of certain raw materials and components used by the Company. Given this environment, the Company may experience supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components in the future, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation. For a discussion of certain risks related to the availability of and dependence on raw materials and components, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. Information regarding our obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​9 Table of ContentsCompetition​The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Primary competitors include Aptiv, Belden, Carlisle, Commscope, Eaton, Foxconn, Glenair, HARTING, Hirose, HUBER+SUHNER, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Phoenix Contact, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity, Yazaki and 3M, among others. In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products. For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Backlog and Seasonality​The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $4.1 billion compared with backlog of approximately $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that nearly all of the Company’s backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand. Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year.​Cybersecurity​In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber incidents, the Company has a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. We perform risk assessments and penetration tests relating to cybersecurity and technology risks. We also conduct workforce training to instruct employees how to better identify cybersecurity concerns and to avoid actions that might inadvertently allow outsiders to access our systems. We have installed end point protection software on our Company-managed systems and workstations in an effort to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems. The Company’s annual internal audits also include procedures performed on the control environment related to our information security systems. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) maintains oversight responsibility relating to our information security and cybersecurity program, with assistance from the Audit Committee of the Board. At least annually, our senior leadership team (including the leaders of our Information Technology and Internal Audit teams) provides an update of our information security and cybersecurity program to the full Board. In addition, the Company maintains standard cybersecurity insurance. During the last three years, we have not experienced a material security breach and, as a result, we have not incurred any material expenses from such a breach. Furthermore, during such time, we have not been penalized or paid any amount under any information security breach settlement. For a discussion of certain risks related to cybersecurity, refer to the risk factor titled “Cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations and fines” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Environmental Matters​Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of certain risks related to environmental matters, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​10 Table of ContentsGovernment Regulation​As a global company, we are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing reporting obligations, interactions with government officials, performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. In addition, the Company and its products are subject to import and export regulations present in each of the various jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws and regulations, and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. The issuances of such licenses, in particular within the military market, are subject to complex laws and regulations that could change frequently and with limited notice, depending on the jurisdiction, geopolitical events or other factors. The Company has systems in place to apply for licenses and to maintain compliance with any such regulations. Separately, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions and trade embargoes.​For a discussion of certain risks related to government regulation, including export and import controls and sanctions, refer to the risk factors titled “The Company must comply with complex U.S. governmental export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes,” “Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks,” and “Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners,” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance​At Amphenol, we believe that making sustainable business choices, building strong relationships with our stakeholders and engaging in good corporate governance create long-term value for our Company. Whether through minimizing our and our partners’ environmental footprint, following humane labor practices, supporting the development and diversity of our global team, ensuring the strength and integrity of our supply chain or giving back to our communities, we have always believed that it is not just good stewardship, but good business to focus on the long-term sustainability of Amphenol. Throughout Amphenol, we have a shared commitment to create innovative products and enable technologies that improve the lives of people around the world, to support the well-being of our employees and communities and to sustain the health of our planet.​Sustainability Report​The Company publishes an annual sustainability report (“Sustainability Report”) to highlight our goals and areas of progress and success in sustainability matters, including climate-related topics. The Sustainability Report discusses our approach and progress on the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues most significant to our business, including ESG-related strategies, programs, goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to our stakeholders. The Sustainability Report is designed to inform and engage the Company’s broad range of ESG stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers, customers, governments, community members and investors, among others. Our 2021 Sustainability Report was prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards framework and topics identified as material under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and outlines board and executive-level oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities identified in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. The SASB standard and GRI and TCFD frameworks encourage companies to disclose climate-related topics that are important to certain interested stakeholders, even if not material for purposes of the U.S. securities laws. Furthermore, the materiality standards under these frameworks are different from the materiality standard under the U.S. securities laws. Our 2021 Sustainability Report is available on our website at https://amphenol.com/sustainability. The items discussed in our 2021 Sustainability Report have not required material capital expenditures or operating expenses, nor caused significant operational challenges or risks to the Company’s business or results of operations beyond those items disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors within the risk factors titled “The Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming,” “The Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change,” and “Increasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business”. Information included in our 2021 Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report. Our 2022 Sustainability Report is expected to be released during the second quarter of 2023.11 Table of Contents​Human Capital Management and Our Culture​The Company’s success is closely tied to the capability, adaptability and accountability of our diverse, global organization. One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization. We believe this structure, with approximately 130 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.​As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 91,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 11,000 were located in the United States. Less than 10% of Amphenol’s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees. ​Governance and Culture – Our Board is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture and ESG initiatives. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees. At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least once a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, compensation and culture. We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.​Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Amphenol is committed to workplace diversity and fostering a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging across our organization. Our business spans the globe, and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. At Amphenol, we promote and maintain a culture of respect and appreciation of differences in our employees. The Company generally relies on local management in every business unit to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community. A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders. Our core management team is comprised of these general managers and their controllers, as well as our executive management team. Women represented 27% of this core management team at the end of 2022. Of our total employees worldwide, approximately half are women.​Health, Safety and Well-being – We believe that the protection of our employees is a moral obligation. In addition, the safety and well-being of our employees is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team and are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces.​Compensation and Benefits – The Company is focused on providing our employees around the world equitable and competitive compensation and benefits. In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts. Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions.​Community and Social Impact – Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work. Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services. In 2022, a number of our operations in Europe supported refugees who were fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion.​​12 Table of ContentsAvailable Information​The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Amphenol, that file with the SEC. Any such documents that the Company files with the SEC can be obtained by the public on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. This Annual Report and all of the Company’s other filings with the SEC, such as quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are also available to view, free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.amphenol.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Also included on the Company’s website are press releases and other information about the Company’s financial results and performance, and information regarding ESG matters, among other information. Copies of this Annual Report are also available without charge, from Amphenol Corporation, Investor Relations, 358 Hall Avenue, Wallingford, CT 06492. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.​Item 1A. Risk Factors​The Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price can be negatively affected by many risk factors. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report. The Company’s past financial performance, including historical trends, should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently consider immaterial may materialize and impair the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or stock price. ​If actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company’s Common Stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.​RISKS RELATED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS​The Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.​The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. During 2022, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 67% of the Company’s net sales, with China constituting approximately 26% of the Company’s net sales. The Company employs nearly 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company’s customers are located throughout the world, and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. ​During the last few years there have also been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, sanctions, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade policies and tariffs affecting China. These changes have, in certain cases, increased our costs of doing business. The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing or could make it more difficult for us to sell our products in some markets. Other countries where we operate or sell our products have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s or other countries’ trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.​​13 Table of ContentsIn addition to the risks noted above, a number of other legal, economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations, such as:​●a global or regional economic slowdown or recession in any of the Company’s end markets (or a prolonging or intensification of such a slowdown or recession), which could negatively affect the financial condition of our customers and result in reduced demand;●postponement of customer spending, in response to tighter credit, inflationary pressures, financial market volatility and other global economic factors;●effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and/or fiscal policies in the United States and/or abroad, including interest rate changes by the U.S. Federal Reserve or other international central banking systems, foreign currency fluctuations, significant income tax changes and inflationary pressures;●intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including, but not limited to, armed conflict, trade wars, cyberattacks and acts of terrorism or war, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and escalating tensions in bordering countries within the Eurozone;●employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;●industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;●difficulties protecting intellectual property;●longer payment cycles;●changes in exchange control regulations, including any government actions that prohibit, limit or increase the cost of paying a dividend or otherwise moving cash between the Company’s subsidiaries located in different countries;●credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable; and●changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company’s benefit plans.​We may be negatively impacted by adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.​Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. These disruptions have included, and may continue to include, government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During much of 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in China resulted in local or regional government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, which impacted the ability of several of our operations and manufacturing facilities to operate in the ordinary course. As of December 31, 2022, there continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, particularly in China. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in the future.​The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing.​The Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third-party suppliers to secure these materials and components. While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, in 2021 and 2022, there were supply chain and logistical challenges that impacted the global economy, including our Company, and caused and continue to cause supply constraints and commodity price increases on certain raw materials and components used by the Company. In addition, recent inflationary pressures have been exacerbated by decreased availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. The Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers, and may not be able to procure and obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components at acceptable prices from our suppliers. Accordingly, any future delays, disruptions, and supply and pricing risks could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products or our profitability from selling those products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.14 Table of ContentsIn limited instances, we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. The cost and availability of raw materials may fluctuate significantly due to external factors including, but not limited to, product scarcity, disruptions caused by climate change and adverse weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, governmental policies and regulations such as trade tariffs and import restrictions, as well as pandemics and epidemics (such as, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic), which may, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.​Cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations and fines.​Cybersecurity threats and techniques used to disrupt operations and gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, including, but not limited to, malware, phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware and other increasingly sophisticated attacks, continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Globally, there continues to be an increased volume of cyber threats, ransomware attempts and social engineering attacks such as phishing and impersonation, and attackers increasingly use tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased cybersecurity risk as a result of global remote working dynamics that may continue into the future and present additional risk that threat actors will engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and exploit vulnerabilities in corporate and non-corporate networks. Ransomware attacks have become easier to execute, and with the rise of ransomware as a service, it has become an increasingly popular business model to lease or sell ransomware variants to anyone willing to pay the fee. ​The Company has been and expects to continue to be a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including, but not limited to, ransomware attacks. While the impact of such attacks has not been material, future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third-party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and/or misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information. Cybersecurity events could also result in the loss of or inability to access confidential information and critical business, financial or other data, and/or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. Despite providing training to employees as well as implementing preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our or key third-party information technology systems and infrastructure are still susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, security vulnerabilities or “bugs” in software or hardware, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, release of highly sensitive confidential information, the inability to access critical data and other operational disruption, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations and fines, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including financial information and current and future products under development, and also contains certain customer, supplier, partner and employee data, such as sensitive personal data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us. In addition, in certain cases, in order to conduct business, we outsource to third-party business partners. We generally obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to protect our data; nonetheless, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyberattack. Any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations, impact future business opportunities, harm our customers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities, including litigation or other enforcement actions.​15 Table of ContentsThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements, privacy laws and regulations around the world, for example, in the European Union, People’s Republic of China, and the state of California, which impose significant obligations for companies on how they collect, store, protect, process and transfer personal data and can impose significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with any existing and forthcoming information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results.​The Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming.​From time to time, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, portions of our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers, vendors, customers and distributors. Such unpredictable weather conditions and natural disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and stronger and longer-lasting weather patterns, and their consequences and effects have, in the past, temporarily disrupted our business operations both in the United States and abroad. These events could cause some of the Company’s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether, lost business and sales, changing costs or availability of insurance, and/or property damage or harm to our people, each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.​Increasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business.​Companies across industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Expectations regarding voluntary and potential mandatory ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs, changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, an inability to receive or maintain favorable ESG ratings could negatively impact our reputation or impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees or customers, which may adversely impact our operations. Unfavorable ESG ratings could also lead to increased negative investor sentiment towards us or our industry, which could negatively impact the share price of our Common Stock as well as our access to and cost of capital.​Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.​Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”). As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws.​There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures designed for complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements. Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.​16 Table of ContentsThe Company’s results can be positively or negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible foreign currency restrictions and/or devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. There can be no assurance that any or all actions taken by the Company to mitigate currency risk, such as locating factories in the same country or region in which products are sold, hedging contracts, cost reduction and pricing actions or working capital management, will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk. A significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​The Company is dependent on attracting, recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled employees, including our various management teams.​Our performance is dependent on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled personnel, including our executive and core management teams. Given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate, the ability to identify and attract new talent, as well as retain existing talent, may prove to be difficult. It is possible that the current labor market could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled employees, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our business could also be adversely impacted by the ongoing increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits.​RISKS RELATED TO OUR END MARKETS​The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business.​The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. Rapid technological changes could also lead to the entry of new competitors of various sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.​The Company is dependent on end market dynamics to sell its products, particularly in the communications, automotive and military end markets.​The Company is dependent on end market dynamics to sell its products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in any of these markets. Approximately 42% of the Company’s 2022 net sales came from sales to the communications industry. Demand for products in these markets is generally subject to rapid technological change and/or capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems, all of which could be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation. Approximately 21% of the Company’s net sales came from the automotive industry. The automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions. The communications and automotive end markets are also dominated by large customers that regularly exert price pressures on their suppliers, including the Company. Approximately 9% of the Company’s net sales came from sales to the military end market. Accordingly, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments, which are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. Periodic downturns in any of our customers’ end markets can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.​17 Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS​The Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.​The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including two in 2022. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including, but not limited to, managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In certain limited cases, the Company has pursued indemnification claims against seller(s) of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller(s) of any acquired business, such seller(s) may successfully contest such claims and/or may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. We cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits, margin improvements and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions.​The Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.​On December 31, 2022, the total assets of the Company were $15.3 billion, which included $6.4 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $734.1 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company’s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.​RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES​The Company’s credit agreements and senior notes contain certain requirements, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.​The second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which also backstops the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program (“U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) and Euro commercial paper program (“Euro Commercial Paper Program”), contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. The Company also has similar financial and other covenants associated with its two-year, $750.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “2022 Term Loan”) entered into in April 2022. In addition, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2022 Term Loan. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility or the 2022 Term Loan, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company’s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility, the 2022 Term Loan and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $632.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan and Euro Commercial Paper Program.​In addition to these credit agreements, the Company’s various senior notes also impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements. While the Company is compliant with all such requirements as of December 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with such requirements.18 Table of ContentsThe Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company’s results.​The Company has used the global capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to downgrade the Company’s credit rating, it would likely increase the Company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​The Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.​The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $640 million, or 14%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates, primarily from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. As a result of recent increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program increased substantially over the course of 2022, a trend that could continue throughout 2023. Consequently, the Company currently expects the floating interest rates related to its U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as its Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) to continue to increase in the first quarter of 2023 and potentially beyond, which is expected to result in increased interest expense in 2023 as compared to 2022. There can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.​RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS​Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks. ​We are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing reporting obligations, interactions with government officials, performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. We may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. and other foreign governments or their suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents from certain of the Company’s Military and Aerospace businesses pertaining to certain products that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. In connection with this investigation, during the third quarter of 2022, in a meeting with representatives of the U.S. government, it was alleged that the Company likely violated various provisions of federal law, including violations under the civil False Claims Act, as discussed more fully in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The U.S. laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. We are subject to a wide range of similar laws and regulations in other countries throughout the world. Failure, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.​In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If our contracts are terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, 19 Table of Contentswhich could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.​The Company must comply with complex U.S. governmental export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes.​Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws and regulations, and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions and trade embargoes that restrict our ability to transact or deal with certain persons, countries, regions, and governments. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent U.S. administrations, especially in light of recent tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company’s customers based in China to the “Entity List” maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Further, in 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry Security released new export control regulations that restrict the provision to China of certain technology, software, manufacturing equipment and commodities that are used to make certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”) and supercomputers. These changes include new restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to provide certain services to any facility in China that manufactures certain advanced ICs. Although, to date, none of such restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions, and such restrictions could further limit or prohibit the Company from selling its products or providing its services. In addition, we cannot ensure that our policies and procedures designed to maintain compliance with applicable rules and regulations will be effective in preventing instances of non-compliance. If we were to fail to comply with applicable export control restrictions (for example, by failing to obtain required export licensing), customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, reputational harm, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.​Changes in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results.​The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions, and, in addition, new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.​On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Companies will be required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but will not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT. The impact of these provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023, is dependent on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released.​Any future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations associated with the IRA or otherwise, could materially impact the Company’s current and non-current tax liabilities, along with deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.​We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.​We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and, from time to time, we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries 20 Table of Contentsoutside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in laws concerning intellectual property, or the enforcement of such laws, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.​The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties may include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. In addition, some foreign competitors may take advantage of the intellectual property laws in their home countries and the more favorable litigation and regulatory environment to our detriment. Third-party claims of infringement may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.​The Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.​The Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including, but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty, indemnity and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, voluntary or forced product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand.​While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not apply and, where insurance exists, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. In some cases, particularly with respect to product warranty claims from customers, we self-insure against this risk, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from Company funds and not by insurance. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.​The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.​The Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company’s former or current properties, either owned or leased. For example, as disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company was named as one of several defendants in four separate lawsuits filed in the State of Indiana relating to a manufacturing site in Franklin, Indiana where the Company has been conducting an environmental clean-up effort under the direction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. All the costs incurred by the Company relating to these lawsuits as well as all costs associated with the clean-up effort at the manufacturing site have been reimbursed by the former owner pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the Company’s business in 1987. Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise in any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other 21 Table of Contentspunitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.​The Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change.​There is increased public awareness regarding climate change. This increased focus has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts. In addition to the risks discussed under the risk factors titled “The Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming” and “Increasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business,” the Company may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations or orders, such as any laws or regulations to implement the Paris Climate Agreement, which seek to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In addition to government requirements, our customers are also increasingly imposing climate-related requirements on their suppliers, including us. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with these requirements may result in reduced demand for our products, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts to our business.​Given our global manufacturing presence, any future regulations relating to GHG emissions and/or other climate change-related laws and regulations, beyond initiatives already in process at the Company, could subject us to additional and/or unforeseen compliance costs and limitations, increased energy and raw material costs and incremental capital expenditure requirements. In addition, there may be additional mandatory climate-related reporting obligations, and potentially GHG emissions reduction requirements, which would likely result in increased corporate- and operational general and administrative efforts and associated costs and expenses.​Any future regulatory changes in any of the countries in which we operate could result in transition risks to the Company, including, but not limited to: (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way the Company operates, (ii) financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome, (iii) legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate change-related regulations, (iv) risks of climate litigation associated with our disclosures and/or operations; (v) risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (vi) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of the Company and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions, all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace.​​Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments​None.​22 Table of ContentsItem 2. Properties​The Company’s fixed assets include factories and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment. The Company’s factories, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2022, the Company operated approximately 240 manufacturing facilities with approximately 24.0 million square feet, of which approximately 17.0 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 4.0 million square feet, of which approximately 2.0 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located outside the U.S. had approximately 20.0 million square feet, of which approximately 15.0 million square feet were leased. The square footage by segment related to our manufacturing facilities was approximately 7.0 million square feet, 10.0 million square feet and 7.0 million square feet for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, Communications Solutions segment, and Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, respectively.​The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its business and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the relevant products. The Company regularly reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities. ​Item 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities​Market Information​The Company effected the initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) in November 1991. The Company’s Common Stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under the ticker symbol “APH”. As of January 31, 2023, there were 32 holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock. A significant number of outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms. The Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock. ​Stock Performance Graph​The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return of Amphenol over a period of five years ending December 31, 2022 with the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) Stock Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components & Equipment Index. This graph assumes that $100 was invested in our Common Stock and each index on December 31, 2017, reflects reinvested dividends, and is weighted on a market capitalization basis as of the beginning of each year.

The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance. ​​Dividends​Contingent upon declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.​24 Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the dividends declared per common share for each quarter of 2022 and 2021:​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021First Quarter​$ 0.20​$ 0.145Second Quarter​ 0.20​ 0.145Third Quarter​ 0.20​ 0.145Fourth Quarter​ 0.21​ 0.20Total​$ 0.81​$ 0.635​Dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions) were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​2022​2021Dividends declared​$ 482.6​$ 379.7Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)​ 477.4​ 346.7​Amphenol has a history of paying quarterly cash dividends. While the Company currently expects a cash dividend to be paid in the future, future dividend payments remain within the discretion of the Board and are dependent on our financial results, liquidity, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with financial covenants and requirements, and other factors considered relevant by the Board. ​Repurchase of Equity Securities​On April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 2.3 million and 9.9 million shares of its Common Stock for $170.4 million and $730.5 million, respectively, under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2022 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 9.3 million shares, or $689.7 million, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase. From January 1, 2023 through January 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $48.8 million, and, as of February 1, 2023, the Company has remaining authorization to purchase up to $762.8 million of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases will depend on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Common Stock.​The Company’s stock repurchases during the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars in millions, except price per share)​​​​​​Total Number of Shares​Maximum Dollar Value​​​Total Number​Average​Purchased as Part of​of Shares that May Yet be​​​of Shares​Price Paid​Publicly Announced​Purchased Under the​Period​Purchased per Share Plans or Programs Plans or Programs​First Quarter – 2022​ 2,627,497​$ 77.62​ 2,627,497​$ 1,338.1​Second Quarter – 2022​ 2,662,651​​ 69.85​ 2,662,651​​ 1,152.2​Third Quarter – 2022​ 2,355,646​​ 72.21​ 2,355,646​​ 982.1​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fourth Quarter – 2022:​​​​​​​​​​​October 1 to October 31, 2022 738,500​ 70.08 738,500 ​ 930.3​November 1 to November 30, 2022 810,218​ 77.74 810,218 ​ 867.3​December 1 to December 31, 2022 711,424​ 78.30 711,424 $ 811.6​​​ 2,260,142​​ 75.41​ 2,260,142​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total – 2022 9,905,936​$ 73.74 9,905,936 ​​​​​Item 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​(amounts in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)​The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein for Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”). Any references to the Company’s results in this Item 7 are specifically to our continuing operations only and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted. The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”. For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meaning, respectively, as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.​In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).​Overview​General​Amphenol is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. In 2022, approximately 67% of the Company’s sales were outside the United States. The primary end markets for our products are:​●information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;​●a broad range of industrial applications and traditional, hybrid and electric automotive applications; and​●military and commercial aerospace applications.​The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by a broad array of customers around the world. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. For many years, customers have generally been consolidating their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining geographic flexibility and competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment.

In 2022, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $56.0 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises, partially offset by (b) acquisition-related expenses of $21.5 ($18.4 after-tax) comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, 27 Table of Contentsalong with external transaction costs. In 2021, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $63.4 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises and (b) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by (c) acquisition-related expenses of $70.4 ($57.3 after-tax) comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”) in the second quarter of 2021 and external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7, increased by 20% and 20%, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow”). The Company uses Operating Cash Flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”), pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2022, the Company generated Operating Cash Flow of $2,174.6 and Free Cash Flow of $1,796.4. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7.​Impact of COVID-19 on our Business, Operations, Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations​Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. These disruptions have included, and may continue to include, government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During much of 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in China resulted in local or regional government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, which impacted the ability of several of our operations and manufacturing facilities to operate in the ordinary course. As of December 31, 2022, there continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, particularly in China, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable. For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Inflation Reduction Act of 2022​On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Companies will be required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but will not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT. The impact of these provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023, is dependent on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released. The Company has reviewed and assessed the provisions of the IRA, including several other non-tax related provisions, and the Company does not currently believe that the IRA will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.28 Table of ContentsResults of Operations​The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​​ 2022 ​2021 ​2020 ​Net sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​Cost of sales 68.1​​ 68.7​​ 69.0​​Acquisition-related expenses 0.2​​ 0.6​​ 0.1​​Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.3​​ 11.3​​ 11.8​​Operating income 20.5​​ 19.4​​ 19.1​​Interest expense (1.0)​​ (1.1)​​ (1.3)​​Other income (expense), net 0.1​​ —​​ —​​Income from continuing operations before income taxes 19.5​​18.3​​17.8​​Provision for income taxes (4.4)​​ (3.8)​​ (3.7)​​Net income from continuing operations 15.2​​ 14.5​​ 14.1​​Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests​ (0.1)​​ (0.1)​​ (0.1)​​Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation​ 15.1​​ 14.4​​ 14.0​​Income from discontinued operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation —​​ 0.2​​ —​​Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation 15.1% ​ 14.6% ​ 14.0% ​Note: Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.​2022 Compared to 2021​Net sales were $12,623.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $10,876.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in constant currencies and 15% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. The increase in net sales in 2022 was driven by robust growth across all three reportable business segments, as described below. From a market standpoint, the increase in net sales was driven by robust organic growth across most end markets, including the automotive, informational technology and data communications, industrial, broadband communications and commercial aerospace markets, moderate organic growth in the military, mobile networks and mobile devices markets, and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.

While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(3)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current reporting year compared to the prior reporting year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the prior year from current year net sales, taken as a percentage of the prior year’s net sales.(4)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7.(5)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current year and/or prior comparable year presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Acquisition impact is calculated as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales.(6)Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.​The increase in foreign net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by strong growth in both Europe and Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $359.8, compared to 2021.​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,420.9, or 11.3% of net sales for 2022, compared to $1,226.3, or 11.3% of net sales for 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 remained flat as the leverage on the higher sales volumes during the year was offset by the MTS Sensors business, acquired in early 2021, having higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased $90.6 in 2022, and represented approximately 4.6% of net sales in 2022 and 4.5% of net sales in 2021. Research and development expenses increased $5.9 in 2022 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.6% of net sales in 2022 and 2.9% of net sales in 2021. Selling and marketing expenses increased $98.1 in 2022 compared to 2021, and represented approximately 4.1% of net sales in 2022 and 3.8% of net sales in 2021.​​30 Table of ContentsOperating income was $2,585.8, or 20.5% of net sales in 2022, compared to $2,105.1, or 19.4% of net sales in 2021. Operating income in 2022 included acquisition-related expenses of $21.5, comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, along with external transaction costs. Operating income in 2021 included acquisition-related expenses of $70.4, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of MTS in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of Halo in the fourth quarter of 2021. The acquisition-related expenses in 2022 and 2021 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $18.4, or $0.03 per share, and $57.3, or $0.09 per share, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $2,607.3 and 20.7% of net sales, respectively, in 2022, and $2,175.5 and 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2021. The increases in Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2022 relative to 2021 was driven by all three segments, as described below.​Operating income for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment in 2022 was $801.6, or 25.8% of net sales, compared to $708.2, or 25.7% of net sales in 2021. The slight increase in operating margin for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, which were largely offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022. ​Operating income for the Communications Solutions segment in 2022 was $1,245.7, or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,023.3, or 21.2% of net sales in 2021. The increase in operating margin for the Communications Solutions segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022.​Operating income for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment in 2022 was $716.5, or 18.5% of net sales, compared to $588.1, or 17.9% of net sales in 2021. The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022.​Interest expense was $128.4 in 2022 compared to $115.5 in 2021. The increase in interest expense was driven by the rising interest rate environment and its impact on the balance outstanding under the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 22.3% in 2022 and 20.6% in 2021. Provision for income taxes in 2022 included excess tax benefits of $56.0 from stock option exercises, partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2021 included (i) excess tax benefits of $63.4 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, all of which was partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% and 24.3% for 2022 and 2021, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income from continuing operations per common share attributable to Amphenol Corporation-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $1,902.3 and $3.06, respectively, for 2022, compared to $1,569.4 and $2.51, respectively, for 2021. Excluding the effect of the items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,864.7 and $3.00, respectively, for 2022, compared to $1,548.4 and $2.48, respectively, for 2021.31 Table of ContentsThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all on a continuing operations basis only, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022​2021​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​ ​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) ​EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 2,585.8 20.5% $ 1,902.3​ 22.3% $ 3.06​$ 2,105.1 19.4% $ 1,569.4​ 20.6% $ 2.51Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 21.5​ 0.2​​ 18.4​ (0.1)​​ 0.03​​ 70.4​ 0.6​​ 57.3​ (0.2)​​ 0.09Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ —​ —​​ (56.0)​ 2.3​​ (0.09)​​ —​ —​​ (63.4)​ 3.2​​ (0.10)Discrete tax item​​ —​ —​​ —​ —​​ —​​ —​ —​​ (14.9)​ 0.7​​ (0.02)Adjusted (non-GAAP) (2)​$ 2,607.3​ 20.7% $ 1,864.7​ 24.5% $ 3.00​$ 2,175.5​ 20.0% $ 1,548.4​ 24.3% $ 2.48​Note: All data in the tables above are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude results associated with discontinued operations.​(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(2)All percentages and per share amounts in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.​​2021 Compared to 2020​Net sales were $10,876.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8,598.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in constant currencies and 18% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. The increase in net sales in 2021 was driven by robust growth across all three reportable business segments, as described below. From a market standpoint, the increase in net sales was driven by strong organic growth across nearly all end markets, including the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military and mobile networks markets, moderate growth in the mobile devices market, and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This strong sales growth in 2021 also reflected a recovery in certain markets from the more negative impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. This sales growth was partially offset by a decline in the commercial aerospace market, which continued to be negatively impacted by the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $864.6), with broad-based growth across nearly all market segments of the global industrial market, with particular strength in heavy equipment, factory automation, industrial instrumentation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, alternative energy, rail mass transit, and transportation, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $683.4), reflecting the continued recovery and growth in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as the Company’s expanded position in next-generation electronics, including in particular electric and hybrid drive trains. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $482.7), driven primarily by continued strong sales growth to web service providers and broad-based market demand for server, storage and networking related products as customers worked to support higher demand for increased bandwidth. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $135.8), driven by strength across nearly all segments of the military market, including missile, military communications and naval and space-related applications, along with a recovery from the impact of pandemic-related production disruptions experienced during the first half of 2020, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $60.5), driven by a recovery in demand from mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, which was primarily driven by increased demand for products used in 5G network build-outs and contributions from acquisitions, offset in part by reductions of sales to certain customers in China that were added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s “Entity List”. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $45.7), driven by growth in products incorporated into laptops and wearable devices, along with production-related products, and was partially offset by moderations of sales into smartphones and tablets. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased (approximately $26.6) primarily due to the continued significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production during that period.​​32 Table of ContentsNet sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment (approximately 25% of net sales) increased 20% in U.S. dollars, 19% in constant currencies and 15% organically, in 2021, compared to 2020.

The sales growth in 2021 was driven primarily by strong organic growth in the automotive, information technology and data communications, industrial and mobile networks markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, all of which was partially offset by a decline in the commercial aerospace market in that period.​The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment, geography and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage Growth (relative to prior year) (1)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Net sales​Foreign​Constant​​​Organic​​​​​growth in​currency​Currency Net​Acquisition​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​U.S. Dollars (2)​impact (3)​ Sales Growth (4)​impact (5)​Growth (4)​Net sales by: 2021 2020 (GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​(non-GAAP)​Segment: ​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Harsh Environment Solutions​$ 2,752.2 $ 2,286.0​ 20% ​ 2% ​ 19% ​ 4% ​ 15% ​Communications Solutions​​ 4,832.1​​ 4,056.2​ 19% ​ 1% ​ 18% ​ 2% ​ 16% ​Interconnect and Sensor Systems​ 3,292.0​ 2,256.7​ 46% ​ 3% ​ 43% ​ 17% ​ 26% ​Consolidated​$ 10,876.3​$ 8,598.9​ 26% ​ 2% ​ 25% ​ 6% ​ 18% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Geography (6): ​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​United States​$ 3,155.9 $ 2,494.0​ 27% ​ —% ​ 26% ​9% ​ 17% ​Foreign​ 7,720.4​ 6,104.9​ 26% ​ 2% ​ 24% ​5% ​ 19% ​Consolidated​$ 10,876.3​$ 8,598.9​ 26% ​ 2% ​ 25% ​6% ​ 18% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(1)Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.(2)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(3)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current reporting year compared to the prior reporting year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the prior year from current year net sales, taken as a percentage of the prior year’s net sales.(4)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7.(5)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current year and/or prior comparable year presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Acquisition impact is calculated as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales. (6)Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.​The increase in foreign net sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by strong growth in both Europe and Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $159.1, compared to 2020.​Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,226.3, or 11.3% of net sales for 2021, compared to $1,014.2, or 11.8% of net sales for 2020. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2021 was driven primarily by higher sales during the year, relative to 2020 which was more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, slightly offset by the impact of the MTS Sensors business, acquired in 2021, which has higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased $78.6 in 2021, and represented approximately 4.5% of net sales in 2021 and 4.8% of net sales in 2020. Research and development expenses increased $57.0 in 2021 primarily related to increases in 33 Table of Contentsexpenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.9% of net sales in 2021 and 3.0% of net sales in 2020. Selling and marketing expenses increased $76.5 in 2021 compared to 2020, and represented approximately 3.8% of net sales in 2021 and 4.0% of net sales in 2020.​Operating income was $2,105.1, or 19.4% of net sales in 2021, compared to $1,638.4, or 19.1% of net sales in 2020. Operating income in 2021 included acquisition-related expenses of $70.4, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the Halo acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating income in 2020 included acquisition-related expenses of $11.5, comprised primarily of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. These acquisition-related expenses in 2021 and 2020 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $57.3, or $0.09 per share, and $10.7, or $0.02 per share, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $2,175.5 and 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2021, and $1,649.9 and 19.2% of net sales, respectively, in 2020. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2021 relative to 2020 was driven by all three segments, and in particular, by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021, along with the impact of the Company’s 2021 acquisitions. ​Operating income for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment in 2021 was $708.2, or 25.7% of net sales, compared to $556.8, or 24.4% of net sales in 2020. The increase in operating margin for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity, logistics and supply chain environment experienced in 2021. ​Operating income for the Communications Solutions segment in 2021 was $1,023.3, or 21.2% of net sales, compared to $871.2, or 21.5% of net sales in 2020. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Communications Solutions segment for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity, logistics and supply chain environment experienced in 2021, which was largely offset by the normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2020.​Operating income for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment in 2021 was $588.1, or 17.9% of net sales, compared to $348.6, or 15.4% of net sales in 2020. The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity, logistics and supply chain environment experienced in 2021, along with the impact of the Company’s 2021 acquisitions, in particular the MTS Sensors business closed in April 2021, which operated at a lower operating margin compared to the average of the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.​Interest expense was $115.5 in 2021 compared to $115.4 in 2020. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.​Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 20.6% in 2021 and 20.5% in 2020. Provision for income taxes in 2021 included (i) excess tax benefits of $63.4 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, all of which was partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2020 included (i) excess tax benefits of $42.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, which were partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.3% and 24.5% for 2021 and 2020, 34 Table of Contentsrespectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS were $1,569.4 and $2.51, respectively, for 2021, compared to $1,203.4 and $1.96, respectively, for 2020. Excluding the effect of the items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,548.4 and $2.48, respectively, for 2021, compared to $1,151.4 and $1.87, respectively, for 2020.​The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all on a continuing operations basis only, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021​2020​​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​ ​​​​​​Net Income​​​​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​​​​​attributable​Effective​​​​​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​Operating​Operating​to Amphenol​Tax ​Diluted​​Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) ​EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) ​EPSReported (GAAP)​$ 2,105.1 19.4% $ 1,569.4​ 20.6% $ 2.51​$ 1,638.4 19.1% $ 1,203.4​ 20.5% $ 1.96Acquisition-related expenses ​​ 70.4​ 0.6​​ 57.3​ (0.2)​​ 0.09​​ 11.5​ 0.1​​ 10.7​ (0.1)​​ 0.02Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation​​ —​ —​​ (63.4)​ 3.2​​ (0.10)​​ —​ —​​ (42.8)​ 2.8​​ (0.07)Discrete tax item​​ —​ —​​ (14.9)​ 0.7​​ (0.02)​​ —​ —​​ (19.9)​ 1.3​​ (0.03)Adjusted (non-GAAP) (2)​$ 2,175.5​ 20.0% $ 1,548.4​ 24.3% $ 2.48​$ 1,649.9​ 19.2% $ 1,151.4​ 24.5% $ 1.87​Note: All data in the tables above are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude results associated with discontinued operations.​(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(2)All percentages and per share amounts in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.​​Liquidity and Capital Resources​Liquidity and Cash Requirements​At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,434.2 and $1,241.4, respectively, with the vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand located outside of the United States.​The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, as well as availability under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2022 Term Loan (all of which are defined and discussed in more detail below within this Item 7). The Company believes that these sources of liquidity, along with access to capital markets, provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term (next 12 months) and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations.​Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations ​The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and working capital needs, capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of our Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”), which is payable in annual installments until 2025, taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), funding of pension obligations, and other contractual obligations and commitments (refer to the table below for the Company’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2023 will be in a range of 35 Table of Contents3% to 4% of net sales. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, and to the extent of any amounts outstanding, the Revolving Credit Facility, Commercial Paper Programs and the 2022 Term Loan (all as defined below). As of December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program were at a weighted average floating interest rate of 4.69%, while there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan and Euro Commercial Paper Program. As a result of recent increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program increased substantially over the course of 2022, a trend that could continue throughout 2023. Consequently, the Company currently expects the floating interest rates related to its U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as its Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) to continue to increase in the first quarter of 2023 and potentially beyond, which is expected to result in increased interest expense in 2023 as compared to 2022. Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2023, primarily due to our current expected limited reliance on borrowings tied to floating rates of interest, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels. ​The following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to certain contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2022, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments are expected to be satisfied.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations ​​ Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (dollars in millions)​Total​1 year​years​years​5 years Debt (1)​$ 4,602.7​$ 2.7​$ 750.9​$ 1,168.9​$ 2,680.2​Interest related to senior notes​ 596.4​ 97.6​ 174.2​ 152.3​ 172.3​Operating leases (2)​ 316.1​ 91.5​ 115.5​ 60.2​ 48.9​Purchase obligations (3)​ 878.7​ 835.7​ 38.0​ 3.1​ 1.9​Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations (4)​ 57.9​ 6.8​ 11.1​ 11.3​ 28.7​Transition tax (5)​ 70.4​ 29.6​ 40.8​ —​ —​Total (6)​$ 6,522.2​$ 1,063.9​$ 1,130.5​$ 1,395.8​$ 2,932.0​(1)The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2022, were approximately $21.1. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by items such as future acquisitions, repurchases of Common Stock and dividend payments, as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.​(2)The Company’s operating lease payments included in this table reflect the future minimum undiscounted fixed lease payments, which serve as the basis for calculating the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The table above excludes any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, due to their uncertainty. Finance leases are not material to the Company individually or in the aggregate and as such have been excluded from the table above. ​(3)Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production.​(4)This table includes estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans, the most significant of which covers certain of its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in the United States (“U.S. Plans”) due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2023. The Company did not make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. Plans in 2022 and 2021. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2023 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.​(5)As a result of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) in December 2017, the United States changed to a modified territorial tax system, which significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed the Transition Tax associated with all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted and finalized in 2018. The Transition Tax is to be paid in annual installments over the eight-year period until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. The table above reflects the remaining amounts associated with the Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions. The fifth installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the second quarter of 2022. ​(6)As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded net liabilities of approximately $193.5 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows. It is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid.​Repatriation of Foreign Earnings and Related Income Taxes​The Company has previously indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2022 accumulated earnings and has accrued the foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings, as appropriate. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining pre-2022 foreign earnings. The Company intends to distribute certain 2022 foreign earnings and, as of December 31, 2022, has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, where applicable, on those foreign earnings that we intend to repatriate, and intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 2022 foreign earnings. The Company intends to (i) evaluate certain 36 Table of Contentspost-2022 earnings for repatriation, and will accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and (ii) indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. In addition, the Company paid its fifth annual installment of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in the second quarter of 2022, and will pay the balance of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments over the remainder of the eight-year period ending 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,100 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.​Cash Flow Summary​The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended December 31, ​ 2022 2021 2020Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations​$ 2,174.6​$ 1,523.9​$ 1,592.0Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations​ (731.1)​ (2,604.4)​ (333.5)Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations​ (1,196.7)​ (145.1)​ (516.6)Net cash change from discontinued operations​​ —​​ 733.0​​ —Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents​ (70.8)​ (12.3)​ 68.9Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents​$ 176.0​$ (504.9)​$ 810.8Note: Net cash change from discontinued operations in the table above includes the proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business during the year ended December 31, 2021, as discussed in further detail later within this Item 7.​Operating Activities​The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Operating Cash Flow was $2,174.6 in 2022, compared to $1,523.9 in 2021 and $1,592.0 in 2020. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to both an increase in net income from continuing operations and a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below. The decrease in Operating Cash Flow in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below, partially offset by an increase in net income from continuing operations.​In 2022, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $193.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in inventories of $278.5 and accounts receivable of $273.1, partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $246.3 and accounts payable of $62.5, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $49.7. In 2021, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $496.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $398.4, $263.0 and $20.2, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $131.7 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $53.5. In 2020, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $38.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $146.3, $102.0 and $88.6, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $204.3 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $93.7.​The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Accounts receivable increased $176.5 to $2,631.3 primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, along with the impact of the two acquisitions (collectively, the “2022 Acquisitions”) that closed during 2022, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes (“Translation”) at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 73 days and 71 days, respectively. Inventories increased $199.5 to $2,093.6, which was primarily driven by the impact of higher sales and the 2022 Acquisitions, along with the impact of the ongoing supply chain disruptions experienced throughout 2022, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 86 days and 80 days, respectively. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $47.9 to $320.0, primarily due to decreases in certain other current receivables. Property, plant and 37 Table of Contentsequipment, net, increased $29.0 to $1,204.3, primarily due to capital expenditures of $383.8 and the impact of the 2022 Acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $306.1, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $69.3 to $6,446.1, primarily driven by goodwill recognized resulting from the 2022 Acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Other intangible assets, net, decreased $22.8 to $734.1 due to the amortization of $81.0 related to the Company’s current intangible assets, partially offset by the recognition of certain intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. Other long-term assets increased $51.4 to $462.6, primarily due to (i) the purchase of long-term certificates of deposit investments and (ii) an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets resulting from new and renewed lease agreements entered into during 2022, along with leases assumed from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid pension assets resulting from a decrease in the overfunded status of certain pension plans primarily in the U.S. Accounts payable decreased $2.9 to $1,309.1, primarily due to Translation, largely offset by slightly increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, along with the effect of the 2022 Acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 54 days and 56 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $233.2 to $1,364.3, primarily as a result of increases in accrued income taxes, accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits and certain other accrued expenses, partially offset by Translation. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $65.5 to $127.9, primarily driven by a significant decrease in our projected benefit obligations resulting from higher interest rates, along with Translation, partially offset by negative returns on plan assets in 2022.​In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $6.3, $6.8 and $6.5, respectively. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the Company’s U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, if any, as discussed in more detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the increase in capital expenditures to support our strong sales growth and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The following table is on a continuing operations basis only and excludes any cash flows related to discontinued operations:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 2021 2020Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) $ 2,174.6 $ 1,523.9 $ 1,592.0Capital expenditures (GAAP)​ (383.8)​ (360.4)​ (276.8)Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (GAAP)​ 5.6​ 3.7​ 12.7Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)​$ 1,796.4​$ 1,167.2​$ 1,327.9​Investing Activities​Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net purchases (sales and maturities) of short- and long-term investments, and acquisitions. ​Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $731.1 in 2022, compared to $2,604.4 in 2021 and $333.5 in 2020. In 2022, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $378.2, the use of $288.2 to fund acquisitions, net purchases of long-term investments of $56.0, and net purchases of short-term investments of $25.2. In 2021, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by the use of $2,225.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $356.7, and net purchases of short-term investments of $8.6. In 2020, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $264.1, the use of $50.4 to fund acquisitions, and net purchases of short-term investments of $18.4. ​38 Table of ContentsFinancing Activities​Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of Common Stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. ​Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1,196.7 in 2022, compared to $145.1 in 2021 and $516.6 in 2020. In 2022, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $730.5, (ii) dividend payments of $477.4, (iii) net repayments of $159.3, primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, (iv) other debt repayments of $55.2, primarily related to short-term debt, and (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $9.9, partially offset by (a) cash proceeds of $185.3 from the exercise of stock options and (b) proceeds of $50.7 primarily related to short-term borrowings. In 2021, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by (i) debt repayments of $912.6, primarily related to the repayment of the assumed then-outstanding MTS senior notes in the second quarter of 2021 as well as the redemption of the 3.125% Senior Notes (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in the third quarter of 2021 and the redemption of the 4.00% Senior Notes (the “2022 Senior Notes”) in the fourth quarter of 2021, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $661.7, (iii) dividend payments of $346.7, (iv) a cash transfer of $28.7 made by the Company’s continuing operations to its discontinued operations in order to fund the September 2021 payment of contingent consideration assumed as part of the MTS acquisition, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.9, (vi) payments of $9.3 related to debt financing costs associated with the Company’s $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.200% Senior Notes due September 15, 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes”), and (vii) payments of $4.1 associated with the deferred purchase price related to acquisitions, partially offset by (a) net borrowings of $796.3 primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the majority of the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions, including MTS, and to redeem the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2022 Senior Notes, (b) net cash proceeds of $752.1, primarily related to the September 2021 issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, and (c) cash proceeds of $288.5 from the exercise of stock options.

The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, the 2022 Term Loan, and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. ​On November 30, 2021, the Company amended and restated its $2,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As a result, the Revolving Credit Facility no longer references the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for interest rate determinations. The Revolving Credit Facility maintains the lenders’ aggregate commitments under the facility at $2,500.0. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in November 2026 and gives the Company the ability to borrow, in various currencies, at a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. On December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. ​39 Table of ContentsAlthough the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, previously announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR in 2023, the Company does not currently have nor does it expect to have any more reliance on borrowings or any other financial instruments tied to LIBOR. As a result, the LIBOR transition will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ​On April 19, 2022, the Company entered into a two-year, $750.0 unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “2022 Term Loan”), which is scheduled to mature on April 19, 2024. The 2022 Term Loan was undrawn at closing and may be drawn on up to five occasions over the life of the facility. The 2022 Term Loan may be repaid at any time without premium or penalty, and, once repaid, cannot be reborrowed. When drawn upon, the proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest rates under the 2022 Term Loan are based on a spread over either the base rate or the adjusted term SOFR, which spread varies based on the Company’s debt rating. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not yet drawn upon the 2022 Term Loan, and as such, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan. The 2022 Term Loan requires payment of certain commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants, which financial covenants are the same as those under the Revolving Credit Facility. On December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2022 Term Loan. ​The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0. The Company utilizes borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes, which in recent years, have included fully or partially funding acquisitions, as well as repaying certain outstanding senior notes, such as (i) the third quarter 2021 redemption of its unsecured 2021 Senior Notes due September 15, 2021, of which $227.7 aggregate principal amount was then outstanding and (ii) the fourth quarter 2021 redemption of its unsecured 2022 Senior Notes due February 1, 2022, of which $295.0 aggregate principal amount was then outstanding. The amount of USCP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was $632.8, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.69% As of December 31, 2021, the amount of USCP Notes outstanding was $795.2, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.29%.​The Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also have a commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. dollars or other currencies. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no ECP Notes outstanding. ​Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2022, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) limits the maximum principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper or similar programs, along with outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, at any time to $2,500.0 in the aggregate. The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and, based on the Board’s authorization described above, are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.​40 Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:​​​​​​​Principal Interest ​Amount Rate​Maturity$ 350.0 3.20% April 2024​ 400.0 2.050% March 2025​ 500.0 4.350% June 2029​ 900.0 2.80% February 2030​ 750.0​2.200% September 2031​​​​​​€ 500.0​0.750% May 2026 (Euro Notes)​ 500.0 2.00% October 2028 (Euro Notes)​On September 14, 2021, the Company issued the 2031 Senior Notes. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.​All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (the “U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.​The Euro Issuer has two outstanding unsecured senior notes issued in Europe. In 2020, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $545.4 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 0.750% Senior Notes due May 4, 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility. In addition, the Euro Issuer also has €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 (the “2028 Euro Notes”, together with the 2026 Euro Notes, the “Euro Notes”, and collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes and the U.S. Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under our Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. The Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on each series of Euro Notes is payable annually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of either series of Euro Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.​The Company’s Senior Notes impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements. On December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all requirements under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.​On April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased 9.9 million and 6.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $730.5 and $457.9, respectively, under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2022 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 9.3 million shares, or $689.7, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase. Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 5.8 million shares, or $424.9, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase. From January 1, 2023 through January 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $48.8, and, as of February 1, 2023, the Company has remaining authorization to purchase up to $762.8 of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases will depend on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Common Stock. ​In April 2018, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $2,000.0 of Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $203.8 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase 41 Table of ContentsProgram. As a result of these purchases, the Company completed all purchases authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, and, therefore, the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program was terminated. Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, 2.8 million shares, or $184.0, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 12.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $641.3 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2020, 9.3 million shares, or $487.4, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.​Contingent upon declaration by the Board, the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On October 26, 2021, the Board approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from $0.145 per share to $0.20 per share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2021, and on October 25, 2022, approved an additional increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from $0.20 per share to $0.21 per share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2022, contingent upon declaration by the Board. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 ​2021 ​2020First Quarter​$ 0.20​$ 0.145​$ 0.125Second Quarter​​ 0.20​​ 0.145​​ 0.125Third Quarter​​ 0.20​​ 0.145​​ 0.125Fourth Quarter​​ 0.21​​ 0.20​​ 0.145Total​$ 0.81​$ 0.635​$ 0.52​The following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2022 ​2021 ​2020Dividends declared​$ 482.6​$ 379.7​$ 310.0Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year)​ 477.4​ 346.7​ 297.6​Pensions​The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. The majority of U.S. employees are not covered by the U.S. Plans and are instead covered by various defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations associated with the Company’s underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2022 to $111.1 from $173.9 in 2021, primarily driven by a significant decrease in our projected benefit obligations resulting from higher interest rates, along with foreign currency exchange translation, partially offset by negative returns on plan assets in 2022. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, if any.​Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.​Acquisitions and Divestitures​During 2022, the Company completed two acquisitions (the “2022 Acquisitions”) for $288.2, net of cash acquired. One of the 2022 Acquisitions was included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment and the other acquisition was included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment. The 2022 Acquisitions, which were funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand, were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.​42 Table of ContentsDuring 2021, the Company completed seven acquisitions (the “2021 Acquisitions”) for $2,225.4, net of cash acquired, while also completing the divestiture of the Divested MTS business, as defined and discussed below. One of the 2021 Acquisitions was included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, three acquisitions were included in the Communications Solutions segment and three acquisitions were included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment. The 2021 Acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.​Acquisition of MTS​On April 7, 2021, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated December 9, 2020, by and among the Company and MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”), the Company completed the acquisition of MTS for a total enterprise value of approximately $1,700, net of cash acquired and including the repayment of all outstanding debt and certain liabilities. The MTS acquisition was funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand. At closing, the Company paid approximately $1,300, net of cash acquired, for 100% of the common stock of MTS, including certain liabilities settled at closing, which was reflected within Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company also assumed MTS’s then-outstanding $350.0 principal amount of senior notes due August 15, 2027. Shortly after the closing, the Company repaid and settled the MTS senior notes for approximately $387.3, which included accrued interest and a make-whole premium incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of the senior notes. The repayment of the outstanding senior notes, including the make-whole premium and excluding interest, was reflected within Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. MTS, a leading global supplier of precision sensors, advanced test systems and motion simulators, was historically organized into two business segments: Sensors (“MTS Sensors”) and Test & Simulation (“MTS T&S”). The retained MTS Sensors business provides the Company with a highly complementary offering of high-technology, harsh environment sensors sold into diverse end markets and applications. The MTS Sensors business further expands the Company’s range of sensor and sensor-based products across a wide array of industries and is reported as part of our continuing operations and within our Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company incurred $55.4 ($44.6 after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition.​Sale of the Divested MTS Business​On January 19, 2021 and prior to the closing of the MTS acquisition, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) to Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”). Throughout this Annual Report, we refer to MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) as the “Divested MTS business”. As a result of the agreement to sell the Divested MTS business to ITW, the Divested MTS business met the discontinued operations reporting criteria and “held for sale” accounting criteria as of the MTS acquisition date of April 7, 2021, and therefore, the Company did not assign the Divested MTS business to any of its reportable business segments. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the operating results and related cash flows associated with the Divested MTS business as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements through December 1, 2021, the date of the sale of the Divested MTS business to ITW. Income from discontinued operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, net of income taxes, was $21.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021. On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the Divested MTS business for approximately $750, net of cash divested and excluding related transaction fees and expenses. The proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business were included in Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amphenol has had no continuing involvement with the Divested MTS business after the completion of the sale. After giving effect to the sale of the Divested MTS business as well as the repayment of the aforementioned MTS senior notes as part of the MTS acquisition, the Company paid approximately $950, net of cash acquired and excluding related transaction fees and expenses, for the retained MTS Sensors business. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the completed divestiture of the Divested MTS business.​43 Table of ContentsAcquisition of Halo Technology Limited​On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 97% of the common stock of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) for a purchase price of approximately $694, net of cash acquired. The sellers retained a noncontrolling interest of less than 3% in Halo, which includes redeemable features that are outside the control of the Company and therefore, has been classified as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as discussed in more detail in Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Halo, which is headquartered in the United States (California), is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components, with product offerings that are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic interconnect solutions for the communications infrastructure markets. The operating results for Halo have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date. Halo is reported within our Communications Solutions segment.​Acquisition-related Expenses​In 2022, the Company incurred $21.5 ($18.4 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, along with external transaction costs. In 2021, the Company incurred $70.4 ($57.3 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the Halo acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. Such acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.​For further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, as well as the Company’s discontinued operations and completed divestiture of the Divested MTS business, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​Environmental Matters​Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​Inflation and Costs​The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may include regulatory restrictions and also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company. While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, in 2021 and 2022, there were supply chain and logistical challenges that impacted the global economy, including our Company, and caused and continue to cause supply constraints and commodity price increases on certain raw materials and components used by the Company in production, as well as decreased availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. As of December 31, 2022, while some of the supply chain and logistical challenges have eased, inflation continues to impact the cost of certain raw materials and components used by the Company. Given this environment, the Company may experience supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components in the future, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation. For a discussion of certain risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​44 Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange Rates​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to mitigate currency risk in a number of ways, such as locating factories in the same country or region in which products are sold, hedging contracts, cost reduction and pricing actions or working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that any or all such actions taken by the Company will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results can be positively or negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.​Non-GAAP Financial Measures​In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures, defined below, as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Board and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS from continuing operations exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in the presentation of such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions. Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures presented within this Item 7 are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude any results associated with discontinued operations. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. ​The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: ​●Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.​●Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.​45 Table of Contents●Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.​●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income).​●Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.​●Free Cash Flow is defined as (i) Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less (ii) capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), all of which are derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to stockholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.​●Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of (i) changes in foreign currency exchange rates (described above), which is outside the control of the Company, and (ii) acquisitions, both of which are taken as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales. The acquisition impact represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current year period(s) and/or prior comparable year period(s) presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. ​Recent Accounting Pronouncements​Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including those adopted by the Company.​​Critical Accounting Estimates​The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical since they require significant assumptions and judgments that inherently are subject to risks and uncertainties. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.​Revenue Recognition ​The Company’s net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified 46 Table of Contentsperformance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price. ​The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point or (ii) when the product arrives at its destination. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​Standard product warranty coverage, which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, is typically offered, while extended or separately priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends. ​Income Taxes​Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,100 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. ​The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.​As a result of the Tax Act, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.47 Table of Contents​Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk(amounts in millions)​The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.​Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk​The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to mitigate currency risk in a number of ways, such as locating factories in the same country or region in which products are sold, hedging contracts, cost reduction and pricing actions or working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that any or all such actions taken by the Company will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. ​One of the Company’s wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) has two outstanding unsecured senior notes issued in Europe (collectively, the “Euro Notes”), each of which were issued with a principal amount of €500.0. The 0.750% Euro Senior Notes, which were issued in May 2020, mature on May 4, 2026, while the 2.000% Euro Senior Notes, which were issued in October 2018, mature on October 8, 2028. The Company and the Euro Issuer also have a commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue, outside of the United States, short-term unsecured commercial paper notes. While the Euro Notes are denominated in Euros, the Company may borrow, from time to time, under the Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Commercial Paper Program, and such borrowings have been and may continue to be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro. When borrowing in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which such borrowings are made. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of debt.​The Company also utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for exposures associated with (i) certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and (ii) net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries from which we expect to repatriate earnings to the United States. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of such foreign exchange forward contracts was not material. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes, and our derivative financial instruments are with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments.​Interest Rate Risk​The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company currently has various fixed rate senior notes outstanding, in both the United States and Europe, with various maturity dates, the most recent of which was issued in 2021. In September 2021, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.200% Senior Notes due September 15, 2031, the net proceeds of which were used to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.​Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Similarly, any borrowings under the two-year, $750.0 unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “2022 48 Table of ContentsTerm Loan”) entered into by the Company in April of 2022, bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over either the base rate or the adjusted term SOFR. Any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $640, or 14%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates; the Company’s weighted average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2022 was 4.69%. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $804, or 17%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings, primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates; the Company’s weighted average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2021 was 0.29%. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan, and Euro Commercial Paper Program. As a result of recent increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program increased substantially over the course of 2022, a trend that could continue throughout 2023. Consequently, the Company currently expects the floating interest rates related to its U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as its Revolving Credit Facility and 2022 Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) to continue to increase in the first quarter of 2023 and potentially beyond, which is expected to result in increased interest expense in 2023 as compared to 2022. A 10% change in the interest rate at December 31, 2022 and 2021 under our Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Term Loan or Commercial Paper Programs would not have a material effect on interest expense. Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2023, primarily due to our current expected limited reliance on borrowings tied to floating rates of interest, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.​49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:46:56.802429
